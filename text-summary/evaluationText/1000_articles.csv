"Turkey Attacks EU Headscarf Ruling, Says Strengthens ’Anti-Muslim Trends’","ISTANBUL (AFP)  —   Turkey on Tuesday attacked a ruling by the EU’s top court that European companies can ban employees from wearing religious or political symbols including the Islamic headscarf, saying it would intensify   sentiment. [“The European Court of Justice decision on the headscarf today will only strengthen   and xenophobic trends,” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said in a tweet.  “Quo vadis Europa? (Where is Europe going? )” he added. The response came as Turkey is locked in a mighty row with Germany, the Netherlands and other EU states over the blocking of Turkish officials from holding rallies abroad in the campaign for a referendum on expanding Erdogan’s powers. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) said it does not constitute “direct discrimination” if a firm has an internal rule banning the wearing of “any political, philosophical or religious sign. ” The   court was considering the case of a Muslim woman fired by the security company G4S in Belgium after she insisted on wearing a headscarf. Turkey last month said it was lifting a historic ban on female officers wearing the Islamic headscarf in the country’s officially secular armed forces, the last institution where the wearing of the garment was forbidden."
Jeff Sessions: ’The Border Is Not Open - Please Don’t Come’ - Breitbart,"Tuesday on Fox News Channel’s “Hannity,” U. S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions explained to host Sean Hannity how border security has changed since President Donald Trump took office nearly three months ago.  Sessions went on to add it was the intention of the Trump administration to send the message the border was not open. “[C]an you believe that we have had the lowest number of entrances at the border in 17 years? This is the direct result of Donald Trump’s strong, clear leadership. It has an impact. The most important thing for us is to send a message to the world that the border is not open. Please don’t come. You will be apprehended if you do come, and you will be deported promptly. And if you’re a criminal, you’ll be prosecuted. And if you assault our officers, we’re going to come at you with a ton of bricks. This is the kind of message we need to send. It is already being sent. It is having a dramatic effect so far. I knew strong presidential leadership unlike the   we’ve seen in the past would impact the flow, but not as much as we’ve seen already. The numbers are down 70 percent since President Obama left office. It is really a remarkable achievement. ” (  RCP Video) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"

ACORN: Obama Campaign Voter Registrations Removed Prior to Ohio Primary - Breitbart,"HOUSTON, Texas  —   Election integrity and voters’ rights organization True the Vote announced that it successfully worked with officials in Ohio to remove duplicate voter registrations prior to the Ohio primary. These registrations were originally submitted by   and Democrat organizations, including ACORN. [Approximately 30 percent of voters registered twice in the Cleveland area and they did so with falsified birth dates, social security numbers, and other identification. These were submitted not only by ACORN, but by Field Works, The Strategy Network, Organizing for America, and other    organizations, says True the Vote (TTV) in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas.  Upon receipt of True the Vote’s research, 711 duplicate voter registrations were removed in Cuyahoga County and 465 sets were processed in Franklin County. TTV says it has been notified that thousands of duplicate voter registrations have also been removed in North Carolina. “Because of Ohio’s consistent role as a decisive swing state in America’s elections, it has a duty to ensure that its voter records are in the best shape possible,” True the Vote Founder Catherine Engelbrecht said. “Having duplicate voters in Ohio’s poll books not only creates confusion at the polling place, but raises the possibility of fraudulent double voting. The Buckeye State has recently seen   just how far some are willing to go to see their candidate or cause win. ” TTV notes that the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) had a “  track record” of giving local election officials questionable voter registration forms for years, especially in Midwestern and other political battleground states. ACORN bragged about submitting more than 1. 3 million voter registrations in 2008 alone. After the organization was formally shutdown, 18 employees were convicted or admitted guilt to committing election crimes. A large percentage of the work that ACORN engaged in has been officially questioned. A Cleveland man said he was given cash and cigarettes by ACORN in exchange for registering 72 times. The complaints started an investigation into the organization and witnesses were subpoenaed to testify against the organization. The New York Post reported in 2009 that eleven ACORN workers in Florida were arrested after submitting approximately 1, 400 applications of which about 900 were falsified. More than 2, 000 applications were falsified in Indiana and submitted just hours before the registration deadline. As it relates to the 30 percent of Cleveland voters that registered twice, TTV founder Engelbrecht said, “While many voter records may become duplicated due to data management breakdowns, you have a different issue entirely when nearly a third of the irregularities show a pattern of intentional forgery. ” Engelbrecht warned, “Americans working in the polls and casting ballots must be extra vigilant this year to help spot irregularities that can throw an entire election into question. ” True the Vote describes itself as “an   501( c)(3) voters’ rights organization, founded to inspire and equip voters for involvement at every stage of our electoral process. TTV empowers organizations and individuals across the nation to actively protect the rights of legitimate voters, regardless of their political party affiliation. ” For more information about the organization you can visit www. truethevote. org. Although True the Vote cannot bring citizen challenges regarding voter registration files, the organization may review maintenance records held by counties. TTV has the authority to do this pursuant to public inspection rights under the National Voter Registration Act. In August 2012, True the Vote brought a federal lawsuit against the State of Ohio over allegations of voter roll maintenance failures and found three counties with more registered voters than   residents. In January 2014, the suit ended in a favorable settlement agreement with measurable reductions in artificial voter rolls thereafter. Lana Shadwick is a writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

"As Trump Prepares Policy Shift, Human Rights Groups Clash with Pro-Cuba Interests - Breitbart","WASHINGTON, DC  —   President Donald Trump is expected to announce a restructuring of American policy towards Cuba in Florida on Friday. [Observers expect the Trump Cuba policy to roll back some of the measures former President Barack Obama put into place to allow more robust business cooperation with that country’s communist government.  Those rollbacks may include the reinstatement of some travel restrictions for U. S. citizens following a review by the National Security Council, multiple media outlets are reporting. “Trump is expected to use tough rhetoric against the Cuban government in calling for tightening rules for U. S. travel to the country,” the Washington Examiner reported on Tuesday. “He is also expected to call for blocking commerce with entities that benefit the Cuban military. ” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday that Obama’s Cuba policy has not changed “the behavior of the regime in Cuba and its treatment of people. ” Tillerson said that, in fact, the communist government may be the biggest benefactor of Obama’s Cuba policy. Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation (VOC) Executive Director Marion Smith said in a statement that she hopes the current administration will impose new restrictions against the communist dictatorship if the Cuban regime does not make the political reforms necessary to improve the lives of its citizens. “Despite claims that detente with Cuba will lead to new freedoms for the Cuban people, an influx of capital and tourism has only further fueled the Castro government’s repressive policies,” Smith said. “Despite assurances to the contrary, the past two years have witnessed only more government crackdowns and imprisonment of political dissidents and no steps toward improving Cuba’s abysmal human rights record. ” “President Trump should use this opportunity to push the Cuban government to release its political prisoners, allow for dissent, and adhere to international standards on human rights,” Smith said. The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation (VOC) is a     educational and human rights organization with a mission to commemorate the more than 100 million victims of communism around the world and to obtain freedom for those still living under totalitarian regimes. The number of arbitrary  —   and often violent  —   arrests of dissidents in Cuba for their political beliefs skyrocketed following the 2014 announcement from President Obama that he was willing to cooperate with the Castro regime. During Obama’s visit to the island in 2016, the Cuban government arrested nearly 500 people for expressing   views in public. Meanwhile,   government media outlets reporting that lobbying and advocacy groups that benefit from Obama’s policy have placed Trump “under pressure” to maintain “normalization” policies. “  activist group Center for Democracy in the Americas (CDA) has urged the president to rethink his hitherto   stance on America’s former cold war foe, claiming that the cutting of improved relations would do nothing to help Cuban citizens or serve the U. S.’s national interests,” CNBC reported. “A rollback of recent progress in U. S.  relations would be out of step with the views of the majority of the American public —  both Republican and Democrat —  and would threaten the significant gains reaped by the American people and the Cuban people since the restoration of U. S.  ties,” CDA’s Executive Director Emily Mendrala said on Tuesday. Trump will make his Cuba policy announcement on Friday in Miami."
"From Flight 370 Hunt, New Insight Into Indian Ocean’s Unknown Depths - The New York Times","On March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished with 239 passengers and crew aboard as it crossed the Indian Ocean, triggering a   search for its remains that lasted nearly three years. As a byproduct of the tragedy, scientists have gained access to more than 100, 000 square miles of seafloor mapped at a level of detail that provides a rare look at the ocean’s geological processes. “It’s an incredible trove of data,” said Millard F. Coffin, a marine geophysicist from the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies at the University of Tasmania in Australia. “I’ve been working in this part of the Indian Ocean for   years and over many voyages in the eastern Indian Ocean I’ve never seen this level of resolution. ” Dr. Coffin worked with a group of about 10 scientists from Geoscience Australia, the national geosciences agency in Australia, to analyze data from the search. They were given access to   sonar information collected on ships, and data obtained by remotely operated vehicles and autonomous underwater drones. The information was provided by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which led the search. “When we look at these data, we’re constantly keeping in mind that we wouldn’t have this data if it weren’t for a terrible tragedy,” Dr. Coffin said. He and his colleagues published a summary of their findings on Wednesday in the journal EOS. Previous satellite data provided scientists with information about the Indian Ocean at a resolution of about five square kilometers, or about two square miles. With the instruments from the search ships, they have collected information at a resolution of meters, and in some locations they have used remote operating vehicles and underwater autonomous vehicles to gain detail on the scale of centimeters. The search has helped create   maps of the ocean floor that reveal its topographical complexity and will allow researchers to further investigate unique features like the oceanic plateau called Broken Ridge, and its   Diamantina Escarpment. The Flight 370 search also provided information about tectonic and volcanic activity, Dr. Coffin said. The team plans to release more detailed looks into its findings later in the year, and the full data set from the search will be made available in the middle of the year. Walter H. F. Smith, a geophysicist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the hunt for the lost jetliner highlighted how little we know about the oceans. In a paper that was also published Wednesday in the journal EOS, he and his colleagues explained how common unmapped areas of ocean are. “There are all kinds of things you can’t do if you don’t know the shape of the ocean bottom, or don’t know it properly,” Dr. Smith said. The consequences of not knowing, he said, can hinder how experts predict tsunamis, understand ocean currents, make climate forecasts, study marine life and search for missing planes. Previous studies have suggested that only 8 percent of the world’s oceans have been mapped, meaning that a ship measured an area’s depth and recorded it in a scientific database. Before Flight 370’s disappearance, only 5 percent of the southeast Indian Ocean had been mapped, Dr. Smith said. To figure out how often people fly over unmapped parts of the world’s oceans, Dr. Smith and his colleagues compared data on mapped and unmapped segments of the world’s ocean segments with a database of commercial airline routes. They found that about 60 percent of all commercial flights that cross over the ocean travel over waters with unmeasured depths. The longest contiguous route over unmapped ocean was from Kennedy International Airport in New York to Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport in China, a journey over more than 1, 200 nautical miles of unmapped ocean. “I wanted people to realize that it’s not just Malaysia Airlines straying into the southeast Indian Ocean where it shouldn’t have been,” he said. “Even when your aircraft is exactly where it’s supposed to be, it might be over unknown ocean. ”"

"Trump Doing More to Help Los Angeles’ Olympic Bid Than Obama, According to Head of LA Host Committee - Breitbart","The head of the group attempting to bring the 2024 Olympics to Los Angeles says he has a much better supporter in Donald Trump than he had in Barack Obama. [Gene Sykes, head of LA2024, spoke on Thursday at the Montgomery Conference in Santa Monica, during which he painted a picture of President Trump’s involvement in the Olympic bidding process that greatly contrasts with the picture presented by the media and other sports elites.  “The Donald Trump effect, for us, is a   sword,” Sykes said, according to KPCC. Sykes then went on to explain how, despite President Trump’s strong stances on immigration and other issues which have bothered some international Olympic officials, Donald Trump has been most valuable in gaining support for the Los Angeles bid. Sykes then pointed out how Trump’s efforts differ from those of his predecessor. After remarking about how Obama’s interest in the Olympics waned after an attempt to win the games for Chicago in 2016 failed, Sykes said of Obama, “He never went to an Olympic games, never met with the IOC [International Olympic Committee] leadership, never talked to them by phone, and showed sort of a disregard and that was deeply frustrating to the leaders of the IOC. ” Sykes then spoke about a situation that involved some Iranian archers who found themselves turned back at the airport in Las Vegas during President Trump’s first immigration ban. Specifically, Sykes mentioned how the President Trump intervened, “As soon as they learned they had created a problem for us they said ‘We’ll help you. We’ll solve the problem.’ ” They’ve set up a team in the White House to help us. ” Though Sykes made no mistake about the obstacles ahead with some Olympic Committee members who have serious issues with Trump, Sykes said, “The President presents an image which is a challenging image for some of these voters. They don’t like the   stance. They don’t like the presumed   rhetoric. All that is alarming to them. We’ve heard it. We continue to hear it. It’s an issue. ” Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn"
Alabama judge strikes down ban on gay marriage," (CNN) States struggling to define the question of marriage equality have an addition to their ranks: Alabama. A U. S. district judge struck down Alabama’s ban on   marriage Friday after two Mobile women sued the state for failing to recognize the couple’s union.  Cari Searcy and Kimberly McKeand were married legally in California and have been together for 15 years. But the issue of their rights as a couple came about after Searcy’s petition to adopt McKeand’s    son was denied.  Alabama’s adoption code gives a person a right to adopt a spouse’s child. But because Alabama doesn’t recognize their marriage, Searcy could not qualify for adoption.  The couple’s lawyer, David Kennedy, said McKeand and Searcy were ”very pleased with the court’s ruling.”  ”We are happy for the tens of thousands of gay Alabamians and their children,” Kennedy said. ”Justice and equality are guaranteed to everyone and we are proud to know that is true in Alabama tonight.” The state filed a motion Friday seeking to put a hold on the judge’s decision pending a ruling from the U. S. Supreme Court, effectively trying to keep couples from applying for marriage licenses in the meantime.  The Supreme Court has previously refused to hear cases from states    Indiana, Oklahoma and Wisconsin, to name a few    seeking to keep their bans against   marriage in place. But the court is expected to consider petitions from lower courts in five states where judges upheld laws banning   marriage.   If the ruling is upheld, Alabama would be the 37th state to authorize   marriage."

For starters, as a new trailer shows, Sue and Johnny Storm’s father initiates the project that ends up giving the foursome their powers. They also end up in another dimension, and we see the early flirtation between Sue Storm and Reed Richards as well. The movie, due out August 7, promises a very different take on the classic Marvel comics characters, played this   by Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Bell.

French Scientist Who Predicted Trump and Brexit Says the Maths Adds up for a Le Pen Victory,"According to French physicist Serge Galam, a victory for populist   migration presidential candidate Marine Le Pen is entirely possible due to a phenomenon known as differentiated abstention. [Professor Galam, who works as a research director at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) says the science proves the possibility of a Le Pen victory, SFR reports.  “Differentiated abstention” is the key, according to Galam, who defined the term as: “The gap between the vote intention declared in the polls and the actual vote. ” Galam says it is incredibly unlikely that those who voted for Le Pen in the first round of the French presidential elections last Sunday will vote for Macron, guaranteeing her a sizeable base. He also said it is unlikely all those who oppose Le Pen are guaranteed to support her opponent Emmanuel Macron who is unpopular with far left and conservative voters. “With less than 50 per cent of voting intentions, Marine Le Pen can end up with more than 50 per cent of the votes cast,” Galam said. Serge Galam has a history of accurate predictions over the last two years. In June of 2016, he correctly predicted the Leave campaign would win the Brexit vote. In November, he predicted Donald Trump would win the U. S. presidency, and recently predicted that popular French politician Alain Juppé would lose the Republican primary. At the start of the week, Mr. Macron enjoyed a   lead over Le Pen in the immediate aftermath of the first round election. However, Macron was outmanoeuvred by Le Pen when she visited workers at a Whirlpool plant scheduled for closure due to outsourcing in Macron’s hometown of Amiens. When Macron arrived hours later he was greeted with boos, whistles, and cries of  “Marine for President!”   family group La Manif pour Tous (“Protest for Everyone”) has also come out against Macron accusing him of having “ ” policies and valuing money over people. Macron, a former investment banker at Rothschilds  Cie Banque, is widely seen as an establishment candidate and is in favour of globalisation. Some, like Breitbart London’s James Delingpole, have compared Macron to former U. S. president Barack Obama with Mr. Delingpole calling him “the living embodiment of the French Deep State”. The former Socialist Party economy minister is also   trade and   positions which Le Pen criticised Thursday when she joined several fishermen in the early morning. She pledged to take back the sovereignty of French waters by getting France out of the European Union through a referendum on the nation’s membership.

"Gallup: Democratic Party Identification at Record Low, Most Identifying as Independents - Breitbart","While party affiliation is down across both parties, the percentage of Americans who identify as Democrats was at a record low in 2015, according to a poll released Monday. [Gallup reports that with a high percentage of Americans identifying as political independents, party affiliation for both Democrats and Republicans are at   to   lows.  In 2015, 29 percent of Americans identified as Democrats  —   a   low, according to the poll  —   lower than the poll’s previous record low of 30 percent a year earlier. Gallup notes that although the company shifted from   to telephone polling in 1988, from   the outfit never collect a yearly Democratic identification lower than 37 percent. “[M]aking it safe to conclude that the current 29% is also the low point in Gallup polling history,” Gallup’s analysis explains. While Democratic identification is at an all time low, it still has an edge over Republican identification, which was 26 percent in 2015 and remains near its record low of 25 percent in 2013. Meanwhile, for the fifth year in a row, according to Gallup, the number of U. S. adults identifying as independents was above 40 percent, with 42 percent   as independents. The result was slightly lower than the record 43 percent of Americans who identified as political independents in 2014. Gallup speculates that the decline in party affiliation and rise of the political independent is due to exasperation with the federal government and the system. “In the past several years, dissatisfaction with the government has ranked among the leading issues when U. S. adults are asked to name the most important problem facing the U. S. and was the most frequently mentioned problem in 2014 and 2015,” the poll’s analysis reads. “Also, Americans’ favorable ratings of each party are on the lower end of what Gallup has measured over the past few decades. ” When Gallup pressed independents for the party they lean toward the poll found that Democrats still have a slight edge over Republicans  —   with 45 percent of the population identifying as Democrats or Democratic leaners and 42 percent as Republican or Republican leaners. The results come from combined data of interviews conducted throughout 2015 among a sample of 12, 137 adults. It has a margin of error of +  percentage point."

Possession obsession: Donning the Zaouli mask," (CNN)”The leaves of the tree may touch the sky, but it should not forget that its roots are fixed in the soil.” Chief Hyppolite Anoh, artistic director of SOTHECA is full of wise words. It’s also his job to anchor a nation to its cultural roots. SOTHECA, a village just outside of Ivory Coast’s economic capital Abidjan, stands for Solidarity Theatre Club of Abidjan. The village has become a hub where traditional art, dance, songs and rhythms are being preserved.   Read: The masked men of Burkina Faso, ”We noticed there was a problem,” says Anoh, ”Ivorian rhythms are disappearing.” So Anoh and others decided to boost Ivorian traditions by   the youth with what could so easily be forgotten. Central to these traditions    and among the most popular with audiences, domestic and foreign    is the Zaouli mask dance. It’s a phenomenon which has crossed borders and astonished crowds in Burkina Faso at Festima, the International Festival of Masks and the Arts.  Donning a Zaouli mask has a profound effect on its wearer. The process is taken seriously and filming it is prohibited. Only the initiated are permitted to bear witness    and women are strictly forbidden. ”The bearer changes,” Anoh explains, ”the spirits take control of him. He is separated from all that happens around him. .. Once he will put the mask on, it will not be him again that will be dancing, but the spirit that will possess his body.” In Ivory Coast, people consulted masks when danger was coming, the chief explains. Some masks protect villages, some counter bad spalls others are used to rejoice. Each Zaouli mask can take as long as six days to carve. Made of Yaranza wood, the process is secretive, each artisan using their own approach. Ouagene Coulibaly, president of the Association of the Village Artisans of Bassam, will show CNN his work in progress, but refuses to divulge how he finishes his unique and sacred works. When it happens the dance is fast and furious, the masked man churning up dust beneath his feet. Provoked to keep up the pace by his dance partner, it’s a superhuman effort guided by the spirits.  Anoh and his team at SOTHECA will be hoping they can guide the spirits into the next generation, ensuring there’s always an occasion to dance."

"Islamic State Targeting U.S. Air Bases In Mideast, Claims Israeli Hackers","TEL AVIV  —   The Islamic State plans to attack U. S. bases in Kuwait, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia, an Israeli   company that claims to have hacked the terror group’s communications warned on Wednesday. [Intsights, an intelligence company run by former IDF intelligence officers, hacked into the Islamic State’s account on Telegram, an encrypted messaging platform on the dark web. The organization uses the platform to disseminate targets and terror attack plans to its 500 leading operatives, the Times of Israel reported, citing Israel’s Channel 10.  Among the targets uploaded to the group was the church in Normandy, France where a local priest was murdered on July 26 by terrorists claiming allegiance to IS. “Telegram is completely encrypted and there’s no fear (among its users) that someone will intercept the messages and understand what you wrote,” Intsights   Arvatz told Channel 10. A list of “extremely specific targets” was published, including air force bases in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and other countries of Western Europe, as well as Israeli air force bases. Arvatz added that there were a number of “priority targets” including air fields in Kuwait, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia that are being used by the U. S.  coalition to attack IS targets. Arvatz did not explain exactly how his company managed to hack into the group, but said that you have to be introduced by someone within the group in order to be accepted. “I need to know someone who can vouch for me that I’m cleared for the group, and only then can I join,” he said. Arvatz added that the Telegram group would doubtless be shut down now that the lid had been blown on Israeli television. The Insights hack is the second known hack on the Telegram platform in a week. On Tuesday, the Verge reported that 15 million Iranian users of Telegram were hacked by a group believed to be affiliated with Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps."
Egypt Begins Rebuilding Christian Churches Destroyed Under Muslim Brotherhood - Breitbart,"The Egyptian military has started rebuilding destroyed Christian churches and properties, years after the Muslim Brotherhood tore the buildings down. [On Christmas Eve, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah   apologized to the nation’s Christian population and reiterated his pledge to rebuild the churches. He initially made the promise when he took office in 2013.  “In this occasion, I want to exhort you all, let no one come between us,” he declared. “Nothing can harm us, not our economic conditions or political conditions. Unless we diverge, we can overcome anything. ” He added: “We have taken too long to fix and renovate [churches] that were burned   …     This year everything will be fixed. Please accept our apologies for what happened   …     God willing   …     by next year there won’t be a single church or house that is not restored. ” The military began reconstructing the churches destroyed in August 2013 after the government removed protesters staging   for   Mohamed Morsi.   minister   vowed to fix the churches. Muslims joined efforts to raise money to build a new Coptic Church just north of Cairo in April. Coptic Orthodox Bishop Benyamin started a fund to build a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary. He asked his parishioners to reach people near and far to donate towards the church. Islamic leaders in the area heard about the fund and asked Muslims to also donate money. “Most of our people are afraid,” explained Father Mina Adel, a priest at the Church of Two Saints in Alexandria. “Not a few are leaving  —   for America, Canada and Australia. Dozens of families from this church alone are trying to go too. ” Egypt’s   the country’s highest Muslim Sunni authority, and other Christian churches developed the Family House in 2011 after “the deadly 2011 bombing of the Two Saints Church in Alexandria. ” The group opened a specific donation account in October 2013 to raise money for the churches. Safwat   said the organization only raised “EGP 9 million and $8, 000 since the initiative started, which is a very small amount of money in relation to the damages. ” Some estimate the work will cost $25. 5 million. “I appreciate so much the president’s promise to continue the restoration process this year,” stated Bishop Macarius. “14 August 2013 marks the worst attacks in the Church’s modern history, as all Christian lives were threatened. They lost their properties in seconds, but thank God despite all the sectarian incidents and discrimination, Christianity in Egypt not only remains, but flourishes. ” In December, leaders of Egypt’s Coptic community attended a UN minority rights forum in Geneva, where they condemned the country’s blasphemy law. Medhat Kelada, head of the European Coptic Organizations Union, claims the law “badly exploited against the Copts. ” However, at the same time, the leaders praised Sisi for protecting them from the Muslim Brotherhood. Coptic Orthodox Pope Tawadros II considers the president a “hero. ” But some believe the government will not completely change. “Sisi is conservative. He doesn’t care about religious freedom,” said Mina Thabet, researcher at the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms."
Milo Tears Into Hillary-Supporting Podcast Host in Epic Free Speech Rant - Breitbart,"Breitbart’s Milo Yiannopoulos joined Chris Paul on the “None Taken” podcast recently, where he ended up tearing into Paul for his hypocrisy in supporting Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, despite being a free speech activist. [“So you’re voting for Hillary are you?” asked Milo in disappointment.  “Yes, I am. I’m a pragmatist, I want the best results,” replied Paul. “Disgusting, absolutely disgusting. As somebody who cares about culture, you should be ashamed of voting for a president who is going to make certain kinds of speech on campus illegal,” Milo proclaimed. “You’ve spent the first   minutes of this show discussing with me your distaste for all the left’s constant attack on free speech, free inquiry. Hillary Clinton, not Sanders, Hillary Clinton is the greatest imaginable threat to the free speech you cherish so much. She is the one that sucks up and panders to Black Lives Matter, more than Sanders does, which is why they charged his stage and not hers. Look at the people she appoints. Look at the black community, always votes for the Clintons. Why? Because the Clintons tell them they’re going to give them what they want, and they put people in office when they’re there. ” “I accept the pandering as a lesser evil,” interrupted Paul. “Well, not when you are arrested for ‘hate speech’ about saying the wrong thing about black crime rates. Then you won’t,” rebutted Milo. “Look at the relationship she has with the worst kind of whiny, lesbianic institutional feminism. Title nine is nothing compared to what Hillary will do to American universities when she gets in office. The way that men are treated on campuses today is deplorable, and I presume you agree with me on that, this is nothing compared to after eight years of a Clinton presidency. All of the things you claim you care about are at so much greater risk from a Hillary presidency than anybody else that ran for president in this cycle. Anybody who’s now dropped out, O’Malley, you know, or anybody on the Republican side too, there is no person running for president in this cycle of any stripe, whether they’re still running or not, more of a risk to the things you say you care about than Hillary Clinton. It is so shocking to me that you suggest you’re going to vote for her. ” “I will not deny you that, I just will  …    ” replied Paul. “So you’re gonna vote for her anyway, even though she’s the greatest threat to all the things you care about? That’s insane,” Milo expressed. You can listen to their entire encounter on the issue below: Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

"Elie Wiesel, Nobel laureate, dead at 87"," (CNN) Elie Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor and author who fought for peace, human rights and simple human decency, has died at the age of 87, a spokesman for Israel’s Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem, said Saturday. His family said he died peacefully Saturday after a long illness. ”My husband was a fighter. He fought for the memory of the 6 million Jews who perished in the Holocaust, and he fought for Israel.  He waged countless battles for innocent victims regardless of ethnicity or creed,” his widow, Marion, said in a statement released by the writer’s foundation. Wiesel, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986, recounted his family being sent to the Nazi concentration camps in his first book, ”Night,” which was published in France in 1958.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lauded Wiesel as a ”master of words.” ”(He) gave expression through his exceptional personality, and fascinating books about the victory of the human spirit over cruelty and evil. In the darkness of the Holocaust in which our brothers and sisters    6 million    were murdered, Elie Wiesel was a ray of light and greatness of humanity who believed in the good in man,” Netanyahu said. ”I was privileged to know Elie and to learn so much from him.” Born in Romania, Wiesel was 15 when he was sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland with his family in 1944. The future writer was later moved and ultimately freed from the Buchenwald camp in 1945. Of his relatives, only two of his sisters survived. Wiesel told CNN last year that Auschwitz was ”to this day, a source of shock and astonishment.” Wiesel survived because an older Jew told him to tell the Nazis he was 18, old enough to work.  He told The New York Times he had thought about why he lived and others didn’t. ”If I survived, it must be for some reason,” Wiesel said in 1981. ”I must do something with my life. It is too serious to play games with anymore, because in my place, someone else could have been saved. And so I speak for that person. On the other hand, I know I cannot.” MORE: World leaders remember Elie Wiesel, He was a ”messenger to mankind” He broke his silence on his Holocaust experience 10 years after the liberation with the acclaimed memoir ”Night,” originally published in French as ”La Nuit,” which has been translated into 30 languages and has sold millions of copies since its publication. The Nobel peace laureate, who wrote extensively about the horrors he and others endured, said he knew he’d have to write at some point but feared the words would elude him. f, ”I’m not sure, by the way, that I did find them,” he said. ”Maybe there are no words for what happened. Maybe somehow, the Germans . .. the cruel killers, have succeeded at least in one way, at least that it deprived us, the victims, of finding the proper language of saying what they had done to us, because there are no words for it.” In 1986 the Nobel committee called Wiesel an important spiritual leader. In his speech honoring Wiesel,   Egil Aarvik said: ”From the abyss of the death camps he has come as a messenger to mankind, not with a message of hate and revenge, but with one of brotherhood and atonement.” Wiesel spoke of his own guilt in his moving Nobel acceptance speech. ”Do I have the right to represent the multitudes who have perished? Do I have the right to accept this great honor on their behalf? I do not. No one may speak for the dead, no one may interpret their mutilated dreams and visions,” he said.  He said he sensed the presence of the tens of thousands of people who died at Buchenwald, and accepted the prize on their behalf and on behalf of his fellow survivors.  Millions of people were touched by ”Night” and dozens of other works Wiesel produced. His books were deeply personal. He was honest with his readers about what he went through physically, emotionally, spiritually. He wrote, ”Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed. Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky. Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever. Never shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God himself. Never.” Throughout his life, the writer and teacher sought to give a voice to the voiceless.  He was a professor at the City College of New York from 1972 until he left four years later to become a humanities professor at Boston University. Before that, Wiesel was a journalist in Paris and then New York. Michael Zank, the director of the Elie Wiesel Center for Jewish Studies at Boston University, said in an email to CNN that he was ”heartbroken at his passing.” ”Boston University is losing an iconic teacher who brought an incredible intensity to every encounter with students and colleagues,” Zank wrote.  In 1978, President Jimmy Carter appointed Wiesel chairman of the Presidential Commission on the Holocaust. Wiesel’s efforts at the commission led to the establishment of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, where his words greet visitors at the entrance. ”For the dead and the living, we must bear witness.”  He gave a voice, Wiesel was, in the words of the museum, the international leader of the Holocaust remembrance movement.  ”In the aftermath of the Holocaust, at a time when the world could not bear to remember, he could not bear to forget,” the museum wrote in a statement. ”Through his singular moral leadership, intellect, and eloquence, he gave voice to those who had been silenced forever and devoted his life to fulfilling the promise of ’never again’ for all future victims of genocide.” Wiesel also didn’t shy away from making strong remarks. While at the White House in 1985, he asked President Ronald Reagan to cancel a visit to a World War II military cemetery in West Germany. ”That place, Mr. President, is not your place,’’ he said, according to The New York Times. ’’Your place is with the victims of the SS. ’’ Reagan wasn’t the only President whom Wiesel pushed to effect change. ”As he often said, one person of integrity can make a difference. For so many, he was that difference, including at the dedication of the Holocaust Memorial Museum in 1993 when he urged me to stop the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia,” President Bill Clinton said Saturday. Elie Weisel’s son, Elisha, said the author and activist inspired people to make a difference. ”My father raised his voice to presidents and prime ministers when he felt issues on the world stage demanded action,” Elisha Wiesel said. ”But those who knew him in private life had the pleasure of experiencing a gentle and devout man who was always interested in others, and whose quiet voice moved them to better themselves.” He wanted peace,   When he returned to the site of the Buchenwald death camp in 2009, he advocated for peace in the Middle East while addressing President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He lamented there was no grave of his father to visit and said the hope of no more war that he felt upon his rescue in 1945 was damaged. ”What can I tell him?” he asked. ”That the world has learned? I am not so sure.” He implored Obama to help bring peace to the world. ”The time must come. It’s enough    enough to go to cemeteries, enough to weep for oceans. It’s enough,” he said. ”There must come a moment    a moment of bringing people together.” Wiesel defended the cause of Soviet Jews, Nicaragua’s Miskito Indians,   Israeli youth, Argentina’s ”Disappeared,” Cambodian refugees, the Kurds, and victims of famine and genocide in Africa, apartheid in South Africa and war in the former Yugoslavia, according to the website of the Elie Wiesel Foundation, which he and Marion founded in 1986. The family said the funeral will be private but there will be a public memorial, though that has yet to be scheduled. Did you meet the Nobel laureate?

Pakistani Woman Accused Of Forcing Daughter Into Prostitution To Finance Pilgrimage to Mecca,"Dubai police have been investigating claims that a Pakistani woman forced her    daughter into prostitution to finance her family’s travel expenses for the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. [The victim, who is now residing in a trafficking shelter, told police she was asked by her parents to travel to the UAE and upon arrival realized the job she was promised in “a beauty parlor” was in fact prostitution.  She said she eventually acceded to her mother’s request, done at the behest of her father, “out of fear and in order to finance her grandparents’ pilgrimage and medical expenses. ” The suspect, the victim’s mother, admitted to the charges. She said she arrived in the UAE six months prior to work as a housekeeper, and that she borrowed money from a local man she was unable to pay back. To pay off the debt, he suggested that he have sex with the debtor’s daughter, which he did along with a friend. The suspect said she later suggested a similar deal to other men. The woman and her husband were charged with trafficking by the Dubai Criminal Court. Meanwhile, Sweden and Turkey were on a collision course after the Swedish Foreign Minister said on Twitter that Ankara ignores sexual exploitation of minors by allowing children under 15 to have sex. “Turkish decision to allow sex with children under 15 must be reversed. Children need more protection, not less, against violence, sex abuse,” the minister wrote. The Turkish foreign ministry summoned the first secretary of the Swedish embassy in Ankara, expressing their profound disappointment at the “falsehoods” his minister divulged. Turkey’s Foreign Minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, issued a statement criticizing his Swedish counterpart. “A foreign minister should not tell lies and should not adopt an approach accusing Turkey,” Cavusoglu said. “Yes to criticism but this is slander, a lie. ” Turkey’s top constitutional court in July annulled a provision punishing as “sexual abuse” all sexual acts involving children under the age of 15, responding to a petition brought by a lower court. The court has given a   period for parliament to pass such a law. The lower court that brought the petition was worried there was no distinction between cases of sexual acts involving a young teenager or a toddler. Cavusoglu said the Turkish government was determined to fight child abuse and added the justice ministry was currently working on new rules. In a war of words with Stockholm on Twitter, Turkey’s Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek told Wallström: “You are clearly misinformed. There is no such stupid thing in Turkey. Please get your facts right. ”"
These cities are most by US recession,"’  ’ ’   In times of recession, some cities are hit much harder than   others. ’ ”   A  published in the Journal of   Urban Economics takes a close look at the uneven effects of   the past several business cycles, including the Great Recession,   on America’s metros. ” ”   To do so, it tracks monthly economic activity for the nation’s 50   largest metros over the course of several recessions between 1990   and 2015, charting their effects on economic output,   productivity, wages, and unemployment. ” ”   Some recessions are weaker than others, and their effects vary by   geography. Slightly more than half of large metros (26 out of 50)   experienced a recession during the national recession in the   early ’90s. Rustbelt metros like Detroit and Cleveland,     by deindustrialization and the contraction of the manufacturing   industry, faced long and deep recessions, as did   and     metros like Miami, Tampa, and Orlando. ” ”   Coastal metros like New York, Boston, Washington, D. C. and L. A.   as well as Riverside, Providence, and Hartford, also experienced   significant recessions in the early ’90s. By contrast, western   metros like Seattle, Denver, Portland, San Antonio, Austin, and   Salt Lake City managed positive   because their   housing prices remained relatively low and they were in the midst   of developing   and   economies. ” ’   The recession of the early 2000s was largely about the tech boom   and the   bubble. As a result, it clobbered   hubs   like San Francisco, Denver, Portland, San Jose, and Austin. But   this recession again hit hard at   Rustbelt   metros like Detroit and Cleveland and Sunbelt metros, whose   economies were more exposed to the downturn in housing.   Meanwhile, the Washington, D. C. and Virginia Beach metro areas   saw positive economic growth during this time, perhaps buoyed by   federal spending. ’ ’  ’ ’   That brings us to the ”Great Recession” in the late 2000s. This   recession hit a whopping 49 out of the country’’s 50 largest   metros, sparing only Oklahoma City. ’ ’   The metros that suffered the most were devastated by the housing     mainly Rustbelt metros like Detroit and sprawling   Sunbelt metros like Miami, Las Vegas, Tampa, Orlando, and   Jacksonville. Meanwhile, a combination of   metros   (like Oklahoma City) and knowledge hubs like Austin and Denver   were less   by the Great Recession. ’ ’   The chart below sums up all three periods of national recession   from 1990 to 2015, with each bar representing the severity of   these recessions for a given metro. Overall, business cycles   appear to hit the hardest in   Rustbelt   metros like Detroit and Sunbelt metros like Miami and Las Vegas.   That said, San Jose has also been   especially by the   2001 tech crash. ’ ’  ’ ’   The most interesting part of the study takes a close look at the   factors that expose or protect metros from the effects of a   business cycle. ’ ’   Two things seem to matter most: First, the study echoes a wide   body of research that identifies the effects of human capital,   talent, or a highly educated workforce on economic growth and   development. Here, the study finds that   metros   suffer from more severe recessions, most likely because their   workers have a tougher time finding or keeping jobs during a   period of economic decline. ’ ’   Second, metro economies that are more dependent on housing (or   have ”lower housing price elasticities,” in economic terms) are   also more vulnerable to recession. These metros are also far more   vulnerable to swings in housing prices. ’ ’   What’’s more, the study finds that metros are affected by what   happens to nearby and adjacent metros. In this way, the effects   of economic cycles tend to ”spill over” from one metro to   another. On the one hand, the study finds, Northeast and upper   Midwest metros like New York, Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore,   Pittsburgh, Columbus, Hartford, and Buffalo are weighed down   economically by their adjacent metros. On the other, places like   Washington, D. C. Austin, and Providence are strong enough to   weather a recession on their own. ’ ’   Ultimately, the study boils down to a few main takeaways. For   one,   and   economies are the best defense   against severe recessions, while   Rustbelt   metros and   or   Sunbelt metros are   much more exposed to the ups and downs of the business cycle.   Still,   economies are not immune: They, too, can get   hurt when the tech economy becomes overheated and tech bubbles   burst. ’ ’   In the end, the study reinforces our understanding of the U. S.   economy that has emerged over the past 15 years: The divide   between   metro economies and everywhere else only   continues to deepen. ’ ’In times of recession, some cities are hit much. ..’"
"Texas Restaurateur Accused of Harboring, Arming Illegal Aliens","REFUGIO, Texas  —   A local restaurateur has been charged with human smuggling after allegedly using his business to hide illegal aliens and providing them with firearms. [Federal agents with the help of local police raided two local restaurants and two mobile homes where they arrested 16 illegal aliens and found multiple firearms. At one of the restaurants, Taqueria Guadalajara, agents arrested Alfredo Plascencia Leon five illegal immigrants from Mexico and one from Honduras who were working at the restaurant. The other raids took place at the properties behind the store and at a second restaurant, Gumbo Seafood, owned and operated by Plascencia. Refugio is approximately 44 miles from Corpus Christi.   Court records obtained by Breitbart Texas revealed that Plascencia would allegedly house illegal aliens in various mobile homes and collected rent.  During the raids, authorities seized an “assault rifle” a shotgun, a . 45 caliber pistol, and a . 22 caliber rifle. Mario Rizo Melendez, one of the illegal aliens, told authorities that the . 22 caliber weapon was given to him by Plascencia and that the shotgun was loaned to him also.  Breitbart Texas reached out to Gregory Palmore, a spokesman for U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who stated that the raid was part of a   criminal investigation and not an immigration action, as some local outlets incorrectly reported.

Newt Gingrich: NRA-Trump Alliance Eroding Democrats’ Hold on Rural America,"Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich observes that the alliance between the National Rifle Association (NRA) and Donald Trump is eroding the Democrats’ hold on rural America. [The NRA not only endorsed Trump on May 20, but has reaffirmed its commitment to him time and again in the months since. Most recently, on August 10, CNN reported  ’s executive director, Chris Cox, stressed that Trump is “the Second Amendment candidate we need. ” Also, on August 10, The New York Times highlighted that the NRA is standing strong with Trump.  Gingrich sees this alliance as a winner inasmuch as it brings highly active, grassroots Second Amendment supporters to the Trump campaign. When combined with Trump’s appeal to the working man, it deals a death blow to the Democratic Party’s grip on rural America. According to The Hill, Gingrich said, “It’s probably the single most reliable base of votes, and it’s one of the reasons that in rural America you now see the virtual collapse of the Democratic Party. ” Both the NRA and Trump continue to stress that a Hillary Clinton presidency will mark the end of Second Amendment freedoms. The NRA stresses that giving Clinton the ability to nominate Supreme Court justices is tantamount to giving her the power to redefine —  or completely erase —  gun rights, while Trump continually stresses that Clinton wants to “abolish the Second Amendment. ” On August 9, Trump said, “Hillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish, the Second Amendment. ” He echoed the NRA by stressing that she will use the Supreme Court to do it. Trump made clear that he will take a different road, selecting Supreme Court justices like Antonin Scalia and pledging to work with the NRA to do so. Trump is a lifetime member of the NRA. Clinton has declared war on the NRA. AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio. Follow him on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.

Former Trump adviser at center of Russia firestorm wrote letter to DOJ accusing ’Clinton regime’ of committing ’hate crimes’ against him,"’  ’ ’   Carter Page, an early   adviser to Donald   Trump’’s presidential campaign, wrote a letter to the Department   of Justice on February 12 alleging Hillary Clinton’’s campaign   committed ”human rights abuses” and ”hate crimes” against him   during the 2016 election. ’ ’   ”The actions by the Clinton regime and their associates may   be among the most extreme examples of human rights violations   observed during any election in US history since Dr. Martin   Luther King, Jr. was similarly targeted for his   views in   the 1960s,” Page wrote in a letter addressed to ”Members of the   Civil Rights Division’s Voting Section” of the Department of   Justice.  ’ ’   That   ’ ’   Page shared the letter with Business Insider in response to   inquiries about his relationship with Attorney General Jeff   Sessions, who reports have suggested steered  in early 2016. ’ ’   Page did not respond to questions about his ties with Sessions,   calling them ”insane.” He instead pointed Business   Insider to his  ’ ”An unverified   dossier about Trump’s ties to Russia, written by former   British spy Christopher Steele at the request of     Republicans, named Page as a liaison between the Trump   campaign and Russian officials. ” ”   US intelligence officials briefed Trump on the dossier’s contents   in early January, and the FBI  to continue his   investigation after Republicans  —   and, later, Democrats  —   stopped   funding Steele’s research. ” ’   Page, who worked athas strongly denied the   accusation that he served as a middleman between Trump’’s   campaign and Russia. He called such claims an ”illegal” form   of ”retribution” for a speech he gave in Moscow at the New   Economic School last July, in which he slammed the US for   its  ’ ’    ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ”I am a lifelong practicing Roman Catholic who attended Catholic   schools for 14 years, culminating with my Master of Arts in   National Security Studies from Georgetown University in 1994,”   Carter wrote. ”The clear evidence of intolerance against   Catholics shown by the ’’Hillary for America’’ campaign and the   fact that several of her closest advisors knew of my religion   helps to make part of the reason for her attacks more obvious.” ’ ’   Carter concluded that he still ”remains a believer in the   principles” of his religion ”despite the harsh repression that I   have endured from the Clinton campaign.” ’ ’   Page also alleged that the Clinton campaign discriminated against   him because he is male. ’ ’   ”Although the advancement of women’s rights is essential, Mrs.   Clinton has shown further evidence of discrimination on this   basis as well last year. Although seen throughout her campaign,   it was demonstrated most recently with her ’’The future is female’’   speech last week.” ’ ’   ”For these reasons and in summary, it is essential that a full   investigation of the crimes committed against me by the Clinton   campaign and their associates should be initiated immediately,”   Page wrote, arguing that the lack of a full investigation into   Clinton’’s ”human rights abuses” against him ”could have a   negative impact on the future arc of US national   security.”   ’ ”   The Clinton campaign and the Justice Department didn’t respond to   requests for comment. ” ”   You can read Page’s full letter below: ” ’ ’ ’     ’ ’Carter Page, an early   adviser. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’"
French Foreign Minister: Assad’s Denials of Chemical Attack ’100 per cent Lies’,"(AFP)  —   Syrian President Bashar  ’s comments that last week’s chemical weapons attack was a fabrication to justify a US military strike are “100 percent lies” French Foreign Minister   Ayrault said Friday. [“It’s 100 percent lies and propaganda,” Ayrault said during a visit to Beijing, responding to an exclusive AFP interview with Assad on Wednesday.  “It’s 100 percent cruelty and cynicism. ” The French minister mirrored language used by Assad himself, who dismissed the allegation that his regime perpetrated the attack that left 87 civilians dead, including many children. “Definitely, 100 percent for us, it’s fabrication,” Assad said in the interview. The Syrian leader questioned whether the attack had in fact occurred, claiming that “fake videos” and “propaganda” were being used against his government. He also accused the United States of colluding with terrorists and “fabricating the whole story in order to have a pretext” for a cruise missile strike on a Syrian air base last week. The French minister made the remarks during a joint press conference with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. “The reality is that more than 300, 000 have died, 11 million people have been displaced or become refugees, tens of thousands have been placed in Syrian prisons and a country has been destroyed,” Ayrault said. “That is the reality. It is not a fantasy. ” He emphasised the need for an end to the conflict with a “real ceasefire, one which restricts the Syrian air force and military and is upheld by the international community. ” Ayrault praised China’s role in the matter, noting its abstention from a United Nations Security Council vote on a resolution to condemn the Syrian gas attack. In the past, China has voted alongside Russia to veto UN resolutions on the Syrian conflict. Wang expressed his agreement with the French minister, noting that an “independent, fair and professional investigation” into the chemical weapons attack should be conducted “as soon as possible. ”"
Set to die: Does mental competence matter? ," (CNN) Six of the eight men Arkansas planned to execute over an   period this month are not mentally fit for the death penalty, a report by a Harvard Law School initiative suggests. The report by the school’s Fair Punishment Project says that between mental illnesses, intellectual disabilities and ”bad lawyering,” the orders for all eight of the executions may never have been justified. ”Nobody is questioning whether people who commit some of the most serious offenses should be held accountable,” said Rob Smith, executive director of the project, which seeks to create a fair and accountable justice system. ”The question is, do people who are among the most broken, vulnerable and impaired in our society deserve the death penalty,” he said, as opposed to life without parole.  A flurry of   court rulings and appeals raised doubts whether Arkansas would be able to execute any of the men this month as planned. But late Thursday night, the first of the eight, Ledell Lee, was put to the death.  Of the inmates originally scheduled to die, one has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, another has suffered with hallucinations, two have IQ levels indicative of intellectual impairment, and most have experienced severe abuse, according to the Fair Punishment Project’s report. Each has been convicted of murder, and most have been on death row for a couple of decades.  The lethal injections were set to begin April 17 and continue through April 27 in a rash of executions unlike anything seen since states reinstituted the death penalty in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.  Until Thursday night, Arkansas hadn’t put someone to death since 2005, so why the sudden rush?  The state’s supply of midazolam, a controversial drug meant to sedate inmates during lethal injections, will expire at the end of April. And Gov. Asa Hutchinson said in an earlier statement to CNN it is his ”duty” to ”carry out these lawful sentences imposed by juries and upheld by the Arkansas Supreme Court” before it’s too late. The Eighth Amendment ”bans cruel and unusual punishment,” said Jeffrey Toobin, CNN’s senior legal analyst. ”Part of the issue of who can be executed is whether they can understand why they’re being executed. . .. If you don’t understand why you’re being punished, the death penalty doesn’t serve the purpose it’s supposed to serve.” While ”the vast majority of those on death row are poor and ignorant and mentally damaged in one way or another,” Toobin said, ”the general rule is mental illness does not get you out of being executed only mental retardation does. But the lines around those conditions are not extremely clear.” In its report, the Fair Punishment Project outlined the histories of each of the eight men who had been scheduled to die this month. The report was based on court pleadings and opinions, transcripts of expert testimonies, and witness affidavits. Here’s a summary of the report’s findings: • Don Davis was supposed to be put to death April 17 and had been served his last meal before the US Supreme Court refused to overrule a state court ruling    thereby delaying his execution. On two IQ tests he took as a child, Davis scored a 69 and a 77, signaling intellectual impairment, court documents show. He also suffered a serious head injury and, coupled with his low IQ level and   hyperactivity disorder, experiences ” ’double deficits’ in cognitive functioning,” the report states. Soon after his birth, both his parents abandoned him. Davis ”never received a comprehensive mental health evaluation by an independent expert,” the report found. He has spent more than 25 years on death row.  • Serious mental illnesses have plagued Jack Jones since childhood, the project’s review of documents showed. He endured paralyzing hallucinations and, at times, would be found rocking and banging his head against cupboards. He was abused by his father and abducted and raped by three strangers. He attempted suicide twice before he finally got psychiatric attention. He committed himself to a hospital for severe depression and suicidal ideation just months before he committed murder    and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder not long before his crime. The jury heard ”almost none of this,” the report states. Jones was scheduled to die April 24.  • Marcel Williams’ first experience with sexual abuse was when his mother offered him up to a friend when he was just 9 or 10, legal documents show. Starting at 12, his ”’mother was routinely pimping him . .. in exchange for food stamps, for food, for a place to stay’” to women 10, 20,   years older than him, the report quotes. He was   while in an adult prison where he served time as an adolescent. He was beaten severely and regularly by his mother, who once burned him with an electric coil. He was raised in abject poverty and didn’t always have shoes. A judge reversed his death sentence because Williams’ history wasn’t presented to a jury, but an appellate court reinstated the sentence. Williams also was set to die April 24. • Kenneth Williams has an IQ of 70, a history of ”neuropsychological problems” and ”severe learning disabilities,” testimonies showed. He bounced between six foster homes and often wasn’t adequately fed. His own parents abused drugs, and he endured physical abuse. Evidence suggests that he’s suffered brain damage, having exhibited a tremor, deficient motor skills and problems with memory. He has trouble focusing or comprehending what he reads or hears and has shown deficiencies when it comes to reasoning and judgment. He began smoking marijuana at 6 and turned to beer by 9    the same age he was when he was first institutionalized in the juvenile system. He was set to die April 27.  • The review of records for Ledell Lee and Stacey Johnson show inadequate legal representation, the report found. In the case of Johnson, whose conviction was based in part on the inconsistent testimony of a    girl, there remain questions about his guilt, the report said. And no evidence exists that Johnson’s lawyers ever looked at his life history. On Wednesday, the Arkansas Supreme Court issued a stay of Johnson’s execution, allowing for further DNA testing that might prove his innocence. He had been scheduled to die Thursday.  A claim that Lee was intellectually disabled was introduced at one point, the report showed, but the federal defender who introduced that was removed from the case.  A brief filed Wednesday on Lee’s behalf by a new legal team argued for clemency and requested DNA testing. The brief stated that Lee had ”serious neuropsychological deficits stemming from Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder,” showed ”evidence of possible brain damage resulting from a boxing injury as a child” and likely had ”either borderline or mild intellectual disability.”  • Jason McGehee was scheduled to be executed April 27 but was granted a temporary stay of execution April 6. McGehee’s mental fitness wasn’t a factor instead, a clemency recommendation by the parole board based on good behavior prompted the stay. But the Fair Punishment Project’s report found that McGehee has bipolar disorder, which went untreated when he was a child, and has shown evidence of brain damage and frontal lobe impairments. He was abused by his father, his mother and later his stepfather    who kicked McGehee’s dog to death while forcing McGehee to watch. ”Jason was never the same after that,” his aunt said in a court petition, though none of this was presented during his trial. • On April 14, the Arkansas Supreme Court granted a stay of execution for Bruce Ward, who had been scheduled to die April 17.  According to the Fair Punishment Project report, he didn’t understand what was coming. He believed he was about to set off on a ”special mission as an evangelist,” according to a complaint cited in the report. He told a forensic psychiatrist in 2010 he hears voices, he gets revelations directly from God and he will ”walk out of prison to great riches and public acclaim.” He said he’s been visited in prison by his deceased father and ”resurrected dogs.” It’s believed that mental illness runs in Ward’s family. He was 4 when his mother had a mental breakdown. She beat him regularly, put tar on him before submerging him in   water and forced him as a young boy to sleep naked beneath water that dripped through a leaking roof.  ”We are grateful that the Arkansas Supreme Court has issued a stay of execution for Bruce Ward so that they may consider the serious questions presented about his sanity,” Ward’s attorney, Scott Braden, said in a statement last week. ”His nearly three decades in solitary confinement have only worsened his severe mental illness.”  "
Islamic State Guide for Lone Wolf Jihadis: ’Act Christian’,"Islamic State jihadists have released a publication that teaches jihadis how to blend into Western society, acting “Christian” and avoiding mosques, while building terror cells. [The release of this guide follows that of an   filled with tips for young folks who need to tell Mom and Dad they have decided to abandon Western life and run off to join the savage caliphate in Syria.  The book is a   work from the “  Media Center,” composed by Abu Ubayda Abdullah   with the clunky title Safety  Security Guidelines for Lone Wolf Mujahadeen and Small Cells.   The cover illustration is much snappier than the title, depicting the skyline of New York in flames after a devastating attack. The image certainly should be   because it was designed by a   Hollywood marketing team —  it was stolen from the poster for the 2008 movie Cloverfield. The devastating attack on New York that ISIS wants readers to drool over was carried out by a    monster with a short temper and carnivorous dandruff. It was the ultimate   jihadi, although it looked more like a lone bat. Looking past the stolen cover art, the new ISIS publication advises lone wolves to set up small cells with four or five members, avoiding communication between cells to make it harder for Western police forces to round them up. (In other words, they are telling “lone wolves” to run in small packs.) The   attackers are cited as an example of compartmentalizing information within a cell effectively. If the cops do pick up a cell leader’s scent, the guide advises them to head for the front lines in Afghanistan or Iraq or liquidate themselves in a “martyrdom operation” (i. e. suicide attack) taking their secrets with them. “  jihadis are urged to remain vigilant at all times by paying attention to the news and internet to know what is happening locally and abroad,” News. com writes. “They are also instructed to analyse the actions of failed jihadis to avoid making the same mistakes, and to keep updated on interrogation techniques. ” Much advice focuses on how to blend into Western culture and look inconspicuous until the time for carrying out attacks is right. Lone wolves are encouraged to cut off their beards, avoid using Islamic phrases, avoid mosques that might be under police surveillance, dress in modest Western clothing, and steer clear of food and even perfume that might give them away as Muslims. The discerning jihadi is warned that intelligence agencies like the American CIA know how to check the garbage of suspected militants to find Arab food, and if a beard is not shaved off early enough to allow time for proper sun tanning, wily intelligence agents are likely to notice the recent removal of facial hair. The guide goes so far as to advise jihadis to pretend they are Christians. “It is permissible in such cases for you to wear a necklace showing a Christian cross,” explains one passage, quoted by Heavy. com. “As you know, Christians (or even atheist Westerners with Christian background) wear crosses on their necklaces. But don’t wear a cross necklace if you have a Muslim name on your passport, as that may look strange. ” The UK Sun notes that the “new” handbook is actually an old   field manual, updated by their degenerate successors in ISIS. Besides the colorful advice on blending into Western society, the book includes some hard information about using encrypted   applications, how to communicate online without being detected, how to prepare a safe house, and how to detect spies attempting to infiltrate a terrorist cell. Terrorism expert Neil Doyle is quoted by the Sun saying there have been “hundreds of downloads” of the new jihadi field guide already, with a number of Britons involved in distributing it, including “Supermarket Jihadi” Omar Hussein, author of the   pamphlet instructing children how to prepare for the sacred journey to the caliphate."
2 women charged with murder in Kim Jong Nam’s death,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) Two women accused of killing the estranged half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un were charged with murder Wednesday.  Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong both said they were not guilty in the killing of Kim Jong Nam, who died suddenly February 13 in Malaysia.   Police said they killed Kim by smearing VX, a deadly nerve agent, on his face while he was waiting to catch a flight at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.  If found guilty, they will face the death penalty, according to charge sheets read in court Wednesday. The women have not entered formal pleas, which will take place when the case reaches the High Court.  Wearing a red   and appearing to be on the verge of tears, Aisyah, an Indonesian citizen, was led to the dock in handcuffs.  ”I do not admit this,” she said when an interpreter asked her whether she understood the charges, before repeating, ”I am not guilty of this.”  Huong, a Vietnamese who was photographed after the crime wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned with the letters ”LOL,” also said she was ”not guilty” of murder.  According to authorities from their home countries, both women have maintained they thought they were participating in a TV prank show.  The charge sheet also mentioned ”four others at large” who took part in the crime. Malaysian officials have previously named four North Koreans as suspects, with another three wanted for questioning.  Suspect thought she was using baby oil, Aisyah thought the substance she rubbed on Kim’s face was ”a kind of oil, baby oil, something like that,” said Andreano Erwin, Indonesia’s deputy ambassador to Malaysia. Malaysian authorities said the substance was VX nerve agent, a deadly chemical weapon banned under international law. After the women wiped Kim’s face with the liquid, he started feeling dizzy and died shortly afterward on his way to the hospital, Malaysian police said. Footage obtained by CNN showed Aisyah celebrating her 25th birthday at a restaurant in Kuala Lumpur the night before the killing.  ”And now the person next to me will become a (celebrity),” one friend is heard saying in the video, prompting Aisyah to laugh.  Speaking to CNN in Serang, in Indonesia’s Banten province, Aisyah’s aunt, Darmi, said her niece had been hired ”to work as a comedian,” pranking strangers by putting lotion and tomato sauce on them. ”It would be impossible for such a tiny person like her to do such a crime if she was not manipulated,” she said.  A friend who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity agreed, saying that Aisyah was ”naive” and easily ”manipulated.”  ”Whatever that people said, she would believe. She would only follow,” the friend said. Erwin, the Indonesian diplomat, said outside court Wednesday that he had met with Aisyah and she was ”not alone.”  ”Indonesia will always be with her,” he said.  North Korea calls allegations ’smear campaign’ South Korean lawmakers, briefed by the country’s intelligence officials, said two North Korean ministries orchestrated the plot to kill Kim on the orders of his half brother.  ”The assassination of Kim Jong Nam was an act of systematic terror ordered by Kim Jong Un,” South Korean lawmaker Kim   said in a televised address. ”The operation was conducted with two assassination groups and one supporting group.” But North Korea furiously denied the allegations in an article posted Wednesday by the   Korean Central News Agency.  ”The US and South Korean authorities are groundlessly blaming the DPRK . ..,” the article said, using the acronym for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. ”Almost all countries have scrapped chemical weapons under the convention on ban on chemical weapons but only the US and some other countries still possess (them),” the article said. North Korea also suggested the United States had given the nerve agent to South Korea and accused both countries of starting a ”  smear campaign.” ”The US and its vassal forces should not run amuck, clearly understanding the strategic position of the DPRK as a nuclear power,” the article said."

’Avengers: Age of Ultron’: Film review," (CNN) The powers of Marvel’s   superheroes go a bit wobbly in ”Avengers: Age of Ultron.” Faced with the daunting prospect of topping the surprise and excitement of 2012’s The Avengers, the third   film of all time,   Joss Whedon mixes some brooding   in with the abundant spectacle. To be sure, series junkies will get their fix from the sheer massiveness of the exploits, but at least two of the big action scenes are lackluster, while the climax and resolution could have been worked out in more complex, less rote ways, so as to further increase intrigue and anticipation for ”Avengers: Infinity War Parts 1 and 2,” already scheduled for release in May of 2018 and 2019, respectively. Not that any of this will matter much, since the   excitement among the enormous international fan base is so intense that nothing will keep the summer’s presumed biggest franchise blockbuster from soaring to and beyond the   dollar threshold internationally.   producer Kevin Feige and his associates have built a cinematic empire quite unprecedented in Hollywood history, a veritable solar system of staggeringly profitable individual franchises unified by the overpowering collective force of the Avengers. So while sideline enterprises like the new ”Daredevil” TV series continue to pop up, the company can be so confident in the enduring appeal of its theatrical mainstays that it recently published a release schedule for its remaining   commercial titles from now through the end of the decade. At this point, no one would be willing to bet on when a sense of terminal deja vu might set in to bring it all to an end, and   can plan its main events years ahead. In the meantime, the key points of interest surround how many surprises and twists can be wrung from a format and set of expectations that demand great fealty from core fans any significant deviations are taken as personal betrayals by the   geeks. Last summer, ”Guardians of the Galaxy” showed that Marvel could play it a bit more fast and loose than it generally does, but the   franchises still seem sacrosanct. And so it is with ”Avengers: Age of Ultron,” which at moments takes a peek down some shadowy side roads but ends up mostly zooming along the main highway to deliver what the audience wants rather than something even a little bit different. Picking up where last year’s ”Captain America: Winter Soldier” left off, the new film, without preamble, dives right in to show the Avengers dispatching the remnants of the nasty HYDRA organization in a hectically and indifferently staged forest combat scene that leaves Clint   (Jeremy Renner) worse for wear while also introducing two new adversaries, twins Pietro and Wanda (  Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen). Victory allows for some passably amusing scenes of the heroes blowing off steam: The favorite party trick of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is to challenge all comers to lift up his hammer   Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Bruce   Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) pursue a little mating dance in which her amorous interest is predicated upon his retaining his human rather than superhero form and Tony   Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Steve   America (Chris Evans) take stock of the advances their old Nazi nemesis Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann) appears to be making in the artificial intelligence department, specifically with the most sophisticated humanoid ever devised, Ultron (voiced with marvelous robotic nuance by James Spader). What’s behind Warner Bros.’ risky move to release nine movies, Ultron is a cool and sophisticated creation what he lacks, of course, is a heart, which is what makes him such an imposing villain. A sleekly designed robot you might even call handsome, he makes an excellent intellectual and   sparring partner for Stark, but when he first appears, he’s still on training wheels. However, he does recruit Pietro and Wanda to his cause, an easy matter since Stark killed their parents. He’s not yet entirely ready to conquer the universe but, in their first skirmish with him, the Avengers are sufficiently outclassed to begin worrying. Could ’Star Wars’ open at $500 million? Licking their wounds at the ”safe house” of Hawkeye’s farm, the Avengers go into a funk. The impatient Thor quickly takes off ”to find answers,” Bruce resists Natasha’s desire to get something physical cooking between them Stark, lamenting that ”Ultron is tryng to tear us apart,” consults with old cohort Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson, briefly) while Mad Men’s Linda Cardellini, playing Hawkeye’s     wife, is stuck with the (intentionally?) funniest line of dialogue in the film: ”You know I totally support your avenging.” While some of his partners wallow in disarray, Captain America heads for Seoul, where the next evolutionary step is to emerge via a device called ”the cradle,” which will hatch   android soldiers that will pave the way for Ultron’s world domination. But a major chase through the city involving a runaway subway train falls flat due to basic conceptual silliness and poor action continuity. Of course, the Avengers ultimately get it together to do the kind of   they’re supposed to do, and a very welcome addition to the team comes in the form of the android called Vision.   and   Vision is given a striking profile and overall presence by Paul Bettany (heretofore limited in the Marvel world to vocal work as Stark’s computerized butler J. A. R. V. I. S.) and it can be hoped, if not assumed, that this most intriguing character will play an even more important role in the final two Avengers installments. ’Galaxy Quest’ TV series in the works, Ultimately, Whedon’s efforts to invest the heroes with a degree of uncertainty and vulnerability comes off as   as such an effort can only go so far due to the nature of the material. After all, these are comic book characters defined by their double identities a third dimension is neither required nor perhaps even desired.  If ending on a dramatic cliffhanger note had been desired, the elements were there for the taking including a   component along with mystery about Ultron’s ultimate fate would arguably have only further cranked up anticipation for the coming chapters. But, then, what does that matter when the automatic attendance of millions is assured? ”Avengers: Age of Ultron” succeeds in the top priority of creating a worthy opponent for its superheroes and giving the latter a few new things to do, but this time the action scenes don’t always measure up and some of the characters are left in a kind of dramatic  ’ . The returning series actors acquit themselves in the expected agreeable manner, while series newcomer Andy Serkis has a terrific couple of minutes as a tough but stressed South African criminal."
Burrowing Under Luminous Ice to Retrieve Mussels - The New York Times,"KANGIQSUJUAQ, Quebec  —   For eight months a year, the flat bay around the village of Kangiqsujuaq in far northern Quebec freezes beneath a white expanse of ice and snow, leaving ravens and foxes as rare signs of life, along with Inuit and their dogs. Throughout the winter the Inuit hunt seal and caribou, and they fish through the ice for arctic char. But in the coldest months, when the ice is thickest, some venture beneath the ice to gather mussels. Every two weeks the pull of the moon combines with the geography of this region to create unusually large tides. The water falls as much as 55 feet in some places, emptying the bay under the ice along the shore for an hour or more. That’s when some Inuit climb aboard their snowmobiles and head out onto the bay. Watch a 360 video of the mussel collecting mission. One recent day I joined two of them, Tiisi Qisiiq, 51, and Adami Alaku, 61, who identified a void and chopped a hole into the ice. Underneath is a beautiful, eerie world of bending ice, glowing blue from the sunlight outside. The sound of trickling water fills the humid,   air. On my recent trip it was 20 degrees below zero (minus 29 degrees Celsius) but a balmy 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius) beneath the ice. The men lowered themselves through the hole to the bay floor. The ground was covered with kelp, the occasional crab and edible clumps of roe from the fourhorn sculpin, which the Inuit call the ugly fish. But Mr. Qisiiq and Mr. Alaku came for fat blue mussels that cling to the rocks. Using lamps to light the way, they pulled the frigid mussels free with their hands. Before long, the sound of ticks and pops signaled the returning tide as it lifted the ice on the bay. Soon, the water would fill the caverns. The flood tide is deceiving, starting slowly until it rises more than a foot (30 centimeters) a minute. The men headed for the hole and climbed out into the clear, cold air. I first heard of mussel gathering under the ice when I lived in Shanghai and my son was given a children’s book called “Very Last First Time,” by the Canadian author Jan Andrews. It tells the enchanting tale of an Inuit girl’s first time under the ice alone. Ever since, I’ve wanted to go under the ice myself. Now I have, and I saw the bay floor’s bounty brought to the surface. The book’s drawings depict a colorful, cavernous space beneath the ice, far different from the cramped and narrow confines that I discovered. The colder the winter, the thicker and more stable the ice and the larger the spaces left by the ebbing tide. Mr. Qisiiq’s mentor, Lukasi Nappaaluk, remembers gathering mussels as a child in caverns of ice with ceilings 20 feet high. But global warming is making the ice less predictable and more prone to buckling. Warm water currents thin the ice from below, making the snowmobile crossings increasingly dangerous. The mussels are a welcome winter treat these days, but at one time they were a lifesaving source of food during the lean frozen months. Raw meat, with its abundance of vitamins, has allowed the Inuit to live for centuries on a diet almost devoid of fruits and vegetables. The only preparation for the mussels is pulling off their beards, the strings of protein that mussels make to cling to rocks, and then rinsing them. The Inuit still eat a lot of “country food,” caribou and seal and whale and fish that they prefer to eat raw while sitting on the floor. Mussels are no exception. Mr. Qisiiq and his wife, Siasi Qisiiq, shucked the bivalves using the edge of a shell. They scraped out the meat and squeezed it in their fist, wringing out the salty seawater, before eating them as is. Ms. Qisiiq boiled some of the mussels for me. They were rich and meaty, salty with no seasoning, and steaming  —   welcome warmth after hours outside. I had some of the raw mussels, too, still chilled from the bay. They tasted a lot like raw oysters, but with a bitter finish. I would prefer them marinara style."
Teachers to Wear Black Lives Matter Shirts to Class to Protest ’Systemic Oppression’,"Teachers at a Washington state elementary school plan to wear Black Lives Matter shirts in class Friday to protest “systemic oppression. ”[Teacher Jennifer Whitney came up with the idea to make   that read, “Black Lives Matter: We Stand Together” with the school’s name, John Muir Elementary, on the bottom, KING 5 reported.  Whitney said she wanted to promote discussions about race, particularly with high incarceration rates and low college graduation rates among people of color. “It is part of the oppression, the systemic oppression that continues on,” Whitney told KING 5.   teacher Marjorie Lamarre said that being silent on Black Lives Matter would be “unforgivable. ” “To be silent would be almost unforgivable, and I think we have been silent for almost too long,” Lamarre said. Donations paid for the shirts, which will be worn on Friday, September 16. When KING 5 reached out for comment, a spokesperson for Seattle Public Schools said they support what teachers are doing at the elementary school. “We are united in our collective commitment to eliminating opportunity gaps,” the spokesperson said."
Roland Martin Defends Kaepernick - America Criticizes Black Voices for Demanding Freedom - Breitbart,"Friday on MSNBC, while discussing San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refusing to stand for the playing of the national anthem at his preseason football games, host of  TV One’s “News One Now” Roland Martin said, America has “criticized   forever for demanding to be free. ” and added, “What Colin Kaepernick is saying is if it requires me to take a knee or sit down to demand freedom, that’s what I’m going to do. ”  Partial transcript as follows: MARTIN: People are more concerned about what Colin Kaepernick is doing as opposed to why he is doing it. Do you understand that the San Francisco Police Department, they’ve been embroiled in a racist text message scandal. No one wants to talk about that, but his socks. Then you also have the people who don’t want to talk about the fact the police chief of San Francisco resigned in May because of another questionable shooting. Not that, but his socks. Let’s go to Oakland where they had three interim police chiefs in a matter two of weeks where they have a scandal, more than a dozen cops having sex with an underage prostitute. Again, not what Colin Kaepernick is talking about, but they want to talk about why he isn’t kneeling. That’s the problem in America. We never want to talk about the real issue as to why he’s protesting, it’s how he is doing it, and I love these people saying, ‘He should do it some other way,’  Jerry Rice, Drew Brees and others. It’s interesting. I haven’t heard them say what the other way is, so  …     MSNBC’s KATE SNOW:  Jerry Rice said  —   Jerry Rice says ‘All lives matter. So much going on in this world today. Can we all just get along? Colin, I respect your stance but don’t disrespect the flag.’ What does it say that a very popular, successful fellow   athlete is saying that? MARTIN:  That means Jerry Rice has no conscience. That means Jerry Rice tweeted something but he hasn’t put anything on the line. Jerry Rice has said nothing about racist text messages in San Francisco. Why doesn’t he join Aunjanue Ellis, a fellow native of Mississippi to talk about taking the confederate symbol off the flag. Drew Brees made his comment in New Orleans, has he stood with the mayor of New Orleans, Mitch Landrieu who called in the Department of Justice because of the corrupt police department there in New Orleans? See, that’s the whole point. I love these folks who are saying, oh, no, Colin, don’t do that, but they’ve been sitting their butts on the sidelines. They don’t mind us cheering them on the field. What about the issues off the field? Jerry Rice has been silent about that. And so Jerry, Colin has more guts on addressing these issues than you have, even with your hall of fame jacket. SNOW: I interviewed Harry Belafonte on your program this week. I want to play a little bit of sound that caught our ear from that interview. VIDEO CLIP, HARRY BELAFONTE: To mute the slave has always been to the best interests of the slave owner, and I think when a black voice is raised in protest to oppression, those who are comfortable with our oppression are the first to criticize us for daring to speak out against it. END VIDEO CLIP, SNOW:  How much of the outrage do you think is about respecting the flag and patriotism and how much of it is actually   racism? MARTIN: No, first of all, I think it’s a combination. I think Americans, we love to ignore what the real issue is. And so folks don’t want to deal with what he was speaking of. And that is police brutality. The need for social justice reform. You have more people who are outraged with Kaepernick as opposed to a judge allowing a man who sexually assaulted an    boy to get 30 days in prison because he felt prison would be too tough for him. Just get him some counseling. We have problems in our criminal justice system. Fans in Cleveland who are more excited about the Cavaliers winning a title as opposed to Tamir Rice  being shot and killed by a cop. We have the case in Chicago. again, everybody, ‘Oh, be quiet. Let’s be mad at Colin,’  but not the fact you have cops who covered up the incident of Laquan McDonald and we only know the truth because a videotape was released. Those are issues we have in this country. So America, for so many years, 397 years, has always objected from the moment   Africans arrived in 1619 at Port Comfort, Virginia, now Ft. Monroe, Virginia,  —   have always had a problem whenhave demanded freedom. What’s interesting, they criticized Dr. King for the very same thing. Muhammad Ali same thing. A. Philip Randolph and Fannie Lou Hammer, Ella Baker  —   they criticized African Americans forever for demanding to be free in America. What Colin Kaepernick is saying is if it requires me to take a knee or sit down to demand freedom, that’s what I’m going to do. I just want people to focus o black voices n those issues and not just whether or not he’s standing up for a national anthem or the flag. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN"
Alaskans Brace for Spending Cuts as Oil Prices Tumble - The New York Times,"The impact of falling oil prices in Alaska, which has seemed for many residents like a distant worry until now, is about to land. The turning point came on Friday, when the State House of Representatives, meeting at the Capitol in Juneau in the fifth special session since last summer, failed to override a   veto of the budget by Gov. Bill Walker. That means the $1. 3 billion in spending cuts imposed last month by Mr. Walker, a political independent, will almost certainly take effect on top of cuts that lawmakers in the   Legislature had already agreed on. And those effects will ripple far and wide across the state, from public schools and the University of Alaska, which will see steep declines in state aid to individual households, in the form of reduced state oil investment dividend checks to the state court system, which began closing at noon on Fridays to save money. Tiny airports that connect the state’s vast rural areas may have to close. Leaders in both parties said that positions were too entrenched and bitter to even bring up an override attempt to the floor, where it would have required a   supermajority to succeed, or to consider any of the taxes that Mr. Walker proposed to keep programs from being cut. Although the State Senate plans to continue meetings next week, the legal deadline for trying to roll back Mr. Walker’s dramatic   restructuring passed on Friday with the close of business. “Staying here for another 30 days is not going to resolve the revenue issues before us,” said Mike Chenault, the House Speaker, a Republican. Taxes paid by oil and gas companies, from the fields at Prudhoe Bay to Cook Inlet near Anchorage, make up about 90 percent of the state’s general fund revenues in Alaska, which has no statewide sales tax or income tax. But with the price of crude down by more than 50 percent from its high a few years ago, and production in   decline, those tax collections have dried up, exposing a deep dependence, and vulnerability. Anger is swirling, too. A petition drive has begun, seeking a ballot vote to recall Mr. Walker, a former Republican who was elected in 2014. Lawmakers in both parties could face voter anger in November, if only for being ineffectual in doing anything about the governor’s cuts. “I think it is likely that someone will file a lawsuit  —   highly likely,” said Senator Bill Wielechowski, a Democrat who said he thought Mr. Walker’s actions in unilaterally reducing dividend payments were illegal. “I’ve been getting calls from people who want to file a lawsuit, want to be a part of a lawsuit, people who have been around for a long long time, very well known politically in Alaska. ” In Mr. Walker’s veto, he also slashed tax credits that oil companies can get for exploration, which many Republicans objected to, saying it could hamper incentives to bring in new energy fields. But he also made some Democrats wince, in cutting education spending and the dividend fund paid to residents, which budget analysts at the University of Alaska said would hit poorer residents hardest because a state check is a bigger part of their income. Residents will still get a dividend from investment income earned by the state’s $54 billion Permanent Fund, but Mr. Walker ordered it capped at $1, 000 per person, down from just over $2, 000 last year. In Alaska  —   where many things, from food to energy, are expensive  —   the dividend has become entwined into the economic system. Police departments and social services agencies, for example, routinely garnish the dividend checks of people who owe fines or delinquent child support payments they have begun calculating the costs of what cannot be collected or distributed. Mr. Walker, who proposed a raft of new taxes to keep state programs afloat, including the reintroduction of an income tax, repealed in 1980 after the oil boom hit, said in his veto message that inaction by the Legislature had become a threat to Alaska’s future, requiring a response from the executive branch. He also said that the Legislature’s plan to rely on borrowing from a savings fund to keep programs afloat  —   and the refusal by a majority of lawmakers to consider any significant increase in taxes paid by residents  —   meant that problems will grow worse. “My team and I introduced a balanced plan in December that fairly distributed the burden across all demographics. Not a single measure of that plan was passed by the Legislature, nor was another plan even introduced,” Mr. Walker said. On Thursday, at a news conference before the Legislature’s adjournment, his exasperation was clear. “How bad does it have to get before we actually do something?” he asked. Budget pressures have pushed Alaska to make structural changes that people in both parties say will ultimately be good for the state. An overhaul of the criminal justice system, for example, that was signed into law by Mr. Walker on Monday and supported by lawmakers in both parties, aims to reduce the prison population by 13 percent over the next eight years partly by reducing penalties for nonviolent offenses like drug possession, saving the state $380 million. Some of those savings will be reinvested into drug treatment services,   support for offenders returning home from prison, violence prevention programming and crime victims’ services. Mr. Walker, a former energy lawyer and mayor of Valdez in southern Alaska, has said that his unaffiliated political status has given him greater latitude to push for changes like justice reform and fiscal overhaul. But as his allies have pointed out, Mr. Walker has constructed his administration in a way that could now divide or confound the governor’s enemies. A former Republican candidate for the United States Senate, Joe Miller, is leading the recall drive to kick Mr. Walker out. But if Mr. Miller’s efforts are successful, they would propel a Democrat, Lt. Gov. Byron I. Mallott, into office."
Huffington Post Scolds Chris Wallace: Won’t Pull a Candy Crowley in Final Presidential Debate - Breitbart,"The current lead story on the Huffington Post, headlined, “Chris Wallace Won’t Call Candidates On Their Lies During Last Presidential Debate,” attacks the Fox News anchor for believing that he should not be a participant in the presidential debate he is moderating  —   a la Candy Crowley in 2012.   From the Huffington Post: Chris Wallace says it won’t be his job to separate truth from fiction in his historic role as moderator of the final debate before the November election. Wallace, who earlier this month became the first journalist from Fox News to be chosen to moderate a presidential debate  spoke to the network’s Howard Kurtz about the difficulties of the job and his aim to “ask smart questions” and “engage the two [candidates] in conversation. ” But when Kurtz asked how Wallace planned to negotiate a campaign fraught withfalsehoods and unfounded accusations, Wallace’s answer was less than comforting. “That’s not my job,” Wallace, who hosts Fox News Sunday, said. “I do not believe that it’s my job to be a truth squad. It’s up to the other person to catch them on that. I certainly am going to try to maintain some semblance of equal time if one of them is filibustering, I’m going to try to break in respectfully and give the other person a chance to talk. ” Read the rest of the story here."
The Trump administration could turn its back on the liberal world order created after World War II,"’  ’ ’   The European Union and the NATO alliance have been pillars in the   Western liberal world order since World War II  —   and US     Donald Trump seems indifferent about their   survival. ’ ’   Trump  by repeating his assertions that NATO is ”obsolete”   and remarking that the EU’’s future didn’’t matter much to the US.   His comments  and outgoing Vice   President Joe Biden  during the World Economic   Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week. ’ ’   ”Defending the liberal international order requires that we   resist the forces of European disintegration and maintain our   longstanding insistence on a Europe whole, free, and at peace,”   Biden said. ”The EU has been an indispensable partner of the   United States.” ’ ’   Stewart Patrick, a senior fellow in global governance at the   Council on Foreign Relations, warned that the US could see ”a   revolutionary break in more than 70 years of American foreign   policy” if these institutions were to crumble. ’ ’   ”[It] would signal the rapid erosion of the Western liberal order   that has been nurtured and defended by the US since the second   World War,” Patrick told Business Insider. ”I find the comments   extremely concerning.” ’ ’   Still, Judy Dempsey, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Europe think   tank, said NATO and the EU are not doing to disappear anytime   soon. ’ ’   ”The idea that NATO is about to collapse and disappear, it’’s   simply not in the cards,” Dempsey told Business Insider. ’ ’   And the EU ”is an immensely complex construction and Trump has no   idea how it functions,” she said. ’ ’   But both institutions are more fragile than they were even a year   ago. ’ ’  ’ ’   The most recent shock to the EU came in June when Britain voted   to leave the bloc.

Trump doesn’t seem to have a high   opinion of the alliance, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has   been actively seeking to weaken it. ” ’   ”To have the   call into question the enduring   commitment to NATO is disturbing,” Patrick said. ’ ”   One of Trump’s main complaints about the alliance is that member   countries rely too much on the US and don’t contribute enough to   their own defense. He has  that NATO doesn’t focus enough on counterterrorism. ” ’   Germany’’s foreign minister   Steinmeier  that Trump’’s comments led to ”astonishment and   agitation” within NATO. ’ ’   Patrick said Trump has challenged ”the notion of a     international system” and created uncertainty about ”whether the   US is willing to champion this world order.” ’ ’   Nevertheless, Trump does have some support from within NATO. ’ ’   A top NATO general  that some aspects of the alliance are indeed   obsolete. ’ ’   ”When I look at the threats we are facing now, we see that we may   have focused too much, until the Ukraine crisis, we may have   focused too much on expeditionary operations, especially in   Afghanistan, and doing that, NATO has a bit failed to look at the   change in the strategic background,” said French air force Gen.   Denis Mercier, the senior NATO commander based in the United   States. ’ ’   ”We have some structures that are obsolete.” ’ ”   Complaints of obsolescence and an   on the US in   NATO aren’t unique to Trump. ” ’   ”Donald Trump is not the first person to suggest that NATO   allies are not pulling their weight or that NATO has to have a   new rationale in the   War world,” Patrick said. ’ ’   But keeping NATO intact is in the interest of the US, he argued. ’ ’   ”There are ongoing debates about the degree to which other   countries are free riding on US contributions,” Patrick said.   ”But the previous presidents and foreign policy experts   …     have   invested in NATO and also in support of the EU because they see   this as a case of enlightened   that the community   of market democracies believe in certain things and believe in a   certain type of order and that cementing that relationship was   important.” ’ ’  ’ ’   Dempsey, the Carnegie fellow, agreed that the ”America first”   isolationism that Trump has trumpeted isn’’t likely to benefit   American security interests. ’ ’   ”[Trump] needs allies in southeast Asia, he needs allies in   Europe,” she said. ”Security is no longer the luxury of just one   state anymore because of cyber security, hybrid war, you name   it.” ’ ’   It’’s unclear what exactly Trump intends to do about NATO once he   takes office. Despite calling the alliance ”obsolete,” he has    it is ”very important to him.” ’ ’   Patrick said he hopes Trump’’s advisers encourage him to ”offer   more temperate remarks.” ’ ’   ”The more that the   actually offers words of   reassurance the better because by making very   and   intemperate remarks, he risks unleashing dynamics of which he’’s   not entirely in control,” Patrick said. ’ ”   In any case, Trump’s unpredictability was a hallmark of his   run for president. ” ’   ”It’’s as if sometimes you think that the incoming administration   is turning its back on the liberal order created after 1945,”   Dempsey said. ”Trump is a new era, there’s no doubt about that.” ’"
UN officials say the best chance at a 2 state solution in Israel is slipping away,"’  ’ ’   A   solution to the   conflict is   slipping away, the U. N. special coordinator for Middle East peace   warned on Sunday, after both sides shrugged off criticism by   international mediators. ’ ’   A report released on Friday by the   Quartet   United   States, European Union, United Nations and Russia   called on   Israel to stop its policy of building settlements on occupied   land and restricting Palestinian development. ’ ’   Israeli policy ”is steadily eroding the viability of the     solution,” it said. It also urged the Palestinian   Authority, which exercises limited   in the West Bank,   take steps to end incitement to violence against Israelis,   condemn ”all acts of terrorism” and do more to combat them. ’ ’   ”The Quartet report sounds an alarm bell that we are on a   dangerous slope towards a   reality that is incompatible   with the national aspirations of both peoples,” wrote Nickolay   Mladenov, U. N. special coordinator for the Middle East peace   process, in a commentary emailed to journalists on Sunday. ’ ’   He also addressed Palestinian and Israeli criticism of the   Quartet report. ”Who will make the argument that more cannot be   done to end incitement?” he asked. ”Can anyone question that   illegal settlements . .. are not undermining the prospect for a     solution?” ’ ’   Israel welcomed parts of the Quartet report but signaled no   change in settlement building, saying the document ”perpetuates   the myth that Israeli construction in the West Bank is an   obstacle to peace”. ’ ’   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Palestinian refusal to   recognize Israel as a Jewish state is at the heart of the   impasse. ’ ’  ’ ’   A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas expressed   disappointment that the Quartet did not call for full Israeli   withdrawal to lines that existed before the Israel captured the   West Bank and East Jerusalem in a 1967 war. ’ ’   The Palestinians want an independent state in those areas and in   the Gaza Strip, a coastal enclave controlled since 2007 by the   Islamist Hamas group. Peace talks collapsed in April 2014 and     violence has surged in recent months. ’ ”   Mladenov appealed to Israeli and Palestinian leaders to implement   the report’s recommendations, offering the help of the   international community to do so. ” ’   ”I urge leaders on both sides not to miss this opportunity,” he   wrote. ’"
U.N. Report Blames Israel for Palestinian Men Beating Their Wives,"A new report by a United Nations expert, and submitted to the U. N. Human Rights Council, blames Israel in part for Palestinian men beating their wives  —   offering more fuel to those in the Trump administration seeking to leave the council over its   bias. [The document, first reported by U. N. Watch, which monitors the international body, was written by Dubravka Šimonović  —   the Special Rapporteur on violence against women  —   who filed dual reports based on her trips to the region in 2016. The report in question focuses on the “causes and consequences” of violence against women in the region.  In her filing on Israel, Šimonović highlights what she claims is a “clear linkage” between the “Israeli occupation” and Palestinian domestic abuse: While recognizing the imperatives related to security and stability in the region, the Rapporteur highlights the clear linkage between the prolonged occupation and [violence against women] and she notes, like her predecessor, that the occupation does not exonerate the State of Palestine from its due human rights obligation to prevent, investigate, punish and provide remedies for acts of   violence (GBV) in the areas and for persons under its jurisdiction or effective control. The report states:  Several testimonies the Rapporteur collected highlighted that the economic situation, the level of unemployment and the pressure of the occupation have a greater impact on women’s and children’s lives, making them more vulnerable to domestic violence, in particular in Gaza, due to the constant pressure felt by the blockade and the recurring cycles of conflict, and the overcrowding that limits their mobility and privacy. While Šimonović does partly blame traditions and culture within Palestinian society, her report still fingered Israel in those sections. For instance, the report claims that “decades of Israeli occupation in parallel with the continuation of patriarchal attitude in Palestinian society expose women to subordination and continuing violence. ” However, while in some places the report does state that what it calls “the State of Palestine” has a responsibility, it also mitigates that responsibility in other sections, at one point claiming: “the occupation is a real obstacle to the State’s due diligence obligation to prevent violence against women in areas where it does not have full jurisdiction  …    ”  “Israeli occupation” refers to Israel’s presence in the West Bank, which is dotted with historic Jewish towns and Jewish holy sites and eastern Jersualem, home of the Western Wall and Temple Mount. The Human Rights Council has long been accused of   bias. U. S. Ambassador Nikki Haley has repeatedly called the council out on its bias, and threatened that the U. S. may leave that body if it does not reform its membership and focus less on Israel. At a debate on the report at the Human Rights Council in Geneva, U. N. Watch representative Hillel Neuer criticized Šimonović and accused her of “infantilizing” Palestinian men, and questioned why she did not spend more time on the issue of “tradition and culture,” arguing that Palestinian TV gives advice to husbands on how to hit their wives. Šimonović responded by clarifying that “any man who is beating his wife is responsible  —   he is a perpetrator of violence. ”  “But when we are speaking about human rights responsibility and due diligence responsibility, then we are at a different level, because states have due diligence responsibility to prevent violence against women and to establish measures to prevent such violence to punish perpetrators of violence and to provide compensation to victims,” she said.

China Sees New Ambiguity With Donald Trump’s Taiwan Call - The New York Times,"BEIJING  —   China’s leaders have been markedly reticent about what kind of leader they think Donald J. Trump will be. A pragmatic dealmaker, as his business background might indicate? Or a provocateur who tests the ways of statecraft? By talking on Friday with Taiwan’s president, Tsai   Mr. Trump answered that question in stark terms, Chinese analysts said Saturday. Breaking decades of American diplomatic practice, he caught the Chinese government off guard by lunging into the most sensitive of its   core interests, the “One China” policy agreed to by President Richard M. Nixon more than four decades ago. “This is a   call for Beijing  —   we should buckle up for a pretty rocky six months or year in the  . S. relationship,” Wang Dong, an associate professor at the School of International Studies at Peking University, said Saturday. “There was a sort of delusion based on overly optimistic ideas about Trump. That should stop. ” Chinese leaders covet stability in their relationship with Washington, and perhaps for that reason, they have allowed fairly rosy assessments of Mr. Trump to appear in the   news media. Many of those accounts have depicted the   as a practical operator devoid of ideology, the kind of person China might find common ground with despite his threats of a trade war. In the hope of maintaining a relatively smooth relationship as Mr. Trump begins his administration, Beijing will probably take a    attitude despite his phone call with Ms. Tsai, said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University. Indeed, China’s first official reaction, from Foreign Minister Wang Yi, was fairly benign  —   though it was firm in reiterating the One China policy, under which the United States formally recognized Beijing as China’s sole government in 1978 and broke ties with Taiwan a year later. No American president or   had spoken to a Taiwanese president since then. Mr. Wang blamed Ms. Tsai’s government for arranging the call. “It won’t stand a chance to change the One China policy agreed upon by the international community,” he said. A   statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday, noting that the ministry had filed a formal complaint with the United States government, was similar in tone. It urged “relevant parties in the U. S. ” to “deal with the Taiwan issue in a prudent, proper manner. ” China’s leaders disdain Ms. Tsai, of Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party, who was elected president this year after pledging to wean the island off its economic dependence on China, a policy that won enthusiastic support from younger Taiwanese. China favored her original opponent, Hung   of the Kuomintang, which has sought closer ties with mainland China. (Ms. Hung later dropped out of the race.) Before the election, President Xi Jinping of China met with Ms. Tsai’s predecessor, Ma   also of the Kuomintang, in the first encounter between the leaders of the two governments, a rapprochement that Beijing had long sought. Mr. Trump broke a Chinese taboo merely by using Ms. Tsai’s title. The Chinese state news media refer to the Taiwanese president as the “leader of the Taiwan region,” to indicate that Beijing regards Taiwan not as a sovereign nation but as Chinese territory to eventually be brought under its control. A basic tenet of the Chinese government is that Taiwan, where Chiang  ’s forces fled in 1949 after losing China’s civil war, will be brought back into the fold. According to Mr. Xi, Taiwan is destined to become an integral part of his   China Dream, a vision of an economically successful Communist China astride the world. Mr. Trump’s phone call also violated a longstanding principle of American policy: that the president does not speak to the head of Taiwan’s government, despite selling arms to it. “Interesting how the US sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter after the stunned reaction to his conversation with Ms. Tsai. Though Beijing vehemently protests the arms sales, it also warily acknowledges them as part of   practice. Since the   Washington has signaled to Taiwan that it will not support any military effort to gain independence from China. The Obama administration’s last arms sale to Taiwan, in 2015, was relatively modest  —   consisting of antitank missiles, two frigates and surveillance gear, worth $1. 8 billion in total  —   but it still provoked a bitter denunciation from Beijing. Douglas H. Paal, a former director of the American Institute in Taiwan, which represents American interests there, said it would not be surprising if the United States sold arms to Taiwan early in the Trump administration. Beijing’s reaction would depend on the price tag, the kinds of weapons sold and how the administration informed China of the sale, Mr. Paal said. While it broke diplomatic precedent, Mr. Trump’s conversation with Ms. Tsai could be seen in some ways as following a pattern of Republican presidents’ reaching out to Taiwan, although others did not do so before taking office. George W. Bush, for example, was vocal in his support of Taiwan early in his presidency, saying in a television interview that the United States would do “whatever it took” to defend it. His aides said afterward that the comment did not reflect a change in the One China policy. By the end of his second term, Mr. Bush had helped to strengthen trade ties between Beijing and Washington through the approval of China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. Though Mr. Trump has received generally favorable coverage in the state news media, some Chinese analysts have expressed irritation with him, and some have suggested that his administration will offer China opportunities to show strength. Yan Xuetong, a professor of international relations at Tsinghua University and a foreign policy hawk, said the overall tenor of the   States relationship in the coming years would depend a great deal on the personal chemistry between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi. He said China, with its growing military and the   economy in the world, could largely afford to act as it liked. “China is increasingly resilient to the United States,” he said. Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, took a contrarian view of Mr. Trump’s call with Ms. Tsai: He said it was not a problem because Mr. Trump had yet to take office. “He is a private citizen,” he said. But if such contacts continue after Inauguration Day, Mr. Shen said, China should end diplomatic relations with the United States. “I would close our embassy in Washington and withdraw our diplomats,” he said. “I would be perfectly happy to end the relationship. I don’t know how you are then going to expect China to cooperate on Iran and North Korea and climate change. You are going to ask Taiwan for that?”"
"Obama Designates Two New National Monuments, Protecting 1.65 Million Acres - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   President Obama designated two new national monuments on Wednesday, protecting 1. 35 million acres of federal land surrounding the Bears Ears Buttes in southeastern Utah and about 300, 000 acres around Gold Butte in Nevada, northeast of Las Vegas. The monuments are Mr. Obama’s latest effort to protect public lands and waters from development and to nail down as much of his environmental legacy as he can before Donald J. Trump assumes the presidency on Jan. 20. But some local residents and elected Republicans have opposed the Obama administration’s extensive efforts to protect Western landscapes, calling them federal land grabs, and Utah officials voiced vehement opposition on Wednesday. The family of a Nevada rancher, Cliven Bundy, helped take over a national wildlife refuge this year in protest against such federal actions. The new desert monuments, designated under the executive authority of the 1906 Antiquities Act, encompass Native American sites of sacred and archaeological importance, as well as wildlife habitats and hiking and hunting terrain. Efforts to place the Bears Ears Buttes under federal protection have been underway since 1936, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s interior secretary, Harold L. Ickes, proposed the monument designation. Native American tribes began promoting legislation to protect Gold Butte in 2008. “Today’s actions will help protect this cultural legacy and will ensure that future generations are able to enjoy and appreciate these scenic and historic landscapes,” Mr. Obama said in a statement. In Utah, the Bears Ears designation was roundly opposed by statewide elected officials and the congressional delegation. “President Obama’s unilateral decision to invoke the Antiquities Act in Utah politicizes a   conflict,” said Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah. “The midnight move is a slap in the face to the people of Utah, attempting to silence the voices of those who will bear the heavy burden it imposes. ” Representative Rob Bishop, Republican of Utah and chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, which has authority over public lands issues, promised to work to repeal the designation. Mr. Obama has designated about 553 million acres as national monuments, more than any of his predecessors. While Mr. Trump has vowed to undo Mr. Obama’s environmental agenda, White House officials said they did not believe he would have the authority to reverse the designations. No president has undone a predecessor’s designations in the law’s   history. “The Antiquities Act gives the authority to create monuments and does not give explicit authority to undo them,” said Christy Goldfuss, the managing director of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. However, after Mr. Obama this month used an obscure provision of a 1953 law to place about 115 million acres in the Arctic Ocean and about 3. 8 million acres of the Atlantic Ocean permanently   to drilling, opponents, including oil companies, said they intended to file a legal challenge. Native American groups and environmentalists hailed Mr. Obama’s moves Wednesday in Nevada and Utah. Mr. Obama’s designation of Bears Ears as a national monument will create a     tribal commission of representatives from the five Native American tribes that live in the region. The commission will advise the monument’s federal managers. “This is an exciting day for Navajo Nation,” Russell Begaye, the tribe’s president, said in a phone call with reporters. “We have always looked to Bears Ears as a place of refuge, as a place where we can gather herbs and plants and as a place of sacredness,” he said. “It is a place of safety and fortitude. It is a place where our ancestors hid and survived from U. S. cavalry during the Long War. ”"

More Fake News: New York Times Calls Bannon ’White Nationalist’,"The New York Times has run yet another fake news article  —   this time, an “explainer” about “white nationalism” that features a photograph of Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon under the headline “White Nationalism, Explained. ”[Bannon is not a “white nationalist. ” In fact, he is not a racist at all, a fact attested to by everyone who has worked with him, including the diverse staff at Breitbart News.  In two separate interviews conducted since Bannon  —   on leave from Breitbart  —   was appointed Chief Strategist and Senior Counselor to   Donald J. Trump, Bannon has made his views explicit. “I’m not a white nationalist, I’m a nationalist. I’m an economic nationalist,” he told Michael Wolff of the Hollywood Reporter. Likewise, he told Kimberly A. Strassel of the Wall Street Journal: “I’ve never been a supporter of  . ” And yet the Times presents Bannon as Exhibit A in “white nationalism. ” The article’s   author, Amanda Taub, reports the following in the text itself (the portion emphasized also appears in the caption underneath the photograph of Bannon): Mr. Trump’s appointment of Mr. Bannon as his senior counselor and chief West Wing strategist has, more than anything, brought white nationalism to the forefront of conversation. He is the former editor of Breitbart News, a site he described in August to Mother Jones as “the platform of the  . ” Although the   is ideologically broader than white nationalism  —   it also includes neoreactionaries, monarchists, and   internet trolls  —   white nationalism makes up a significant part of its appeal. Note that Taub is careful not to say directly that Bannon is a “white nationalist”  —   because he is not, and she likely knows it. However, she leads readers to draw that conclusion, and leaves out anything that Bannon, or Breitbart, said to the contrary. Taub’s article is the second “fake news” item on this topic in the past 24 hours.

YouTube Adds Trigger Warning to ’Milo Tosser’ Game Footage,"The video game Milo Tosser, wherein players throw Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos off a roof to a bloody death by Islamic State jihadists, has come under fire for being “homophobic” and “” according to Newsweek. [The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Los   Jewish human rights organization which tries to censor the Internet by “removing hate speech,” urged YouTube on Wednesday to take down videos involving footage from Milo Tosser on the premise that they are offensive to the Islamic and LGBT community.   YouTube has since displayed a trigger warning to users warning them that the content may be “offensive or inappropriate. ” “YouTube’s policies prohibit hate speech against individuals or groups based on sexual orientation or gender identity,” a YouTube spokesperson told Newsweek. “However, we allow content when the intent is satire or to expose hateful views. When a video is identified as being potentially offensive, we’re careful to apply warnings for users before the video plays. ” Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the associate dean for the Wiesenthal Center, has argued that the video should be removed. “It just touches so many points. It’s homophobic and   and violent —  the fact of the matter is that Riff Raff Games made a game out of killing an actual, live human being,” Cooper said. “This is really outrageous. And you thought you’ve seen it all. ” However, the game  —   which is closely related to a column written by Yiannopoulos titled “I’m a Gay Man and Mass Muslim Immigration Terrifies Me,” has been endorsed by the Milo himself, who said he “loves” the game. “It’s an interesting moral question: Whose right comes first?” Yiannopoulos says in regard to gays and Muslims. “The game shines a light on an awkward victim hierarchy created by the progressive left. ” The creator of the game is Michael Garber, a software engineer based in California, who describes himself as a “video game enthusiast,   [and] freedom of speech advocate. ” Garber said that although the game was originally created as a general portrayal of homophobic   killings, he chose to focus it on Yiannopoulos after a suggestion from a friend. “It was a game to spread awareness about what’s happening and have a laugh,” Garber told Newsweek. “We sort of live in an outrage culture. I think people get too worked [up] over jokes or things they shouldn’t be. ” “I think we need to be able to criticize bad ideas,” Garber says. “Fundamental Islam has a lot of bad ideas. In the United States, fundamental Islam is not a problem, but in   countries, it is a problem. I do this because I care about human rights. ” Milo Tosser is available for download on Windows, Android, and Mac.

Trump Addressed Joint Session of Congress For the First Time - The New York Times,"President Trump addressed a joint session of Congress for the first time. Here’s how we analyzed it in real time, and our live fact checks. The State of the Union is   …     not happening this year, technically. But in a   address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, President Trump was expected to deliver the equivalent: a speech intended to set the course for his   policy agenda and mollify concerns on Capitol Hill after his uneven first month in office. ■ The president tries to set the tone in an   interview on “Fox and Friends. ” He gives himself a grade of A so far. ■ Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York, said he would break a nearly   streak and not try to greet the president, citing policy differences. Here is what to keep an eye on: President Trump suggested on Tuesday that the recent spate of   bomb threats and cemetery vandalism could be politically coordinated attacks to “make people look bad”  —   an apparent suggestion that his opponents could be behind them. Speaking at the White House to attorneys general from around the country, Mr. Trump was asked by Josh Shapiro, the attorney general of Pennsylvania, about the wave of attacks and how the federal government could work with state governments to confront the violence. “First, he said the acts were reprehensible,” Mr. Shapiro, a Democrat who was elected to the post in November, said while recounting Mr. Trump’s response. “Second he said: ‘And you’ve got to be careful, it could be the reverse. This could be the reverse, trying to make people look bad.’ ” The comments echoed the Twitter post of an adviser, Anthony Scaramucci, who suggested that Democrats were behind threats to Jewish community centers. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump was questioned for his seemingly reluctant denunciation of David Duke, the former Klansman who backed him, and for the onslaught of   hate from supporters on social media. At a news conference this month, Mr. Trump suggested that people who were holding up   signs at rallies were doing so to make him look bad. “Some of it is written by our opponents,” Mr. Trump said at the time. “You do know that. Do you understand that?” Approximately 100 tombstones were toppled at a Jewish cemetery in Philadelphia this week, the second such attack in the city in the last month. Synagogues, community centers and cemeteries around the country have been targeted this year. Democrats condemned Mr. Trump’s remarks on Tuesday and called for an apology. “For millennia, Jews have not only endured unthinkable violence, but the subsequent denial of that violence,” said Eric Walker, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee. “For the president of the United States to insinuate that threats to Jewish community centers are illegitimate is truly beyond the pale. ” The   League, which combats   said it was “astonished” by Mr. Trump’s sentiments and called on him to clarify his remarks. Mr. Shapiro, speaking on the sidelines of the attorneys general conference, said that he was not entirely sure of what to make of Mr. Trump’s comments. “I was a little surprised by it, and others were, too, Republicans and Democrats,” Mr. Shapiro said. “The question I asked was a genuine one and one of great concern to people in my state. ” Mr. Trump told the attorneys general that he planned to discuss the issue during his address to Congress on Tuesday night. Mr. Trump gave his presidency an A so far in an interview broadcast Tuesday morning, but he added that he would only give himself a C for communicating how great he has been. Appearing on “Fox and Friends,” which he has called one of his favorite shows, Mr. Trump blamed former President Barack Obama for organizing opposition against him, called Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, “incompetent” and gently criticized his own press secretary for how he has handled leaks. The interview, shown just hours before Mr. Trump was to deliver his first address to a joint session of Congress, set the stage for a day when he will have perhaps the biggest audience available to him for the rest of his first year in office. He highlighted his plans to increase military spending, tighten borders and replace Mr. Obama’s health care program, and he boasted that he had already brought back jobs to America. “I think I’ve done great things, but I don’t think I have  —   I and my people  —   I don’t think we’ve explained it well enough to the American public,” he said. “I think I get an A in terms of what I’ve actually done, but in terms of messaging, I’d give myself a C or a  . ” He acknowledged that he did not have the support of a majority of Americans in polls, but he said those who do back him were more intense. “The love is great,” he said. “And I saw a poll where I was at 45 or 46 percent, but one of the things they said is that the level of enthusiasm for me is as strong as they’ve ever seen. ” Mr. Trump rejected criticism by Ms. Pelosi, who said that for all the sound and fury, the president had not actually accomplished much in his first month in office. “I’ve been watching Nancy’s tape, and so I think she’s incompetent, actually,” Mr. Trump said. Asked by the Fox hosts if he thought Mr. Obama was responsible for some of the protests against his policies, Mr. Trump agreed but brushed it off. “I think he is behind it,” he said. “I also think it’s politics,” adding, “And look, I have a very thick skin. ” Mr. Trump, who has railed against leaks, said some of them had probably come from holdovers from the Obama administration. But he said his press secretary, Sean Spicer, was wrong to have brought a group of staff members into his office and inspect their cellphones in the presence of White House lawyers. “Sean Spicer is a fine human being he’s a fine person,” Mr. Trump said. “I would have done it differently. I would have gone    with different people. ” He added: “I would have handled it differently than Sean. But Sean handles it his way, and I’m O. K. with it. ” For almost three decades, Representative Eliot L. Engel, a New York Democrat, has stood along the aisle of the House chamber for every presidential address to Congress, waiting to shake the president’s hand. But on Tuesday evening, Mr. Trump will become the first president since 1989 to not receive a greeting from Mr. Engel. As curious reporters mused whether Mr. Engel would repeat his annual ritual of claiming his seat long before the address begins, the lawmaker bypassed the prime empty aisle seat and a chance to shake hands with his fellow New Yorker. Among other disagreements that factored into his decision to skip the handshake, Mr. Engel said, were Mr. Trump’s unwillingness to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election and his attacks on the news media. “The president needs to work with all people,” Mr. Engel said. “And therefore I will listen to what he has to say today, but I will not greet him and shake his hand. ” Mr. Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, has been among Mr. Trump’s most vocal critics in the House, pressing for further investigations into the administration’s ties to Russia. In January Mr. Engel introduced legislation that would punish any foreign entity found to have intervened in a federal election. Some Democrats planned to make a statement with their wardrobe as well: A group of female members planned to wear white, the color of the suffragist movement, in a signal to Mr. Trump on women’s rights. Representative Lois Frankel of Florida, the chairwoman of the Democratic Women’s Working Group, said on Twitter that the choice of attire symbolized “a pledge to protect women’s health, fair pay, paid leave  more!” Based on the preview that his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, gave reporters on Monday, Mr. Trump is expected to hark back to his “law and order” theme by promising more aggressive federal policing of gun crimes, drugs and other areas in response to a rise in violent crime in some big cities. Crime is near historic lows nationwide and remains far below levels seen in the 1970s and ‘80s. But Mr. Sessions, a former senator and prosecutor who was an important campaign adviser to Mr. Trump, told reporters he was worried that the increase in violence in some major cities, like Chicago and Baltimore, was “not a blip” and could signal “a   trend. ” Mr. Sessions gave speech of his own on that topic Tuesday morning to the National Association of Attorneys General in Washington. Mr. Sessions said he wanted to let local police officers know “that they’re being supported” in Washington, and he suggested that morale was lagging in some departments because of a lack of federal leadership. Mr. Trump will also be trying to affirm his role as commander in chief. In the Fox interview, Mr. Trump described a raid in Yemen that left an American commando and a number of civilians dead as something that generals “wanted to do” and that was planned before he took office, drawing charges that he was deflecting responsibility for a mission he approved. Mr. Trump was asked to respond to William Owens, father of Chief Petty Officer William Owens, 36, the Navy SEAL member who was killed in the Jan. 29 raid. Mr. Owens told The Miami Herald that he refused to meet with the president when his son’s body was returned home, and asked why the new administration had rushed into a “stupid mission. ” “Well, this was a mission that was started before I got here,” Mr. Trump said. “This was something that was, you know, just, they wanted to do. They came to see me, they explained what they wanted to do, the generals. ” Moments later, he reiterated that “this was something that they were looking at for a long time doing. ” His statement drew sharp responses from critics who said he was defying a long tradition of commanders shouldering responsibility for what happens under them. “He’s the opposite of a `buck stops here’ president,” said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. “Trump has a predilection for always blaming somebody else for what goes wrong. ” Andrew Exum, a former Army Ranger who served as a deputy assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration, wrote on Twitter that in the Trump worldview, “Trump is responsible for all the victories, his team for all the defeats. ” Though he spoke of the Yemen mission not as his own, but as a project of “the generals,” Mr. Trump boasted, “My generals are the most respected that we’ve had in many decades, I believe. ” In fact, the military command consists almost entirely of people who were in their posts before he took office. Muslims. Immigrants. A recent detainee. Officially, the Democratic rebuttal to Mr. Trump’s speech will come from Steven L. Beshear, the former governor of Kentucky, who will defend the Affordable Care Act. But inside the House chamber where Mr. Trump will speak, Democrats plan to assemble a cadre of human symbols, bringing as guests several people imperiled by the president’s policies. Eschewing   boycotts of the speech  —   a feature of Mr. Trump’s inaugural address  —   members of Congress have used their invitations as another form of protest. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is bringing an Iraqi refugee who settled in the state in 2010 and is now an American citizen. Representative Nydia M. Velázquez of New York invited Hameed Khalid Darweesh, who worked as a translator for American forces in Iraq and was detained last month at Kennedy International Airport under the Trump administration’s travel ban. Other guests include undocumented immigrants who were protected from deportation under Mr. Obama, an Iranian graduate student and the founder of the Syrian Community Network."
Donald Trump Takes Lead as Hillary Clinton’s Unfavorability Rises,"Despite Hillary Clinton raising $264, 973, 438 to Donald Trump’s $51, 393, 537, the latest Washington   News poll found Trump winning among registered voters by 46 to 44 percent over Clinton. [The Post seemed almost dismissive regarding the latest poll results. Instead of a big banner headline stating that Trump had made an   gain on Clinton since their March poll to take his first presidential contest lead, the Post carried the story “below the fold” with a headline, “Poll: Election 2016 Shapes up as a Contest of Negatives. ”  The Post is correct that “[n]ever in the history of the   poll have the two major party nominees been viewed as harshly as Clinton and Trump. ” Both Trump and Clinton are seen among registered voters as unfavorable by 57 percent, while Clinton leads in favorability by only 41 to 40 percent for Trump. But that is a stunning change from the Post’s March Poll, which found Clinton leading Trump by 16 percentage points in favorability, 46 to 30 percent, while Trump was seen as 15 points more unfavorable than Clinton, 67 to 52 percent. Having already become the “presumptive nominee” Donald Trump has been on a goodwill tour to burnish his credentials among the same Republican establishment he used effectively as a whipping boy to gain viral credibility with Republican   . Clinton remains locked in the political equivalent of a cage match with Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) who was able to spend $160 million from January through April tattooing Clinton as “the establishment candidate. ” Although the Sanders campaign began May with just $5. 8 million cash on hand compared to Clinton’s $30 million available, Sanders outraised Clinton $27 million to $25 million in April. Clinton’s efforts to turn her attention to Trump have been upended by Sanders’s fundraising prowess. Sanders communications director Michael Briggs said in an email late on Friday, May 20, “We’ve made fundraising history, and we’re still going strong. ” As an avowed socialist who is now the darling of youth and the “social justice warrior” base of the Democrat Party, Sanders vows to stay in the race and “fight for every vote. ” The only reason Clinton kept close to Sanders in fundraising is tapping over 99 percent of the $60 million raised by the “Hillary Victory Fund. ” The   joint fundraising committee is comprised of Clinton’s presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee, and 32 state party committees. It was advertised as building state infrastructure for a grassroots     effort in the November general election. The Victory Fund did make transfers of $3. 8 million, or 6 percent, to the state parties. But $3. 3 million, or 88 percent, was wired within two days to the Democrat National Committee by the Clinton staffers that control the DNC, according to POLITICO. The only optimistic spin for Ms. Clinton in the Washington   News poll is that she is favored by U. S. residents 44 to 37 percent over Trump, while Trump seen as more unfavorable by 60 to 53 percent. But only registered voters can vote. Perhaps more illuminating, Sanders is favored over Clinton by 51 to 44 percent, while Clinton’s unfavorability is 53 to 38 percent versus Sanders. In the last few days, Sanders has been barnstorming across California in a bid to win the state’s 475 pledged delegates. While Sanders is drawingtens of thousands of rabidly cheering fans at packed arenas, Hillary surrogate former President Bill Clinton has brought out smaller crowds at his rallies. The latest Real Clear Politics California poll survey has Clinton leading Sanders by 51 to 41. 3 percent. But if Sanders upsets Clinton, she will limp into the Philadelphia Democrat National Convention as the least popular nominee since President Carter’s 1980 reelection bid. Both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns agreed in February to hold debates in California, but dates were never scheduled. Sanders on May 18 accepted Fox News’ offer to hold a Democrat debate ahead of the June 7 California primary Clinton declined on May 23. Clinton’s advisers told The Hill that regarding debates, “We have had enough of them. The only one that would benefit from another is Trump. ” But if Sanders and Trump both portray Clinton as a coward too afraid to face the American people, her favorable ratings will continue to fall and her unfavorable ratings will continue to rise.

"‘Swiss Army Man,’ the Strangest Movie Shown at Sundance? - The New York Times","LOS ANGELES  —   In “Swiss Army Man,” Hank (Paul Dano) a castaway stranded on a deserted island, spies a body washed up on the beach. Driven   by hunger and despair, he rushes into the surf, only to discover that the body, played by Daniel Radcliffe, is lifeless. Or is it? To Hank’s surprise, the corpse breaks wind, loudly and lustily. Moments later, Hank whoops with glee as he pilots the   Mr. Radcliffe across a   ocean. When “Swiss Army Man” had its premiere at Sundance in January, it became one of the festival’s most   films, eventually winning a directing award. But despite positive reviews (Variety said it was “constantly inventive,” and The Hollywood Reporter called it “bizarrely poetic”) festivalgoers walked out in droves and Vanity Fair wondered if it wasn’t the strangest film in Sundance history. For online commentators who hadn’t seen the film, “Swiss Army Man,” a. k. a. “Daniel Radcliffe’s   movie,” became an easy target. “The premise kind of lends itself to that,” acknowledged Daniel Kwan, the film’s  . “A lot of the   reactions online have been about how stupid this movie sounds. ” Known professionally as Daniels, Mr. Kwan and Daniel Scheinert have created some of the most inventive and visceral shorts and music videos of the past decade. Other directors, like Spike Jonze and Antoine Fuqua, have graduated from music videos to feature films, but few have made music videos as unsettling as Daniels’ work. Which was why no one was pounding on their doors to make “Swiss Army Man. ” The film, which opens Friday, June 24, is the first feature from Mr. Kwan, 28, and Mr. Scheinert, 29. The two are here in the backyard studio of Mr. Kwan’s Highland Park neighborhood home, which he shares with his fiancée, Kirsten Lepore, an   animator. Mr. Kwan’s brother, James, lives here, too he’s an animator and children’s book writer and illustrator (“Dear Yeti”). Mr. Scheinert lives less than a   away. “When we were editing the film here, I would just walk over with my dog every day,” Mr. Scheinert said. The directors, who often finish each other’s sentences and stories or clarify each other’s points, met in a   animation class at Emerson College in Boston. “We didn’t like each other at first,” Mr. Scheinert said, adding that he overparticipated and that Mr. Kwan underparticipated, coming off “like a ‘wasting his parents’ money’ film kid. ” But they soon bonded after they discovered they shared similarly twisted artistic sensibilities. Mr. Kwan’s final school project was an animated short about an insomniac who undresses people while they sleep and does their laundry for them Mr. Scheinert’s starred a dead boy whose body is piloted by small tigers. They began directing music videos and short films together, fantastical pieces in which small dogs are ridden like skateboards (“Dogboarding”) a man kills a red ball after it makes love with his wife (“Interesting Ball”) and a drunk partyer vomits sparks (“Pigeons,” by the band the Hundred in the Hands). Several went viral many featured the directors in starring roles. “Swiss Army Man” began as little more than a joke. “It was Kwan’s idea, originally,” Mr. Scheinert said. “He pitched me this idea of a guy stranded on a desert island finding a corpse and feeding it beans through a funnel, then riding the farts off into the sunset as beautiful music plays. ” The idea was too expensive to film as a short, but the two kept it in their voluminous backlog of weird ideas. And then another idea hit them. Why not make the corpse an amnesiac who must be reminded of the life he left behind to coax him to find his way back to civilization? That could be a feature, they thought. They toyed with various scenarios, and in 2014 the pair entered the Sundance Institute’s Screenwriter Lab. On their off hours, looking for a mental respite from “talking to all those genius filmmakers about how to make your script better,” they pitched a music video for “Turn Down for What,” a dance track by Lil Jon and DJ Snake. “We were like, this is the stupidest song we’ve ever been sent,” Mr. Scheinert said. “Let’s pitch the stupidest video we’ve ever pitched. ” In the video’s opening moments, Mr. Kwan simulates sex with a neighbor’s TV set, melts a police officer’s face and smashes potted plants against his crotch. “In my head, I was like, this might be the last music video anyone asks us to do,” he said. Instead, “Turn Down for What” became one of the most popular and critically acclaimed music videos of 2014, landing multiple MTV Video Music Award nominations and receiving nearly half a billion YouTube views. After completing the script for “Swiss Army Man,” Daniels began searching for the two leads. “I was in from the second or third page, from the moment Hank rides the farting corpse across the ocean,” Mr. Dano said. “It was so funny and absurd and beautiful and glorious, I was like, why didn’t I think of that?” Mr. Radcliffe soon followed, and the two began working   days in Half Moon Bay, south of San Francisco, and in the redwood forests outside Eureka, Calif. “The atmosphere that the Daniels create on set is like no other I’ve ever worked on,” Mr. Radcliffe said. “They’re so collaborative. Everyone there had either worked together for years on their music videos, or they’d known since college. ” Working with actors of that caliber was a rare treat for the directors. “It spoiled us,” Mr. Kwan said. “We’re used to working with bands who’ve never acted before, or with us and our friends, who don’t really act but just happen to be around. ” The result is not your typical zombie flick or screwball comedy. If anything, it’s a bromance of the purest sort, even though one of the bros is dead, sort of. It’s also a love story, complete with an underwater kiss and the discovery that Mr. Radcliffe’s penis can be used as a field compass. As teenagers, the directors were subjected to “hazing in high school,” Mr. Kwan said. “We were both very expressive boys, neither of us were that good at sports, and that was just something we lived with and kind of accepted. So it’s funny that we tried to make a survival film, which is the most masculine story there is, but ended up making the least manly survival film ever. The two of them sit in the woods, and they talk about their feelings. ”"
Omar Epps Hopes to Battle ’Pandemic’ of Absent Fathers in America with Documentary - Breitbart,"Actor Omar Epps hopes an upcoming documentary he produced can help call attention to what he describes as the “pandemic” of fatherless families in America. [Daddy Don’t Go  —   about four young men struggling to be the best fathers they can be  —   will premiere on video platform Vimeo on Father’s Day in an effort to “activate” fathers across the country.  “I think the traditional family structure has been eviscerated, certainly within impoverished communities,” the    former House star told the Los Angeles Times in an interview. “There’s one thing to be someone’s biological father. But there’s another thing to actually actively father a child and take the reigns of that responsibility. ” According to a synopsis, the film took two years to shoot and centers on four disadvantaged fathers in New York City as they “struggle to beat the odds and defy the deadbeat dad stereotype. ” Epps, who is now a father of three, says the project was special because as a child he didn’t know his own father. “It’s basically following their journeys as active fathers and it’s pretty powerful   …     I didn’t grow up with [my father]. ” he said. “That’s another reason why I felt passionate about this story. I didn’t know my father growing up, and that was that. ” The former Resurrection star believes the film’s Father’s Day release is timely given that “fatherhood has been under attack. ” “It’s sort of a pandemic, certainly in impoverished areas,” he said. “I think that this film will shed light that these guys aren’t smarter than your viewers, necessarily. They’re super   guys in turbulent circumstances, but they’re all actively fathering their children. ” Approximately 65 percent of black children in America today live without a father in the home. Additionally, the absence of a father in the home has been proven to be one of the main predictors of poverty. About 30 percent of Hispanic children and roughly 20 percent of white children live in homes without their biological father. While he doesn’t have a policy solution for this societal dilemma, Epps hopes his new film can at least draw attention to the subject. “I’m not focusing on traditional or   families  —   just family itself, and the notion of children fighting through, and especially the men, to raise their kids,” he said. “I don’t know what would fix that. There are societal things that come into play, economic things, legal things, so it’s not one thing. But I think it starts with the individual. ” Having children, the actor says, changed his life for the better. “It’s part of the fabric of who I am as a human being on this earth,” he said. “You know, to help guide young human beings from before they walk and now my daughter Aiyanna is going to be a senior in high school this year, so it’s been an amazing journey. Being a father is one of the pillars of who I am as a person. ” Daddy Don’t Go is available for   and premieres Sunday.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson"
#JeSuisMilo Is a Tipping Point for Twitter - Breitbart,"After digesting the news that Twitter’s stock was down another 7. 2 percent and four top executives  —   including the chief of engineering  —   were jumping ship, Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos uncorked a Tweetstorm to explain why. [Yiannopoulos makes an excellent point about the nature of Twitter’s strategic error.  They forgot how precarious their position was, and they lost sight of the very thing that made their platform popular in the first place at the very moment it is searching for relevance in the face of strong competition.    Obviously, I can’t take full credit for the drama at Twitter. But I can tell you a few things that might interest you.  —   Milo Yiannopoulos ✘ (@Nero) January 25, 2016,    I now know from multiple sources that institutional investors were watching my case closely to see what Twitter did about their mistake.  —   Milo Yiannopoulos ✘ (@Nero) January 25, 2016,    When a company is in trouble, investors watch very closely to see whether management fixes or doubles down on  .  —   Milo Yiannopoulos ✘ (@Nero) January 25, 2016,    What Twitter did to me hits on three things that investors care about. One, transparency over product and policy. Twitter has none.  —   Milo Yiannopoulos ✘ (@Nero) January 25, 2016,    Two, keeping power users engaged and happy. As a rising star I’m exactly the sort of person Twitter should be embracing, not punishing.  —   Milo Yiannopoulos ✘ (@Nero) January 25, 2016,    Three, user growth. I have brought Twitter thousands of new users  —   people who came to Twitter only to follow me.  —   Milo Yiannopoulos ✘ (@Nero) January 25, 2016,   So my case is the emblematic of all three of Twitter’s biggest problems, and came at just the right time. So: massive press attention.  —   Milo Yiannopoulos ✘ (@Nero) January 25, 2016,    #JeSuisMilo will therefore come to be seen as the tipping point. After #JeSuisMilo, stock dropped more precipitously than before.  —   Milo Yiannopoulos ✘ (@Nero) January 25, 2016,    And now, today, mass exec walkouts. Twitter is dying because instead of creating a great product it became a liberal attack vector.  —   Milo Yiannopoulos ✘ (@Nero) January 25, 2016,    Twitter’s fate could have been avoided. In this case, free speech isn’t just good ethics  —   it’s good business.  —   Milo Yiannopoulos ✘ (@Nero) January 25, 2016,    Oh, and one last thing. They shouldn’t have underestimated my reach, connections, resources and fans. Silly Twitter.  —   Milo Yiannopoulos ✘ (@Nero) January 25, 2016, This is a snapshot of a larger problem reaching across all of social media.  It began with the promise of unfettered, unfiltered conversation  —   an exciting new frontier where anyone could hope to draw major attention, bypassing the editorial gatekeepers of old media.   Before the Internet, the infrastructure of national and global communications required a hierarchy of editors and publishers.  Someone had to own the printing presses, radio stations, and television studios, and someone had to decide how their incredibly limited bandwidth would be allocated.  There were only so many column inches of print available, only so much broadcast time to fill. Social media captured the imagination of a generation because all of that editorial infrastructure was done away with, for better and worse.  It was amazing to watch people form communities and build audiences organically. But now the tide has turned against free speech, in so many ways.  The urge to censor and control flows not just from government agencies, but from corporate management and   vigilante mobs.  It has become fashionable in some quarters to speak openly of crushing dissent, comparing the speech of opponents to “shouting fire in a crowded theater. ”  The desired remedies range from government action, to more subtle and insidious suppression by those who control the means of expression. In the early days of social media, we were overwhelmed by the possibilities for free speech and creativity.  At long last, we would have a true “free market” for ideas, with no one’s thumb on the scales!  Now it’s all thumbs, everywhere you look.   We’re learning painful lessons about censorship, propaganda, and bias.  One of those lessons is that our commitment to free speech cannot end with embracing the First Amendment as a shield against government censorship.  It’s not good enough to say that oppression is cool, as long as the government is not directly involved, and the oppressors are subtle.  Free speech is a positive ideal to be embraced, not a narrow precipice for government agencies to avoid.   Fortunately, we have means of communicating our displeasure to private companies which fail to live up to those ideals.  "
"Taiwan accidentally launches missile toward China, kills fishing boat captain"," (CNN) A Taiwan warship mistakenly launched a supersonic ”aircraft carrier killer” missile toward China Friday, hitting a fishing boat and killing the boat’s captain in an incident China called ”a serious matter.” A spokesman for Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense apologized on behalf of the military. ”The Ministry of National Defense sincerely apologizes for the incident that caused the death of the captain (of the boat) and injured other crew members,” Maj. Gen. Chen   said in a news conference. The ministry has also asked the Navy to provide assistance and compensation to the family of the victims. The deceased captain has been identified as Huang   the defense ministry confirmed, according to Taiwan Focus, the   service of   Central News Agency.   said the missile, the ”Hsiung Feng III,” ripped through the fishing boat but did not explode. An investigation into the incident has begun,   added. China’s top official in charge of Taiwan policy, Zhang Zhijun, said Friday that Taiwan must provide a ”responsible explanation” for the launch of the missile, calling it a ”serious matter.” Relations between Taiwan    officially the Republic of China    and the People’s Republic of China have been increasingly tense since the landslide election of Tsai   whose party has traditionally leaned in favor of formal independence from China."
Russia Looks to Populate Its Far East. Wimps Need Not Apply. - The New York Times,"  Russia  —   Standing ankle deep in mud in a swampy grassland more than 4, 000 miles from his home, Yuri A. Bugaev surveyed a   wasteland that the Russian government is offering to   pioneers under its own   version of the 1862 Homestead Act in the United States. “This is not really what I had in mind,” said Mr. Bugaev, who had traveled across seven time zones from St. Petersburg, Russia, to scout the possibilities for settlers in the country’s sparsely populated Far East, a territory roughly   the size of the United States. The nine Far Eastern regions targeted for settlement in the government’s land giveaway, which began on June 1, encompass more than a third of Russia but are home to only 6. 1 million people. This is just 4 percent of the country’s population and compares with the 110 million Chinese living across the border in the three provinces that make up Manchuria. Mr. Bugaev is a dedicated, if largely sedentary, Cossack, a   fraternity of Slavic warriors, freebooters and   rebels. A romantic throwback to earlier generations of Cossacks who settled and secured the borders of the Russian empire, he sees getting his Cossack brethren and other Russians to move out east as the only way to keep mostly empty Russian lands safe from China. For years, he said, he had dreamed of Russia embracing, or rather   the pioneer spirit, and he was delighted by the Kremlin’s backing of a program meant to reassert the country’s manifest destiny as a   power. All the same, he conceded that not many Russians living in the European side of Russia, who dream of a house in London or Paris, not a shack in a swamp near China, share his zeal for a new life in wild eastern regions that many associate with labor camps and convicts. “Most people these days don’t want an adventure,” he said. The Russian government, however, is intent on proving otherwise and on giving some substance to a command by President Vladimir V. Putin in 2013 that the development of Siberia and the Far East must be “our national priority for the entire 21st century. ” How to get people to settle in the Far East is a question that has preoccupied and confounded Russian rulers since the establishment of a Russian naval base on the Pacific Ocean at Okhotsk in the 17th century. Cossacks, convicts and desperate peasants have often been the only takers. In Communist times, labor camps, heavy investment in remote industrial sites and the construction of a second railroad across Siberia and the Far East revived the eastward flow of people. But this ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and residents began to drift away. A population of more than eight million dwindled by about two million. Russia’s Ministry for the Development of the Far East, the agency managing this latest development gambit, cited a survey it commissioned, saying that 20 percent of Russians would be ready to move east if given free land. Younger Russians, the ministry said, were even more enthusiastic, with more than 50 percent expressing an interest in heading east to take advantage of the offer  —   one free hectare, about two and a half acres, a person. But as often happens in Russia, grandiose hopes and plans have run far ahead of the reality on the ground, where bureaucrats, appalling weather and immense distances conspire to smother the Kremlin’s ambitions. “It is all pie in the sky,” said Vladimir V. Mishchenko, the head of the Khankaisky district, one of nine pilot areas chosen by Moscow to test the free land program. He complained that the whole thing had been dreamed up by people in Moscow who had no understanding of the Far East but needed to show the Kremlin that they were doing something. For the moment, the free land is restricted to small areas, like the Khankaisky area around   an isolated settlement north of Vladivostok, and is open only to Russians already living in the Far East. Starting in February, however, all Russian citizens can apply, and Mr. Bugaev wants to make sure he is ready to “help save Russia. ” At the start of his scouting mission, after a   flight to Vladivostok from Moscow, he found his hotel packed with Chinese, mostly tourists. Donning his Cossack fur hat, he declared his mission even more urgent than he had thought. He set off the next day for   to inspect the land on offer, driving for hours in torrential rain through sodden taiga and mostly empty villages. Undaunted, he said he thought there were enough hardy souls ready to join his organization, the Far Eastern Hectare Social Movement, a private outfit set up in St. Petersburg to drum up interest in the free land program and to organize new settlements. Its website explains that it is possible to be a pioneer without even leaving home, at least to start with. People can simply apply for free land and pool what they get so a larger plot can be developed by a few adventurous souls. If this works, those who contribute land but stay behind in St. Petersburg can move east later, after most of the hard work is done. “Virtually nobody wants to come out here right now,” Mr. Bugaev conceded, complaining that the available plots  —   about 12, 000 square yards a person  —   cannot possibly support sustainable agriculture or any other business venture. (American pioneers got more than 60 times that amount  —   160 acres  —   under the Homestead Act.) The Russian plan has been derided as a dreamy patriotic stunt cooked up by Kremlin image makers or a scam that will end up enriching officials, who have the right to take back the land after five years if they decide development targets have not been met. The Kremlin, however, has thrown its weight behind the program, set in motion this summer with a blitz of publicity on state news media presenting the Far East as an El Dorado of opportunity, and the start of a government website that allows citizens to view plots of land and make online applications. The official website went down as soon as it was unveiled, a mishap that Aleksei A. Navalny, the renowned anticorruption campaigner, said was probably a deliberate malfunction engineered by officials so they could grab the best land for themselves. Mr. Navalny, in a report last month, noted that coveted plots on the shore of a picturesque lake outside   had been snapped up by the time the website started working again. Yan P. Ovodenko, a local official, denied that the lakeside plots had all been taken. A more serious blow to Mr. Bugaev’s hopes was delivered by Mr. Mishchenko, the district head. While the area might look empty, he explained, nearly all the land is already owned or at least claimed by somebody. And even if Mr. Bugaev were to get allotted land, developing it would require cooperation from 22 different government agencies responsible for enforcing a thicket of rules and regulations. “The water code, you have to abide by it town planning code, you have to abide by it land code, you have to abide by it border area rules, you have to abide by them prescriptions of the Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance, you have to abide by them forest regulation, you have to abide by it,” the district chief said. Of the 460 people who have applied since June 1, Mr. Mishchenko said, 390 have been rejected outright because they failed to provide the necessary information. In all, only four people, all from Vladivostok, have thus far secured plots. “For any meaningful agriculture, you need 5, 000 hectares to start off,” Mr. Mishchenko said. “And those lands don’t exist. They’ve been snapped up a long time ago. ” Undeterred by his initial finding in Khankaisky district, Mr. Bugaev pressed on. A Cossack leader in the regional administration in Vladivostok, Oleg Melnikov, assured him that the land giveaway was on track and faced no serious problems. A local company involved in agriculture also liked Mr. Bugaev’s plans for an updated version of collective farming and urged him to focus on trying to find people in St. Petersburg ready to apply for plots of land. “I think this will all work out,” Mr. Bugaev said, warily eyeing Chinese tourists crowded in the lobby of his Vladivostok hotel. “This is not just for adventure but to save Russia. ”"
"DREAMer speaks out on immigration, gets arrested by ICE"," (CNN) She spoke out on behalf of young undocumented immigrants like herself who want legal status. Now she’s in the custody of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Daniela Vargas, 22, was arrested Wednesday after sharing her family’s story    including her father and brother’s arrest last month by ICE officers    during a news conference in Jackson, Mississippi.  Moments before her arrest by ICE, Vargas had advocated for young people who, like herself, were brought to the US illegally as children, then qualified for a temporary reprieve from deportation under the   Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. Recipients often are called DREAMers, a reference to the DREAM Act, which if approved by Congress would give DACA participants permanent legal status. ”The path to citizenship is necessary for DACA recipients but also for the other 11 million undocumented people with dreams,” Vargas told reporters. ”Today, my father and brother await deportation, while I continue to fight this battle as a DREAMer to help contribute to this country, which I feel that is very much my country.” President Donald Trump has identified DACA as an exception to sweeping new orders mandating aggressive enforcement of immigration laws. But new rules issued by the Department of Homeland Security make clear that no undocumented immigrants will be exempt from deportation proceedings. DACA status lapsed, Vargas said she arrived in the United States with her family at age 7 as an undocumented immigrant from Argentina and later was granted DACA status, which lasts two years. Her attorney, Abby Peterson, said Vargas’ DACA status expired in November. She could not immediately afford the minimum $495 renewal application fee, Peterson said, and put off the process until last month. The government recommends DACA recipients apply for a renewal between 150 and 120 days before their status expires. Days after she reapplied, her father and brother on February 15 were taken into ICE custody at their home. Bill Chandler, executive director of the Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance, said he was among immigrant advocates at the scene.  ”We stood vigil outside of the house for about five hours,” Chandler said. ”ICE was trying to persuade Daniela to come out of the house. Of course, she refused. They went and got a search warrant. . .. Then they decided to break into the house and confront her.” ’They threatened her’ ”She was terrified, locked in a closet, ICE pounding on her door, asking what she was supposed to do,” a friend, Angela Stuesse, said. ”And I was also terrified. And that went on for hours.” Vargas convinced the agents she was ”a DACA person,” Chandler said. ”But they threatened her and said they’re going to come back and get her.” Even so, Vargas, who aspires to be a university math teacher, wanted to speak out this week about recent ICE raids, Stuesse said. ”She thought sharing her story might help people,” she said. But shortly after Vargas left the news conference, she encountered federal officers.  ”Just after she spoke, ICE agents retaliated,” said Greisa Martinez Rosas, advocacy director for United We Dream, on a conference call Thursday with reporters. ”ICE agents tracked her down and knocked on her window. And what we know they said is, ’You know who we are, you know why we’re here.’   ”Because her DACA was expired, ICE agents played a game of gotcha with her life,” Martinez said, ’She pays her taxes’ Vargas appreciates the opportunities afforded her in America, her lawyer said. ”Like so many immigrants, she doesn’t take this country for granted,” Peterson said. ”She has pursued an education, she works hard, she pays her taxes. She is a very deserving individual.”  Stuesse, who has known Vargas since she arrived in Mississippi 15 years ago, described her as ”a great kid.” ”She was a member of the band she plays the trumpet,” Stuesse said. ”She got a scholarship to keep going to band for community college but couldn’t pay for the rest of the expenses.” Vargas now manages a small store in Mississippi, Martinez said. ICE confirmed Vargas is in custody: ”US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) took Daniela Vargas, 22, an unlawfully present Argentinian citizen, into custody March 1, during a targeted immigration enforcement action in Jackson, Mississippi.” Peterson said she has not yet spoken with Vargas but will represent her with federal authorities."
Republicans Move to Block Rule on Coal Mining Near Streams - The New York Times,"Republicans on Thursday took one of their first steps to officially dismantle   environmental regulations by easing restrictions on coal mining, bolstering an industry that President Trump has made a symbol of America’s neglected heartland. Using an obscure law that allows Congress to review regulations before they take effect, the Senate voted to reverse the Stream Protection Rule, which seeks to protect the nation’s waterways from debris generated by a practice called surface mining. The Interior Department had said the rule would protect 6, 000 miles of streams and 52, 000 acres of forests by keeping coal mining debris away from nearby waters. The Senate vote was 54 to 45, following a House vote for repeal on Wednesday. “Make no mistake about it, this Obama administration rule is not designed to protect streams,” Representative Bill Johnson, a Republican from Ohio who sponsored the move to reverse the rule, said on Wednesday. “Instead, it was an effort to regulate the coal mining industry right out of business. ” The Senate also moved to reverse a separate rule requiring publicly traded oil, gas and mineral companies to disclose payments to foreign governments for licenses or permits. The disclosure rule was aimed at curbing bribery and at helping   developing countries hold   companies, and their governments, accountable. After a procedural vote on Thursday, final Senate action to cancel the rule is expected Friday, with Mr. Trump’s signature to follow. The Trump administration, which has vowed to peel back regulations, is particularly close to the fossil fuel industry. On Wednesday, the Senate confirmed President Trump’s pick for secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, the former chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil. Exxon had argued that forcing American oil companies to reveal payments to foreign governments would put them at a competitive disadvantage. Full disclosure could also have made it trickier for Exxon to pursue business deals in countries like Russia, where the state plays a central role. Both the coal and   rules were made final in the last days of the Obama administration, putting them in the cross hairs of the   Congress, together with other   Obama regulations yet to take effect. The Stream Protection Rule, which requires companies to restore mined areas to their original physical and ecological state and to monitor for environmental effects, would have effectively made mountaintop removal uneconomical, experts said  —   especially when coal prices remain depressed amid competition from natural gas and renewable energy sources like wind and solar. But the rule was challenged in court almost immediately by Republican attorneys general in states across the country, as well as the   coal giant Murray Energy. The company had previously filed 14, 000 pages of comments opposing stronger regulations. “This unlawful and destructive rule is nothing but a thinly veiled attempt to destroy our nation’s underground coal mines and put our nation’s coal miners out of work,” Robert E. Murray, the company’s chief executive, said in comments released ahead of Thursday’s vote. A report released by the Congressional Research Service last month laid out the environmental and health benefits of the rule. Stream restoration requirements would reduce human exposure to contaminants in the drinking water, and the probability of adverse health effects, the report said. The replanting of trees also required by the rule would increase carbon storage and reduce emissions, aiding in the fight against climate change, the report said. The report also outlined the costs to industry: $52 million in annual compliance costs for the coal industry as a whole, of which roughly half was expected to be borne by mining operations in Appalachia. The rule could endanger up to 590 coal mining jobs in the region, the report estimated, though the losses would be partly offset by engineers and biologists that companies would need to hire to comply with its terms. Even without the rule, coal industry employment would shrink by more than 15, 000 workers, from a total of 90, 000 in 2012, the report noted. Still, on the campaign trail, Mr. Trump had pointed to coal mining’s decline as a symptom of overzealous environmental regulation and the neglect of   Americans by coastal elites. He vowed that, as president, he would “put our miners back to work”  —   a promise that resonated with voters in battleground states, including those in Appalachia. But the American market for coal is shrinking, with or without new rules and regulations. Utility companies have drastically reduced their reliance on coal. Nationally, about 300   power plants have closed since 2008, according to the National Mining Association, a trade group. Many of those plants are not coming back, whatever the policy out of Washington, making it imperative that Appalachia diversify its economy, industry analysts say. Daile Rois, 56, lives about 2, 000 feet from a shuttered coal mine outside Charleston, W. Va. The mine, Keystone Development No. 2, released debris and chemicals into two creeks that meet at the edge of her property and run past her home. After intense opposition from environmental groups, which documented streams clouded by sediment and monitored rising acidity levels, West Virginia’s Department of Environmental Protection permanently closed the mine last year and ordered the operator to restore the site  —   a rare victory for local environmentalists. “Here in West Virginia, many creeks run orange” from the contamination, said Ms. Rois, who moved to West Virginia in 2012 with her partner to take care of elderly relatives. She called the Republican vote to repeal the Stream Protection Rule devastating, a move that would allow mines like Keystone to stay open. “Of course I care about miners’ jobs, and I care about their safety,” Ms. Rois said. “But orange is not the color of water. ”"
Exclusive-Rep. Mark Meadows: House Conservatives Ready on Day One to Help Donald Trump - Breitbart,"House conservatives are preparing a list of 200 federal regulations that   Donald Trump can delete with the stroke of a pen upon entering the White House Jan. 20, a leading member of the House Freedom Caucus tells Breitbart News. [“Recognizing the role of Congress and the executive branch being two separate powers and also recognizing that with a new administration, we want to make it easier for them, so they don’t have to look under every rock and every crook and cranny to find potential overreaches by the executive branch,” says Rep. Mark Meadows (R. . C.). He’s launched a bid to become chairman of the Freedom Caucus as Rep. Jim Jordan is stepping aside.  “We started out with a hundred rules and regulations that we wanted to offer the new administration to be able to address on Day One —  certainly within the first 100 days,” said the congressman, a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. “That list has now grown to 188,” he said. With the list already at 188 economically damaging rules and regulations that could be overturned without legislation, the congressman said his colleagues at the  House Freedom Caucus are confident they can reach 200 by the time Trump becomes the chief executive. There is no question that regulations on the books are holding back America’s job growth and the economy, he said. Meadows said House conservatives seek to give the incoming administration a wide berth as they settle in their offices and in their focus. “We see our role as being ready and prepped for them. ” “As a guy, who never had the federal government help me make payroll —  what I have found in the most useful way conservatives can be helpful is not to demand a certain action, but to highlight the action that is impeding jobs across the country from New York to California and in between —  now that we have a ‘jobs president’ in the White House we don’t have to educate him about the stumbling blocks to job growth,” he said. “We just have to identify where it is in this massive bureaucracy,” the former businessman said. “The 200 regulations, I think will speak for themselves as to how they will spur job growth,” he said. Meadows said the in addition to the work by the House Freedom Caucus, the members and staff of his House Oversight Committee are producing a “Landing Book” for the Trump appointees. The books, specific to each department and agency, are part map, part instruction guide and part cultural awareness resource for those about to lead and engage with the federal bureaucracy, he said. The books are a culmination of eight years of dealing with the administration of President Barack Obama and his administration —  and will be a counterpoint to the packets presented to the new officials by the civil servants. “We’re actually putting together binders,” the congressman said. The books will also have specific information from the House committee with jurisdiction over an office and its mission. “We are trying not to get in and encroach their area of jurisdiction and to be a partner, where it is a    kind of transfer —  I am hopeful we’ll see some real fruits to that coming out. ”"
Ryan: ’We are not planning on erecting a deportation force’," (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan said Sunday despite Donald Trump’s campaign rhetoric, lawmakers are not prepared to form a deportation force to   and deport undocumented immigrants. ”We are not planning on erecting a deportation force. Donald Trump’s not planning on that,” Ryan told CNN’s Jake Tapper on ”State of the Union.” ”I think we should put people’s minds at ease: That is not what our focus is. That is not what we’re focused on. We’re focused on securing the border. We think that’s first and foremost, before we get into any other immigration issue, we’ve got to know who’s coming and going into the country    we’ve got to secure the border,” he added. Trump told CBS’ Lesley Stahl in a ”60 Minutes” interview set to air Sunday night that he still plans to build a   border wall. And asked if he’d accept a fence instead of a wall, Trump said: ”For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I’m very good at this, it’s called construction.” Trump added that ”there could be some fencing.” He did not, though, repeat his campaign promise to deport all undocumented immigrants.  He pledged to focus first on deporting those who have committed crimes within the United States    ”gang members, drug dealers . .. probably two million, it could even be three million”    and worry about others later. ”After the border is secure and after everything gets normalized, we’re going to make a determination on the people that they’re talking about who are terrific people,” Trump said.  Ryan deflected questions about whether he’d support Trump’s calls to slap hefty tariffs on imports from countries like Mexico. Instead, Ryan said, he supports tax reforms to address the same challenges ”without any adverse effects    without any collateral damage to the economy.” The House speaker also said he is on board with Trump’s call to keep some elements of President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. But he won’t commit to mandating insurance coverage of birth control for women at no cost. ”Obamacare is failing. It must be replaced. We’re going to do that. We’re excited about it . .. We can fix what is broken in health care without breaking what is working in health care,” Ryan said. The Wisconsin Republican said he agrees with Trump’s comment to CBS’ ”60 Minutes” that Obamacare’s laws against barring those with   conditions from receiving coverage and allowing those up to age 26 to remain on their parents’ insurance can stay in place even as the GOP pushes to repeal Obamacare. Ryan said the GOP plans to push refundable tax credits that would allow   Americans to essentially use those tax credits as vouchers to buy insurance, rather than receiving   Medicaid. He demurred when Tapper asked whether insurers would be required to cover birth control at no cost to women    a primary feature of Obamacare    by saying he wasn’t going to discuss ”nitty gritty”   Pressed by Tapper, Ryan said: ”I’m not going to get into hypotheticals about legislation that hasn’t even been drafted yet.”"
Speaker Ryan Moves to Cram Puerto Rico ’Rescue’ Through Divided House - Breitbart,"House Speaker Paul Ryan is keeping his December commitment to Democrat Leader Nancy Pelosi to push for quick action by Congress on a   rescue package for Puerto Rico. [Ryan wants the House Natural Resources Committee to approve legislative language at a committee   on Wednesday, after Ryan and the committee reached a tentative agreement with President Barack Obama.  According to sources on Capitol Hill, the legislation would be rushed to the full House on Thursday, before Congress is scheduled to leave town for its Memorial Day recess. The quick action means the proposed deal that gives Puerto Rico debt relief will not be available for even a full day before the House votes on the deal. The island territory is suffering under a   debt crisis, after amassing more than $70 billion in debt. The island missed a scheduled   earlier this month, when the territory’s legislature passed emergency legislation allowed the Governor to skip debt payments. The island faces a far more challenging $2 billion debt repayment on July 1st. Ryan promised Democrats during the December budget talks that he would help develop an early 2016 rescue for Puerto Rico. After those December budget talks, top Democrats gloated that Ryan ‘gave away the store.’ Little is known about the precise details of the   agreement, except that backers insist the rescue package is not a “bailout” of Puerto Rico. Tuesday afternoon, when the rushed schedule was announced, Speaker Ryan’s office released a list of quotes from selected policy experts and The Washington Post editorial board backing the deal. These quotes, of course, backed the general concept of a rescue package for Puerto Rico. Until the actual legislative text is finalized in committee and ongoing negotiations, it is difficult to determine the precise consequences of the agreements. It does not inspire confidence, however, that the agreement is being rushed through on the eve of a major federal holiday break, leaving few hours for any members to digest the details of the complex agreement."
MILO Explains Why Ugly People Hate Him - Breitbart,"Breitbart Senior Editor MILO explained why ugly people hate him during his talk at the University of Colorado, Boulder, tonight.[  “I’m here tonight to speak about why ugly people hate me  —   and why they hate you too,” declared MILO to the audience. “This could have been a really short presentation, because the answer is simple. They hate me because I am beautiful and tell the truth. Unlike all of the beautiful people in Hollywood who spout liberal lies, gibberish, and fake news to make them feel like better people. ” “But you know me  …     the only thing that gets me off more than the idea of being captured by Somali pirates or being passed around Young Thug’s tour bus is the sound of my own voice,” he continued. “So here we go. ” “Ugly people have always been the leaders of the progressive movement. Just look at the early Temperance Women! They tend to be sexless and joyless people, and nothing makes that kind of person happier than telling other people what they are allowed to do,” MILO explained. “They don’t have joy in their own lives, so why should anyone else? Leftists politics are about policing behavior, nannying people, especially students, and having a hotline to drop the dime on any speech you don’t like. That is a clarion call to every person who wants to get back at the better looking. ” MILO continued to urge students to “Just check out the gender studies professors at any university in America and you will see what I mean,” before claiming that “Liberalism, especially third wave feminism, is the new puritanism. ” “Given America’s obesity epidemic, the truth is that hot people are an endangered species. We are a marginalized group constantly punished by society’s unrealistically ugly beauty standards,” he claimed. “Does no magazine editor ever consider the harm they do to attractive girls’   by putting Lena Dunham or Amy Schumer on their covers?  After quoting New York Times columnist David Brooks on the subject, who claims that “Popular,   and athletic children are the subjects of relentless abuse,” MILO moved onto the subject of female beauty. “A research paper from UCLA proves that women with more feminine features tend to be conservative, while women with more manly features end up liberal,” he declared. “Women that aren’t beautiful are shown by this research to be more likely to take up the ugly politics of progressivism, to retreat from men and to become feminists.  Not the equal pay feminists of the 60s, but the ALL SEX IS RAPE AND MEN ARE PIGS feminists of the current year. ” “Speaking of pigs, here is feminist icon Andrea Dworkin,” announced MILO, displaying a picture of Dworkin on the projector. “Looking at Andrea Dworkin makes you want to ask ‘Who just died’ besides my sex drive, and my appetite?” “This is the prototype for modern feminism. Unattractive women bent on stopping everything they don’t agree with and can’t have, like sexyness and fun,” MILO continued. “Incidentally, the same research doesn’t hold true for men. I guess men have other metrics of value, like their wallet, their speaking ability, and their hair. Some have it all and are even handsome too. I’m speaking of course about myself. ” “Women like Lena [Dunham] and Lindy [West] have no physical beauty, but have built careers on telling fat women they should stay fat so they die early of obesity complications while thinking they are ‘healthy at any size’” he added. ” They are monsters, inside and out. ” Concluding his speech, MILO explained that “Not all beautiful people are conservative, and not all ugly people are liberal. ” “We are individuals and both our appearance and our perception of how we fit in the world’s beauty standards is a core part of our politics,” he claimed. “What makes people lean towards conservatism is the idea that we can make ourselves better. We can always improve in almost every area of our life. I exercise hard and follow a strict haircare regimen because even I want to improve, and I’m practically perfect. Just ask me, I’ll tell you!” “All of you, whether beautiful or ugly, can improve yourselves. Hit the gym, put down that ice cream, maybe even get a nose job or some new tits. I believe in you!” continued MILO. “But liberals take the opposite approach. They find it much easier to pull everyone down and destroy beauty standards, all in the interest of making themselves feel better. Misery loves company, and the Left wants you all to be as miserable as they are. That’s why hot people are being punished  —   because unattractive, mediocre professional losers are allowing their own therapy sessions to leak out onto magazine covers and into movies. ” “Make the decision in your own life to join the beautiful people. Make yourself great again,” MILO concluded. “Conservatives are better looking and have more fun, as we’ve seen together tonight. And by the way, the studies say we’re happier with our sex lives, too. ” Written from prepared remarks. Milo wears tan shirt by UNCL, $55. White women’s suit jacket by Calvin Klein, $60. White jeans by Robin, $550. Limited edition Timberlands, $180. Louis Vuitton belt, $350. Silver Versace shades, $340. Chains and pearls, too much to count.

"Melvin Dwork, Once Cast From Navy for Being Gay, Dies at 94 - The New York Times","When the M. P. s came for him in 1944, Melvin Dwork was in class, a    gay Navy enlisted man in officer candidate school in Charleston, S. C. His companion, under arrest in New Orleans, had given him away. Jailed, found “deviant” by psychiatrists, he was discharged in World War II as “undesirable. ” The word stuck in his craw after the war, an insult that never went away. As years passed, Mr. Dwork became a successful interior designer in New York City, and he and a prominent choreographer were companions for many years. He eventually forgave the man who betrayed him, but not the Navy. In 2011, after years of trying to remove the blot on his record, Mr. Dwork, supported by advocates for gay and lesbian military personnel and veterans, won his point. The Navy officially changed his discharge to honorable. “It meant an awful lot to me because I know I never did anything disgraceful or dishonest,” Mr. Dwork said in a 2014 interview for this obituary, in which he spoke of painful military policies and glacially slow changes toward gay and lesbian service members. Mr. Dwork, who became a hero to gay people for his persistence in fighting the dishonorable discharge, died on Tuesday in Manhattan, Alan Salz, the executor of his estate, said. He was 94. Mr. Dwork was believed to be the first veteran of World War II to have an “undesirable” discharge for being gay expunged, although his case may have opened the floodgates for appeals in hundreds of similar cases. His was resolved shortly before the military ended its    “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, which barred openly gay people from service but prohibited discrimination against those not open about their sexuality. While gay men and lesbians were explicitly barred by the military during World War II, many were quietly admitted to serve, especially in the war’s early stages to meet enlistment quotas, with a tacit understanding that they would be discreet. But later in the war purges rose, and Mr. Dwork and his companion were caught in them. Both men were inducted in 1942 and, in 1943, they joined the Navy hospital corps, which was known to be more tolerant of gays. Mr. Dwork worked at the Naval Hospital at Parris Island, S. C. His partner, whom Mr. Dwork would never publicly identify, went to New Orleans. They exchanged love letters and phone calls, and once had a discreet rendezvous. With excellent work ratings, Mr. Dwork applied for officer candidate school and, in 1944, was accepted for classes at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. Gay friends warned him and his companion to forgo exchanging letters because of the dangers of exposure in campaigns against gays. “We stopped writing, but it was too late,” Mr. Dwork said. At the time of his arrest, he believed that intercepted letters had given them away. He said it was not until many years later that he learned that his partner had been arrested, and had identified Mr. Dwork under the pressure of prolonged interrogations. “I had not taken many classes when the military police came for me,” Mr. Dwork recalled. “They took me to the brig originally, then to the psychiatric brig. They kept me there for weeks. “It was not pleasant, I can tell you that. The doctors were freakish. The psychiatrists were so stupid and asked such stupid questions. It was disgusting. They had no feeling for who I was and why I was there. ” After his discharge, Mr. Dwork returned to New York. He studied at the Parsons School of Design, worked for antiques dealers and from 1956 to 1959 was a partner in   a decorating and antiques concern. He assisted the designer Yale R. Burge in the 1960s and was a design partner of James Maguire in the early 1970s. He then worked independently for many clients, including the RCA chairman Robert W. Sarnoff and the film director Milos Forman. His work was featured in The New York Times, House  Garden, Town  Country and Architectural Digest. In 1993, he was inducted into the Interior Design Hall of Fame. Mr. Dwork said that he and John Butler, a choreographer and former dancer with the Martha Graham Dance Company, were companions and friends from 1961 until Mr. Butler’s death in 1993. After failing on his own to overturn the Navy’s “undesirable” discharge, Mr. Dwork got help from the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, founded in 1993 to fight discrimination against gay and lesbian military personnel affected by the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy. It interceded on his behalf. On Aug. 17, 2011, the Board for Correction of Naval Records in Arlington, Va. changed Mr. Dwork’s discharge to honorable. A record of the proceedings, obtained by The Associated Press, said the Navy had undergone a “radical departure” from its wartime ban on gays. It noted Mr. Dwork’s “exemplary period of active duty” and said it was acting “in the interests of justice. ” Melvin Dwork was born in Kansas City, Mo. on Feb. 9, 1922, one of four children of Henry Dwork and the former Esther Brown. He graduated from Southeast High School in 1939 and attended the Kansas City Art Institute for two years. After moving to New York, he attended the Parsons School in 1941 and 1942. On a summer break, he returned to Kansas City and met his wartime partner. Their plans for a life together were obliterated by the war and their exposure in the crackdown on gay servicemen. Mr. Dwork, who lived in Manhattan, is survived by a brother, Irvin. A documentary on his case, “The Undesirable,” was made by Michael Jacoby. It has not been released. The ruling on Mr. Dwork’s discharge entitled him to veterans benefits, including a military burial. But he said he probably would forgo that honor. Years after Mr. Butler’s death, Mr. Dwork and his wartime partner met to catch up on the passage of six decades. The partner had married and had children, but had never told his family about Mr. Dwork. “He had always denied his sexuality,” Mr. Dwork said. “He didn’t want to be exposed. After all those years in denial, and your own family doesn’t know who you are? I said: ‘Let them know. They’ll love you anyway.’ But he couldn’t do it. I forgave him, but we don’t speak any longer. ”"
"Sessions DOJ Ends ’Holder Memo’ Era, Resumes Strict Drug Sentencing - Breitbart","The Department of Justice announced Friday the end of former Attorney General Eric Holder’s controversial policy preventing certain offenders being charged with crimes that trigger mandatory minimums. [The office of Attorney General Jeff Sessions sent a memorandum titled “Department Charging and Sentencing Policy” to all 93 U. S. Attorney’s offices around the country. As the nation’s leading federal law enforcement official, the Attorney General has the authority to direct charging policy for all DOJ employees. This “Sessions Memo” expressly voids the August 2013, ‘Holder Memo‘ by   General Holder that governed charging decisions until now.  AG Memo on Department Charging and Sentencing Policy by Breitbart News on Scribd,  Most controversially, the Holder Memo forbade federal prosecutors from pursuing charges that would trigger mandatory minimum prison sentences for certain categories of drug offenders, even when prosecutors felt those charges were justified by the facts. Specifically, those caught even with large amounts of drugs were to be charged with less serious offenses that did not trigger mandatory minimums if the defendant was “” not a member of a drug cartel, did not have a long criminal history, and met certain other requirements. It is important to note that, unlike some state systems, most defendants charged with “ ” drug crimes in the federal criminal justice system are not arrested with personal use or even   sale quantities. The Holder Memo became relevant only when federal mandatory minimums for drug offenses kicked in. According to U. S. Sentencing Commission materials the smallest amounts needed to trigger these minimum   sentences were one kilogram of heroin (approximately 10, 000 doses) five kilograms of Cocaine, 280 grams of crack cocaine, or a metric ton of marijuana. Proponents saw the Holder Memo as a “safety valve” for “ ” drug offenders. The memo itself cites the need to reserve mandatory minimum sentences for the highest level of drug offenders and the prosecutor’s role in doing so given federal case law that requires judges follow mandatory minimums enacted by Congress when criminals are convicted under those statutes. Opponents of the Holder Memo felt it demanded federal prosecutors ignore the will of Congress and deliberately circumvent the sentencing structure imposed by the legislature. In this view, U. S. Attorneys were prevented from charging offenses they could readily prove and instead were instructed to conceal from juries the actual amounts of drugs defendants were alleged to have possessed or sold. In any event, the Holder Memo was a radical departure from the previously governing “Ashcroft Memo,” named for its putative author George W.   Attorney General John Ashcroft, which demanded federal prosecutors must, in all criminal cases, charge the most serious offense they had a strong likelihood of proving beyond a reasonable doubt at trial. For example, most people charged with murder could also be charged with manslaughter. Most charged with armed robbery could also be charged with theft. And most of those charged with selling 10 kilograms of drugs could also be charged for selling 1 kilogram of drugs. The Ashcroft Memo, from which Eric Holder departed, forbade U. S. Attorneys from ever charging the lesser included offense and always charging the most serious readily provable offense. Friday’s Sessions Memo reinstates this policy as the default instruction for all federal prosecutors effective immediately. The Sessions Memo, however, is not a mere restatement of the Ashcroft Memo. While the duty to charge the most serious offense is   on line prosecutors, the memo recognizes the need for prosecutorial discretion in certain charging decisions. Only   supervisors such as the 93 U. S. Attorneys and the 12 Assistant Attorneys General may approve deviation from the “most serious offense” requirement. This allows a degree of autonomy and discretion for individual offices not available in the Ashcroft years. This discretion is perhaps most important in securing the cooperation of criminals to bring down larger criminal enterprises. “” whereby prosecutors agree to charge defendants with less harsh sentencing guidelines in exchange for cooperating with the authorities in other investigation, is a powerful “carrot” available to some state prosecutors. The Sessions memo will   that tool to the federal justice system, but only in the hands of   DOJ officials and only when they’ve made their reasoning for doing so clear to the relevant court."

American Wrestler in Mexico Infuriates Fans With Pro-Trump Rants in the Ring - Breitbart,"An American wrestler devised the evilest, most notorious, and meanest persona south of the border to ensure his certain success in Mexico’s professional wrestling league —  Donald Trump. [Sam Adonis says that the idea came to him during the blazing heat of the 2016 presidential campaign.  He observed that “people were so angry,” and thought that if he donned a pair of wrestling tights with an image of Donald Trump on them he would become an instant villain for the Mexican fans who watch the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) professional wrestling promotion.  “Most people here hate Donald Trump without really knowing why,” said the    250 pound Pennsylvania native, whose real name is Samuel Polinsky. “Nobody knows anything about him. They don’t read his policies, or anything he believes. It’s the blind leading the blind. ” According to Yahoo Sports, Adonis strikes an image of a “rudo —  tall, blond and handsome. ” Moreover, he is a throwback to the days of   wrestlers “The Heartbreak Kid” Shawn Michaels and “Mr. Perfect” Curt Hennig. “I’m a flamboyant loudmouth,” Adonis said. “I’m willing to shove my president down your throat. I’m just such an ass that I want to be Trump. I’m the high school quarterback that picked on you. ” Adonis says that he watches “so much wrestling it’s stupid. I’m addicted to ‘80s wrestling. ”  Sam’s dad was a   wrestling promoter and his brother, who goes by Corey Graves, was a great wrestler and spends his time now out of the ring and in the broadcasting box for the WWE. An injury to Sam in 2011 redirected his journey from American to European leagues, and ultimately to Mexico.  “I’d probably be at the top of the game in the WWE [if I stayed healthy],” he said. “Their top guys might not be at the level I am. You can be in the system and not that good. It’s like if a good prospect played basketball in Israel I can be better than LeBron but not seen yet. ” All that being said, Sam Adonis stirs the ire of Mexicans while in the ring. As Yahoo reports, he turns “old jingoism on its head. ”  Standing in the ring, he sings the Star Spangled Banner (poorly) and tells the fans, “This city has the ugliest kids and the poorest men!” He told Mercury News in February, “Wrestlers don’t get enough credit for being masters of human psychology. I know how to take people on an emotional roller coaster, so the fact that I can get people in such a frenzy and control them the way I want to, there’s an artistic pride behind that. ”"
Report suggests potentially alarming development in Jared Kushner’s meeting with the head of a sanctioned Russian bank,"’  ’ ”   The FBI is examining whether Russian   officials suggested to President Donald Trump’s      Jared Kushner, that Russian banks could finance Trump associates’   business ventures if US sanctions were lifted or relaxed,    on   Friday, citing a current US law enforcement official. ” ”   The possibility first came under scrutiny after he meeting came on the heels of Kushner’s   meeting with Russia’s ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak, at   Trump Tower, in which he reportedly  ” ’  ’ ”   Kislyak reportedly orchestrated the meeting between Kushner and   Vnesheconombank CEO Sergey N.

Gorkov was appointed by Russian   President Vladimir Putin in January 2016 as part of a   restructuring of the bank’s management team,    last year. ” ’   Between 2012 and 2014, Vnesheconombank was used as cover for   Russian spy Evgeny Buryakov as he attempted to recruit New York   City residents as intelligence sources for Moscow, according to   the  Before that, Buryakov used   Vnesheconombank as a cover to spy and recruit assets in South   Africa. ’ ’’ ”would have had good reason to push for   the US to lift sanctions:    had huge success between   2007 and 2014, but came crashing down when oil prices tanked and   President Barack Obama levied sanctions on Kremlin officials and   entities over Russia’s annexation of Crimea. ” ’   By February 2016, the bank  —   whose stated official mission is to   ”take efforts to make the Russian economy more competitive,   diversify it, and foster investment”  —   was struggling to find   enough cash to stay afloat.

NumbersUSA Highlights Bill Clinton Talking Like Donald Trump on Immigration - Breitbart,"Hillary Clinton is touting her   policies, so NumbersUSA is out with a new video showing former President Bill Clinton echoing presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump on the topic of immigration. [The video, released by the immigration reduction group Monday on social media, splices clips of former President Clinton’s 1996 State of the Union address with video of Trump speaking about illegal immigration and border security.  “This administration has taken a strong stand to stiffen the protection of our borders,” Bill Clinton says in the   video. Trump follows Clinton’s clip with, “We will build a wall. It will do what it’s supposed to do. Keep illegal immigrants out. ” In another section of the video, Bill Clinton says, “We should honor every legal immigrant here, working hard to be a good citizen But we are also a nation of laws. ” Trump again follows Clinton, “We are a country, we have to have laws. Either we have a country or we don’t,” he says.  Chris Chmielenski, NumbersUSA’s director of content and activism, told Breitbart News that the video was simply made for social media and that currently NumbersUSA does not plan to use it for a larger media campaign. “Our Facebook specialist has been playing around the soundbites from Clinton’s ’96 SOTU [speech] and tried matching it up to some of Trump’s statements,” he wrote in an email to Breitbart News. “When we posted it to Facebook last night, we thought it might do well, but we didn’t think it would get a million views after 12 hours!” he said. “We shared it in some other places  —   Twitter, Reddit, etc.  —   to help it get some legs, but our goal certainly wasn’t to have it picked up by RCP and Drudge,” he said. “That was just a bonus. ”   Real Clear Politics"
Pokemon Trainer Now a Real Life Job with ’Pokemon Go’ - Breitbart,"Many people are already attempting to cash in on the success of real world location based video game Pokemon Go. Some are even attempting to live out their childhood dream by becoming full time professional Pokemon trainers. [A young woman, Alicia Thomas, recently advertised her Pokemon Go training service on Craigslist, where she asked for $20 an hour to capture Pokemon for others. Thomas has been a huge fan of Pokemon since she was young and recently had an article written about her obsession by VICE.   In her Craigslist ad, Thomas briefly describes herself, saying, “Also known as ‘ ’ on sites like 4chan and imgur, I am a    lifelong Pokemon enthusiast who wants to help YOU become the very best. ” Thomas further explains the details of the service she is offering, stating that she will walk around New York city in   hour shifts, collecting Pokemon, activating Poke stops, and helping users hatch their Pokemon eggs.  Thomas further outlines the skills and experience that make her the right choice to expand your Pokedex, “I’m a white female, NYU grad, and a   freelance journalist with a massive Golbat tattoo on my arm. I have been playing Pokemon (both cards and  ) since 1997 and Pokemon GO since its opening day. ”  “I’m in between major projects and have a lot of spare time on my hands right now and also may or may not write an article about this in the future,” she explains. “Personally, I am a level 15 trainer in Pokemon GO right now and control all of the gyms near my place. I know what I’m doing” obviously with skills like these she’s the perfect candidate to wander around the city capturing Pokemon for you. Thomas even agrees to focus on capturing specific classes of Pokemon such as fire, water, electric, etc. and will even send her clients screenshots of the Pokemon she catches and the client’s growing Pokedex. Given the amount of news stories based around Pokemon Go in recent days and the game’s rapidly growing popularity, it’s unsurprising that players have begun to monetize the service. It seems likely that Thomas is just the first of many real life Pokemon trainers.  Lucas Nolan is a Journalism and Media student at Dublin Business School and a regular contributor to Breitbart Tech.

Britain To Have New Prime Minister By September,"Britain should have a new Prime Minister by 2 September, the Conservative Party’s 1922 Committee of backbench MPs has recommended. [The committee, which according to the party’s constitution is responsible for organising the leadership election, said this afternoon that nominations should open on Wednesday and close on Thursday, in a bid to get a new Prime Minister in place as soon as possible.  The election will be held under the same rules as in 2005, when David Cameron was first elected party leader. As the party is now in government, whoever becomes the new leader will by default become Prime Minister. Under the rules, Conservative Members of Parliament will whittle down the number of candidates in a series of ballots, with the   candidate being eliminated after each round of voting. When there are only two remaining candidates, they will go forward to a postal vote of all party members throughout the UK. Former London Mayor Boris Johnson, who played a leading role in the ‘Leave’ campaign, is favourite to win the race, although he has caused concern after indicating the EU freedom of movement rules could still apply after Brexit, and stating there is no rush to begin the formal withdrawal process. Home Secretary Theresa May is second favourite after emerging as the main “stop Boris” candidate. However, she officially backed ‘Remain’ during the referendum campaign, something that may put off many party members from voting for her. Currently third in the betting odds is former Defence Secretary Liam Fox, a senior figure on the right of the party who campaigned for ‘Leave’ and has strong ties with the U. S. Republicans. He may become the   alternative to the increasingly shaky Boris Johnson. The contest was triggered after David Cameron resigned following the victory of Brexit in the EU referendum. He had pledged to serve until October at the latest, but there are increasing calls for a replacement to be elected earlier in order to kick start Britain’s withdrawal from the EU."
Trump is right about media bias," (CNN) Two parties, two different Americas. On Saturday night, the press gathered for the annual White House correspondents’ dinner in Washington where, traditionally, they would roast the president. But this year the punchline was in Pennsylvania, at a rally President Trump held to celebrate his first 100 days in office.  ”I could not possibly be more thrilled,” said Trump, ”than to be more than 100 miles away from Washington’s swamp, spending my evening with . .. much better people.” Thus are the battle lines drawn: the press vs. the president, liberal vs. conservative, Washington vs. the rest of the country.  It sounds compelling, but it’s actually absurd. The press is not the white knight of democracy. The president is not the people’s champion. Let’s start with the press. Trump is right: The correspondents’ dinner is awful. It’s an evening of   bad jokes and political bias, where Democrats go to get praised and Republicans to be lampooned. It was at this dinner where President Obama and ”SNL’s” Seth Myers famously roasted Trump in 2011. A few years later, the joke turned out to be on them. What is the press? It’s conservative, moderate, liberal as objective as possible but sometimes not struggling to survive in the age of the Internet.  Hard to define, in other words    and yet in recent years it has developed a sense of itself, as if it had some unifying political purpose. Choosing Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the men who exposed the Watergate scandal that toppled Richard Nixon, to address the correspondents’ dinner sent a clear message: the press is not only here to hold presidents to account but to bring them down. Were that goal pursued without bias, it would be less controversial. But let’s get real: The press is staffed by human beings, and those human beings have prejudices conditioned by race, class, gender and region.  Politico has crunched the data and claims that the number of Republicans employed in the press is remarkably small. It also notes that as the industry has shrunk it has retreated to New York, Washington and the coastal bastions of the Democratic Party. In 2016, more than half of publishing employees worked in counties that went for Hillary Clinton by over 30%.  Are the values of their geographic and political environments reflected in their reporting? Trump makes it harder to tell. Trump is so outrageous a politician that it’s impossible to judge if the negative press he gets is because he generates it or because journalists go out of their way to dig for it. But there’s no escaping that Woodward and Bernstein were talking to a largely Democrat audience    an audience that believes the necessity of its profession has been sharpened by Trump. They have gone from being the journalists reporting on a war to soldiers fighting in it. The ”enemy,” aka the President, has a big army behind him, and 96% of Trump supporters say they don’t regret their vote last fall. It has only been 100 days, and disappointment takes longer than that to set in    but Trump’s level of support among his base is still surprising given that he has   on many of the policies that won him states like Pennsylvania. Labeling China a currency manipulator is gone. Scrapping NAFTA is gone. Funding for a border wall has been delayed. Reform of Obamacare has been stymied. Far from putting America first in foreign affairs, the President has projected US force into Yemen, Syria and the Korean peninsula.  In fact, after 100 days in office Trump looks less like the populist nationalist that parts of the press paint him as and more and more like a standard Republican    albeit an incompetent one.  What one policy survives as definitional to his presidency? Plans for a massive tax cut that, critics say, will largely benefit the rich and corporations. It will hopefully bring corporate wealth back from overseas and spur job growth in Pennsylvania, but it’s far from the radical overhaul of the economic structure that Trump promised. Trump retains support, however, because he enjoys the same tribal passions that you’ll find within the press. Consider this fascinating statistic: Last year, under Obama, only 39% of Republicans said tax levels were fair. Today the figure is 56%. It could be that simply by having a Republican in the White House, Republicans feel richer already.  So this is American politics, trapped between partisan identities.  Where does the middle lie? It’s harder and harder to find    not because it doesn’t exist but because it is invisible.  If the press won’t speak to it and the parties won’t represent it, there’s a risk that the true world beyond Washington    the world uninterested in both correspondents’ dinners and Make America Great Again rallies    becomes a country apart."
Islamic State Magazine Showcases Caribbean Jihadis,"The latest issue of the Islamic State (ISIS) magazine, Dabiq, features two stories on jihadis based in the Caribbean  —   one an interview, one an obituary  —   encouraging Caribbean islanders to abandon Christianity and join the jihad. In both stories, the jihadis in question boast of having been arrested, investigated, and ultimately released. [ISIS has used Dabiq, an   publication, to highlight world regions that the group hopes to activate as a terror hotspot. In the April edition, Dabiq featured multiple stories on “Bengal,” encouraging Bangladeshi Muslims to join jihadis in Syria and Iraq, and especially to conduct attacks on their native soil. Three months later, Islamic State affiliated jihadists attacked an upscale bakery in the nation’s capital, Dhaka, killing 22 people and injuring another 40 in an extended hostage situation.  That they are now focusing on   Caribbean islands, then, should be of particular concern for regional law enforcement, as these inducements to jihad have a history of encouraging a minority in these regions to act. The fifteenth edition of Dabiq, released Monday, features an interview with a jihadi using the nom de guerre Abu Sa’d  . As his name implies, he left Trinidad and Tobago to join the jihad in Syria and Iraq. Before doing so, he committed numerous acts of jihad in Trinidad and Tobago, but police repeatedly released him during ongoing investigations, allowing him time to leave. “We would work to accumulate money in order to buy weapons and ammo. Alhamdulillah, we were successful in many operations, and this was only by Allah’s grace,”   tells the magazine, noting that he worked with a terror cell in the island nation. “Abu ‘Abdillah [a fellow jihadi] my wife, and I were arrested at one point, but the police weren’t able to make a case against us,” he adds. He and his terror cell members were arrested a second time before being released once again, as they had to commit one last unspecified act of violence before leaving for Syria. Police once again detained and released them. Dabiq claims “a large number of muhajirin from Trinidad and Tobago” are in Iraq and Syria, despite the nation’s overwhelming Christian population. In an obituary piece, Dabiq highlights a pair of jihadi brothers from Canada, while prominently noting their Caribbean origins. Abu ‘Abdillah   and his brother, Abu Ibrahim   were of Jamaican and Guyanese descent, the magazine notes. They, too, were stopped on their way to Syria and ultimately released. Traveling to Egypt to “study,” they were detained on their way east: Abu Ibrahim made up a cover story during the course of the questioning in order to conceal his and his brother’s intentions to perform hijrah and join the mujahidin. When the questioning was over, they made the mistake of having him wait outside the office before they had even called his brother in. This gave him a few precious minutes to tell his brother what they had asked him and how he had responded so that they could coordinate their stories. After Abu ‘Abdillah was questioned they were both released. The stories highlight both the dangers of temporarily releasing jihadi suspects and the growing number of jihadis of Caribbean origin being drawn to the Islamic State. U. S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) has repeatedly warned that the Caribbean and Latin America are the next frontier for jihadi recruiting. “There are a fair amount of Muslims in what were the old English colonies down there [in the Caribbean] Jamaica, and Trinidad, Tobago, a few places like that. Overall, not a huge percentage of the population, but significant,” SOUTHCOM chief Gen. John Kelly said in January, announcing that he had evidence of at least one mosque in the region openly associating with ISIS. American officials estimate at least 150 people have left the region to wage jihad in Syria and Iraq. Last month, a group calling itself Ansar   Brasil pledged allegiance to Islamic State Caliph Abu Bakr   the first group in Latin America to do so. The pledge comes shortly before the nation is set to host the 2016 Olympic Games."
How Emotion Over Pet Care Helps Explain Human Health Spending - The New York Times,"In almost every year since the 1960s, health care spending has grown at least as fast as the overall economy, and often much faster. Health economists have long debated why. Strange as it may sound, how we care for our pets offers some answers. The pet care markets look a little like the market for human health care. Health spending by American households has grown 50 percent between 1996 and 2012. Pet care spending has grown by a similar amount, 60 percent, though from a much smaller base. (Americans spent more than $15 billion on pet health care in 2015, but $3. 2 trillion on human health care.) An estimated 68 percent of households have pets those families with higher incomes spend more, which is also true of human care. And they spend more toward the end of humans’ and pets’ lives alike. The supply of both physicians and of veterinarians has grown at a more rapid rate than overall employment. Since 1996, the number of physicians has grown by about 40 percent. The number of veterinarians is up 100 percent. “These commonalities made us think that something else may be behind the rapid growth in human health care spending,” said Amy Finkelstein, an M. I. T. economist and one of the authors of a recent study on pet care. She, along with her   Liran Einav and Atul Gupta of Stanford, tried to find what that something else could be in their  study on pet health care presented at the American Economic Association annual meeting in Chicago. “We often blame generous insurance and significant public sector involvement, but those are absent from pet care,” Ms. Finkelstein said. Some health economists say generous health insurance and significant government intervention in the health care market promote unnecessary spending. They note the United States spends more of its G. D. P. on health care than other similar advanced economies yet does not exhibit broadly better health outcomes, a sign of inefficiency. But other economists argue that health care is so valuable that we might reasonably spend even more on it than we do today. Which camp is right? The three economists pointed out that, in contrast with the market for human health care, there is much less government involvement in pet care. Pet health insurance is also much less common. More than 90 percent of Americans now have health insurance, an industry that has been with us since before World War II. But only 1 percent of dogs and cats are insured for pet care, a relatively new product. (According to the North American Pet Health Insurance Association, the first pet health insurance policy in the United States was written for Lassie, the TV dog star, in 1982.) So the economists’ focus turned to the commonalities. Human and pet health care are both provided by experts  —   doctors and veterinarians  —   who’ve undergone lengthy and expensive training and occupational licensing. That expertise commands high salaries. It also gives them the authority to recommend treatments and tests, the need for which most consumers cannot independently judge. You trust your vet as you would trust your doctor to do what is best, especially when an emotional decision is being made. Both human and pet health care are accompanied by strong emotions, making it hard to rationally weigh the value of options. Moreover, the need for care, whether it is for a pet or a human, is difficult to predict and often urgent, again threatening our ability and willingness to shop for the best deals. Technology plays a role, too. Complex procedures, new pharmaceuticals and   imaging, which drive human health care spending, are no longer uncommon in pet care, increasing those costs. Though routine veterinary visits might cost pet owners only a couple of hundred dollars per year, a serious condition can be very expensive. A dog’s kidney transplant can run $25, 000, and a cat’s cancer treatment can cost $10, 000 or more. Even if such high costs are extremely rare, it is not as uncommon for a pet owner to encounter a $2, 000 to $4, 000 bill at some point, particularly near the end of a pet’s life. “It makes you think that the emotional nature of the treatment decision may be important in explaining high and sometimes heroic    health care spending,” Ms. Finkelstein said, “whether on your dog or on your mother. ” If emotions are in fact driving the higher spending, will it hasten the trend toward more pet insurance? The pet health insurance industry is growing, with total premium volume up about 17 percent in each of the last two years. It’s one of the   employee benefits Delta Air Lines,   Microsoft, U. P. S. and Xerox now offer it. The most common policies cover care for injuries due to accidents, as well as care for illnesses like arthritis or cancer, with monthly premiums starting around $22 for dogs and $16 for cats. But premiums can be higher depending on breed, age and where you live. Some other policies also cover preventive care, like vaccinations. In general, plans won’t cover   conditions, pregnancy and   costs, or animals less than a couple of months old. Typically owners pay 20 percent of treatment costs, with plans picking up 80 percent, though some insurers offer other   options. Is pet insurance a good deal? Consumer Reports explored its value last year and concluded it’s typically not worth the price. Only if your pet has very high care costs will insurance pay out more than you would pay in premiums. According to analysis by Ms. Finkelstein and her Stanford colleagues, nearly   of all pet care costs is spent by just 20 percent of households with pets. This guarantees that most policyholders won’t get back what they pay in. This is true of human health insurance, too, and for the same reason. But the point of health insurance  —   whether for humans or their pets  —   is to protect against the risk of catastrophically high costs, not to make money. Consumer Reports suggests an alternative when it comes to pet care:  . Many pet owners could probably build up several thousand dollars in an emergency fund that could be used to help cushion the blow of unusually high pet care costs. Saving enough to weather a serious, human medical condition that could cost tens of thousands of dollars year after year or more is not something most Americans could do. Though you might reasonably avoid pet care insurance, you really can’t do that with human health insurance. Human and pet health care may have some commonalities, but this isn’t one of them."
Hillary Clinton Receives Ovation at ‘The Color Purple’ - The New York Times,"Hillary Clinton, who has kept a relatively low public profile since losing the presidential election two months ago, on Sunday showed up at the final performance of the Broadway revival of “The Color Purple,” reveling in the story of a beleaguered woman who triumphs over the oppressive men in her life (and, along the way, discovers a love for colorful pants). Mrs. Clinton, accompanied by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and their daughter, Chelsea, received several ovations from the   audience as she arrived, and then another round of applause when she was acknowledged by the cast after the show. “There’s a lot of really awesome famous and notable people here today,” the actress Patrice Covington, who gave the farewell speech on behalf of the cast after the show, said to the audience. “I’m not going to call all of them out  —   I know you already know them,” she said, before pausing, looking in Mrs. Clinton’s direction, and waving at her mischievously. At that, the audience erupted into a new, loud round of applause. The reaction was substantially warmer than the scattered booing and clapping that greeted the arrival of Vice   Mike Pence when he attended “Hamilton,” just one block north, on Nov. 18. “We love you Hillary,” some audience members shouted. Several thanked Mrs. Clinton and told her, “God bless you. ” “God bless you,” Mrs. Clinton replied. Mrs. Clinton was besieged by   before the show, at intermission and as she was ushered out a side door after the musical ended (“Whoa!” said her husband as they left.) Jordan Serpone, 33, an audience member from Boston, said that spotting Mrs. Clinton was a surprisingly moving experience for him. “I was having every emotion I’ve tried to get rid of over the past few weeks,” he said during intermission. He shook her hand, but said he is still filled with frustration over her loss. “She shouldn’t be here. She should be planning her cabinet,” he said. Because the Sunday matinee was the last performance for the acclaimed production, which won last year’s Tony award for best musical revival, the crowd was starry: Among those in the audience were Jonathan Groff, Mariska Hargitay, Gayle King, Debra Messing, Leslie Odom Jr. Billy Porter, Phylicia Rashad and Anna Wintour. Public sightings of Mrs. Clinton in the weeks since the election have been sufficiently rare that they create a stir on social media. Strangers have sought photographs with her at stores and in the woods near her home in Chappaqua, N. Y. But Mrs. Clinton has indicated that she and her husband plan to attend the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as president on Jan. 20. “The Color Purple” tells the searing story of a young black woman abused by her stepfather and her husband in rural Georgia in the early 20th century. The musical is an adaptation of a   1982 novel, by Alice Walker, which was awarded the 1983 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Steven Spielberg adapted the novel into a film in 1985, and Oprah Winfrey, who was featured in the film, went on to become an important champion, and   of the musical. The musical has been one of the most successful at attracting black audiences to Broadway. It first opened on Broadway in 2005, and features a book by Marsha Norman and music and lyrics by Stephen Bray, Brenda Russell and Allee Willis. The revival, which opened in 2015 and was directed by John Doyle, featured a   performance by the British actress Cynthia Erivo. She won a Tony award for best actress in a leading role in a musical. The last show took place on Ms. Erivo’s 30th birthday."
Islamic State Labors to Create Image of Business as Usual as International Forces Close in on Strongholds,"As Iraqi and international forces make preparations ahead of a final offensive on Mosul, the Islamic State’s stronghold in Iraq, and Russian forces continue their assault on Raqqa, IS’s Syrian “capital,” the radical organization’s propaganda apparatus is apparently trying to maintain an image of business as usual in its   fiefdom. [IS published pictures of busy markets, stoning of suspected prostitutes, execution of a suspected traitor (above) and amputation of the legs of those who committed “immorality. ”  In the   Dijla region in Iraq, four suspected prostitutes were pictured being stoned in what the organization called “a religious commandment. ” In the pictures, an IS operative is seen standing next to a pile of rocks and reading out the “indictment” in front of an angry mob, while the bystanders are then invited to stone the convicts, probably to death.  Similar pictures from Raqqa show the execution of a presumed collaborator with the   coalition or “the Crusader coalition” in IS’s words. Here too, after being read the “sentence” in front of an angry mob, the convict is crucified and stabbed in his chest, then shot in the head.  After the crucifixion, the body of the deceased is left hanging with a sign attached to him, saying: “This is the spy Muhamad Adnan, who gave away information about houses and military barracks with a view of having them bombed and their Muslim dwellers killed. ” In pictures emanating from Afghanistan’s Khorasan region, which is partly controlled by IS, the organization’s members are seen amputating the limbs of men suspected of “disturbing the peace on earth. ” It is unclear what offense they committed, but they were punished “in keeping with Sharia law,” the statement said.  But in Mosul, the “capital of the caliphate” in Iraq, IS labors to emphasize that life goes on as usual with pictures of the city’s busy markets, whose stalls are filled with fresh produce.  "
Ellen DeGeneres: Trump Not Welcome On My Show,"Daytime talk show host Ellen DeGeneres says President Donald Trump is not welcome on her show. [In an interview with Today host Matt Lauer Thursday, DeGeneres was asked if she would ever invite the president on her show for an interview, as she did with former president Barack Obama and former 2016 presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton.  “Um, no,” she said. “Because I’m not going to change his mind. ” “He’s against everything that I stand for,” the Ellen host further explained. “We need to look at someone else who looks different than us and believes in something that we don’t believe in and still accept them, and still let them have their rights. ” Obama twice guested on DeGeneres’   show once in 2011 and again last February. Elsewhere in her interview, the talk show host revealed that after she came out as gay  —   20 years ago on her 90s show Ellen  —   she could not find work in Hollywood for three years.  The    criticized the president’s refugee policy earlier this year on social media. “For me, America is great because of all the people who came here. Not in spite of them,” DeGeneres tweeted to her 65 million Twitter followers, along with the hashtag #NoBan: For me, America is great because of all the people who came here. Not in spite of them. #NoBan,  —   Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) January 29, 2017,  P. S. My grandparents were immigrants. The woman making us pizza right now is Muslim. And I’m grateful for all of them. #NoBan,  —   Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) January 29, 2017,  DeGeneres piled on the president again a few days later on her show, using the plot of her animated movie Finding Dory to slam Trump’s travel order. “If you haven’t heard, this is what happened over the weekend: On Friday, the president gave an order banning people from seven countries from entering the United States, including people with green cards. Then on Saturday, the President screened Finding Dory at the White House,” DeGeneres said. “I don’t get political, but I will say that I am against one of those two things. ” “Finding Dory is about a fish named Dory. Dory lives in Australia, and these are her parents, and they live in America. And I don’t know what religion they are, but her dad sounds a little Jewish. It doesn’t matter,” said DeGeneres, who voiced the title character in the Disney film.  “Dory arrives in America with her friends Marlin and Nemo. She ends up at the Marine Life Institute behind a large wall. They all have to get over the wall, and you won’t believe it, but that wall has almost no effect in keeping them out,” she continued. “Even though Dory gets into America, she ends up separated from her family, but the other animals help Dory —  animals that don’t even need her, animals that don’t have anything in common with her. They help her, even though they’re completely different colors because that’s what you do when you see someone in need you help them,” DeGeneres said. “So that is what I hope everyone who’s watching Finding Dory has learned. ”   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson"
Police chief on 911 tape: I shot my wife in my sleep," (CNN) The police chief in an upscale community outside Atlanta said he was sleeping when he moved a gun in the bed and accidentally shot his wife in the back, according to a 911 tape released Friday. ”Who shot her?” the 911 operator asked William McCollom, the police chief in Peachtree City, Georgia. ”Me,” McCollom replied. ”How did you shoot her?” ”The gun was in the bed, I went to move it, put it to the side, and it went off,” McCollom said. ”Is she awake?” ”No, everybody was sleeping,” McCollom said. ”No, is she awake now?” ”Yes,” he said. Later in the call, the operator asked McCollom, ”Were you asleep also when this happened?” ”Yes,” he said.   Wife in critical condition, Margaret McCollom, 58, was listed in critical condition Friday at Atlanta Medical Center, according to the hospital. William McCollom, 57, has not been charged with a crime, but he has been put on administrative leave while the shooting is investigated by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.  McCollom started out the 911 call by describing the problem: ”Gunshot wound, accidental, need medical ASAP.” He made the call to 911 about 4 a. m. Thursday. He didn’t mention he was the top law enforcement officer in the town of 35, 000 people until the 1:50 mark in the   recording. The 911 operator asked where the gun was located. At first McCollom said he didn’t know, then said, ”I’m the chief of police. The gun is on the dresser.” ”You’re the chief of police in Peachtree City?” the operator asked. ”Yeah, unfortunately, yes,” McCollom said. ’Come on, guys, get here’ In a statement released Friday, the GBI said: ”Chief McCollom has been cooperating with GBI agents working the investigation.  Ms. McCollom will be interviewed when her medical condition improves. When the GBI completes the investigation, it will be turned over to Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard.” At one point in the recording, the operator asked, ”Is that her crying?” A woman’s moans can be heard in the background. ”Yes, she’s having trouble breathing,” McCollom said. At another point, McCollom addresses his wife, ”Are you having trouble breathing, dear?” ”Come on, guys, get here,” he says while waiting for the police and ambulance. ”Oh my god, how did this happen?” When the police arrive, McCollom can be heard telling them the gun is on the dresser. The 911 operator ended the call. Authorities aren’t revealing many details, but said in a Thursday press conference that McCollom shot his wife with his service Glock 9mm. McCollom told the 911 operator he had shot his wife twice, but the GBI said investigators determined she’d only been shot once. Peachtree City known for golf carts, McCollom was named the police chief in October after being interim chief for three months, reported CNN affiliate WSB. Peachtree City posted this statement on the city website: ”City Manager Jim Pennington said, ’This morning, I met with every department manager, and the city of Peachtree City, including the Peachtree City Police Department, is continuing with normal operations.’  Peachtree City Mayor Vanessa Fleisch said, ’Our thoughts and prayers are with Maggie and the McCollom family right now, as we wait for the state investigation to proceed.’ ” Magazines and websites regularly rank Peachtree City as one of the best places to live and raise a family. The community’s trademark: Residents putter around in golf carts on the community’s   miles of paved pathways."
"Erik Prince: Clinton’s ‘Foreign Policy Record Is a Disaster,’ Trump Is ‘Willing to Take a Different Direction’ - Breitbart","Retired Navy SEAL and former Blackwater CEO Erik Prince thought it was “shocking indeed that Matt Lauer asked any question that wasn’t   from the Clinton team” during Wednesday night’s national security forum. [“I think perhaps the lies, the distortions have reached a tipping point, that the rest of the media is saying, we can’t be this dishonest all the time on these matters, we have to do something right,” Prince told Breitbart    Alex Marlow on Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM.  He thought Trump was stronger on content during the forum, because “Hillary doesn’t have anything to be strong on,  . ” “Her foreign policy record is a disaster, whether it’s being part of pulling out of Iraq, basically when the war had been won and the country had been stabilized, all that blood and treasure and effort, literally thrown down the drain by the Obama Administration,” Prince said.  “And then her leading a cavalry charge into Libya, to cause what was a cooperating state on   they’d given up their nuclear weapons, and she turned it into an Islamic fascist kinda   that is still melting down  —   a transit point for millions of refugees a year, thousands of which drowned, people being beheaded, Coptic Christians being murdered, the list of terribles. So she has no record to go on,” he pronounced. Prince agreed with a caller that Trump could do more with Hillary Clinton’s sale of American uranium reserves to Russia, calling the story “an   question, certainly by the mainstream media. ” “Clinton Cash does an excellent job of covering it. Unfortunately, enough of America hasn’t seen it yet,” he said. “To elaborate, due to a significant donation into the Clinton Foundation, the State Department ended up approving the sale of a company that owns 20% of the uranium in the United States, certainly a strategic fuel stock for us here, for nuclear energy production, and of course for nuclear weapons, if necessary. It’s now in the hands of a Russian state enterprise. ” Marlow asked for Prince’s take on Donald Trump’s   call for “taking the oil” after an operation such as the Iraq War. During the Wednesday night forum, Trump more specifically called for seizing oil production before the Islamic State could take it. “The caliphate, ISIS, operates with legitimacy in their minds because they control land,” Prince noted. “That land they control holds oil. They sell that oil, they sell it off  —   oddly enough, by truck, to Erdogan’s son, the ruler of Turkey, so that even the Erdogan family is in on the criminal enterprise of it all. But when he says ‘take the oil,’ if friendly forces occupy that territory, that oil is no longer available to the enemy for sale. ”  He said that holding land even allows ISIS to run its own science programs, since they have “taken over the University of Mosul, their science department, and they are using it as a weapons lab for doing research on weapons that will evade detection in the West. ” “You have to take away any legitimacy that the caliphate has by owning or controlling land. They cannot have a state,” he urged. “Doing so will cut off a major part of their money supply. They would still get money, like   does, via some    radical Islamist donors, and there’s other ways to deal with that, but you have to take away the legitimacy of the caliphate, by denying them sanctuary anywhere. That’s going to take them from   units that can go from battalions, up to even brigade size, thousands of people, down to at least operating at no more than   to   terror cells. ” “It was interesting in the forum last night, Hillary saying ‘I will never use U. S. ground troops,’ and she’s going to try to phone it in from the air  —   clearly a strategy that hasn’t been working for the last two and a half years, because ISIS is still very active, and still ever as deadly,” Prince said. “Whether you use U. S. ground forces, whether you use local Arab forces, or whether you use contracted forces, it’s not that difficult to assemble a force  —   a few thousand people, we’re not talking tens of thousands. If you give it to the conventional military, they will insist on tens of thousands, just because they move with a much, much larger logistics footprint,” he said. “If you think about, what was the most effective response the U. S. has had to terrorism, I would say it was the first 12 months after   where you had a few case officers, a handful of special operations officers, supported by capable air and agency air, and it literally turned the Taliban back in a matter of weeks. ” “The U. S. military’s war plan, going back to   was basically bombs, missile raid, and a ranger raid for the first six months. They didn’t want to put any significant boots on the ground until the following April, of 2002, and this is while their headquarters, the Pentagon, was still smoking under attack,” Prince recalled. “A light, unconventional, again contracted or indigenous force, ought to roll up and destroy any conventional pockets of ISIS, in the entire   theater. ”  “You have to negotiate a deal with what Syria looks like,   with Putin,” he continued. “You know, the Alawites, the Assad family are from the Alawite tribe, that’s a Shia minority. He can’t leave, because if he does, the Alawites will be slaughtered. A Shia minority being in charge in Syria is almost like the untouchables running India  —   it just doesn’t happen. So it’s been that way for 40 years, and you have to separate them, because those two are in a blood feud, and unless they have a very clear boundary, they’re going to continue to fight. ” “You have to basically have the Russians and Assad be willing to shrink the footprint of what Assad’s going to run, and I would take eastern Syria, western Iraq, and put it into a greater Sunni country, call it Sunnistan,” he proposed. “Give the Kurds, who have been our most steadfast allies, fighting against Daesh and radicalism there, give them their own homeland. With that, you could actually have a homeland for Christians, because Christianity’s been in the Middle East for longer than Islam, for the past 2, 000 years. And they have largely been run out of Dodge by continued attacks and violence. ” On the matter of giving Christians a homeland, Prince said there will be a conference called “In Defense of Christians” in Washington this very weekend. He talked about how the maps of modern Iraq and Syria were drawn by the   treaty in 1916, and that old world has “gone away. ” He advised drawing a new map along “tribal and religious lines,” and then allowing good borders to make good neighbors. Prince said the persecution of Christians draws relatively little media coverage in the United States because “when you have very few people who believe anymore here, who are in those positions of writing, it’s easy for them to ignore. ”  Meanwhile, in the Middle East, Christians find themselves in a “war of tribal extinction, where you have ISIS rolling into a village, lining everyone up, and asking them what they believe. You’ve even seen other cases of that in Somalia, or Nigeria, or wherever, where radical Islamist terrorists are lining up people and murdering them, if they can’t recite lines from the Koran. ” Prince predicted Trump would “have his hands full” if he became   . “He’s gonna have a military bureaucracy that needs massive reform,” he said. “When you throw hundreds of billions of dollars onto an organization, year after year after year, it creates a lot of bad habits, it creates a lot of fat. It makes for a very heavy triathlete that’s going to have a hard time bobbing, and moving, and flexing, and moving quickly to fight   actors. ” Prince said of Hillary Clinton’s position, “There’s no there there. ” “To announce that you’re never going to use ground troops is wrong. It means basically to ISIS saying, yes, we can sit back and tear away at these Americans, because they’re afraid to commit their people to come and get us,” he said. “Her position is untenable. It’s just saying well, we’re going to get our Arab allies to do more. ” “There’s no there there,” he repeated. “You’re not going to trust the Turks. The Turks’ main interest is in destroying the Kurds. Remember, Turkey was a major transit point  —   and still is  —   for ISIS fighters and weapons, et cetera. It’s a mess that someone’s going to have to go clean out. ” “You’re not going to get Saudi Arabia to send troops,” he continued. “They’re being destroyed left, right, and center along their southern border in Yemen. Jordan is pretty much tapped out. And so there’s not a lot of other real military capability in the Middle East. ” He recalled the CIA’s use of indigenous forces after   “led by CIA officers, supported by American air power,” and suggested Trump tap the same kind of intelligence teams to conduct a similar strategy against the Islamic State on the ground, combining “cash, authority, and a real will to fight. ” “DOD can support that, but it must be an   effort,” Prince specified. “If I were in the Trump Administration, I would say that the Pentagon does not have a leading role to play, battling   actors. It should be an intelligence function. The Pentagon, as Mr. Trump laid out, needs to beef up its conventional military capabilities, which have been eroded and chewed up, trying to fight basically guys with pickup trucks, with our   very expensive military equipment. ” Instead, he advised using “other guys in pickup trucks” to combat these   irregular forces, adding “a few elements of technology to give your side the advantage. ” “You focus on going cheap,” Prince said. “This is the Long War. This is not an invasion of Grenada that’s going to be done in five days. This is a long,   long and   fight, and you have to provision and plan to fight the enemy, to be able to outlast them. When the Pentagon gets involved, and you start rolling blocks of 10, 000 people in, it comes at an enormous cost. That’s why we’re still spending $44 billion a year in Afghanistan, and right now the Taliban controls more land in Afghanistan then they did on   15 years ago. ” “To go at this the same way it’s been done is the definition of insanity, because we keep going around and around in circles,” he said of Hillary Clinton’s   agenda. “Again, the most effective time the U. S. had against terrorism was about the first year,    and the more the Pentagon got involved, and the more battalions of lawyers and bureaucrats got involved, everything slowed down, and all progress stopped. ” In response to a caller who had military experience in Iraq, Prince talked about the restrictive rules of engagement and burdensome   policies imposed on U. S. troops, pronouncing them too cumbersome for dealing with a vicious irregular enemy. He cited legendary military theorist Carl von Clausewitz’s idea that military courage comes in two forms: the individual courage of the soldier, which the U. S. has a “surplus” of, thanks to our “fantastic soldiers, NCOs, and junior officers. ” “The other kind of courage it takes are senior leaders that are willing to commit their people to action, with an uncertain outcome,” he said. “I think that’s what we’ve suffered from. We’ve built up this massive barrier mentality when we’re trying to engage with the enemy, and it prevents effective action. ” For example, he said that “if you’re fighting in Afghanistan, you have to call a U. S. lawyer sitting in an   office in Qatar, at some U. S. Air Force base, to get permission to drop a bomb. ” “That’s wrong. That is a   way to fight a war,” he declared. “To me, that’s disqualifying for Hillary, because that’s what she would default to,” Prince said. “I think Mr. Trump is willing to take a different direction. He’s listening to some different voices on this, and who knows what that would look like, but I have way more confidence in Mr. Trump doing the right thing than Hillary. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.

"In riven nation, here’s who gets my vote"," (CNN) In the span of one month, like so many of you, I have been   by senseless killings that have affected the gay community, the black community and the law enforcement community. I have sat through endless hours of TV coverage, learning the names and stories of the dead. The 49 victims at Pulse Nightclub in Orlando.  Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Philando Castile in Minnesota. Five officers of the law in Dallas: Brent Thompson, Patrick Zamarripa, Michael Krol, Michael Smith and Lorne Ahrens.  I am not gay. I am not black. And I am not in law enforcement. I am American. And each one of those deaths was sad and outrageous and shocking to me. We are all in this together. We must do better as a country. We must do better as a society. We must do better as individuals. Doing anything less is not an option. All these deaths appear to share one thing in common. Hatred. Bigotry. That conscious or subconscious suspicion that comes from perceiving others as different from us. Gay lives matter. Black lives matter. Blue lives matter. All lives matter. I refuse to accept or believe that I have to choose one above the other. I refuse to believe we need to take sides.  Labels don’t matter to the parent that has to bury a child. Color doesn’t matter to spouses who became widows or children who became orphans in an instant. What matters is that they will never be whole again. They will never again hug    or listen to the voice of    the person they loved. Every holiday will be marred by the void left now someone is missing. These senseless deaths are a personal tragedy to those who knew and loved the victims.  But they are even more than that. They are also a national tragedy.  We are at a crossroads as a nation. We have allowed ourselves to become polarized. We have fallen prey to the politics of division. We proudly declare ourselves independent of political correctness and think that means letting our most negative feelings roam free.  Civility and common courtesy is viewed by some as a sign of weakness. Some Americans feel under attack and in turn, go on the attack. We often only listen to, watch, and read opinions we agree with and discount different opinions as propaganda. Too often, we surround ourselves only by people who look like us and think like us and act like us. Folks, thoughts and prayers will only take us so far. We must do more. This month of tragic bloodshed and violence should serve as a   call for Americans. Let’s each look deep into ourselves and recognize our faults. Have we been part of the problem? Have we been mere spectators? Can we be part of the solution? In moments like these, leaders often call for ”national dialogue.” Here’s a thought: Let’s start with individual dialogue. Let’s talk to each other. Let’s listen to each other. Let’s respect each others’ differences and diversity.  I live in Miami, an urban city where people of different colors, nationalities and creeds coexist. It isn’t always easy.  Work takes me all over the country. I get to meet all types of people. I often find myself explaining the immigrant experience    leaving your home country, learning a new language and customs, being adopted by America and loving it as your own.  I have spent countless hours listening to   friends talk about what it was like to grow up black and often poor in America. Every single black friend I know has given or received ”the talk” on how to act    and how not to act    if stopped by police. Every single one. Some of my black friends are famous, rich and powerful. Some are average Joes and Janes. Regardless of who they are, they have had ”the talk” with their kids.  I never did. Nobody in my family ever did. None of my classmates ever did. I grew up assuming that all police officers are decent, good people, risking their lives to protect me. I never, ever feared that a simple traffic violation would end up in more than a citation. The black experience is different.  The truth is, the vast majority of cops are out there to do good. But racism, racial profiling and abuse still exist in our country. It is not a figment of black imagination. We cannot be blind to it. And we cannot pretend it started just recently, with the advent of readily accessible video phones. Join us on Facebook. . I have also had many conversations with first responders    men and women who put their lives at risk daily, so that the rest of us may be safer. Most people in law enforcement sign onto the job because they want to improve their community. They want to make it a safer place for their children and other people’s children.  Let us never forget the thousands and thousands of police officers who’ve died or are wounded in the line of duty. We owe it to those who’ve made the ultimate sacrifice to recognize that though there are exceptions, police forces are predominantly made up of good people with a vocation to serve and protect. Let’s also talk a little about ”the blame game.” No, conservative leaders who condemn homosexuality are not to blame for the death of 49 people at Pulse. A   radicalized, bigoted madman is.  No, Donald Trump and his divisive rhetoric is not to blame for the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. A few police officers are. No, President Obama is not to blame for the hunting of Dallas police, which led to the death of five of them. A deranged man full of hatred and misguided vengeance is.  But words do matter. The character of our leaders matter. As we head to the polls this November, we will be electing our local, state and national representatives. I for one, am going to vote for those that lead us forward, not backwards. I am going to vote for those who help us find the best in ourselves, not the worst in others.  I am going to vote for those that advocate unity and optimism, not stoke division and fear. There is a lot that each of us can do to heal the racial divide and our national wounds. Our individual actions, our words, our attitude, and our vote     can all make a difference."
Dem Operative Khizr Khan Calls on John McCain to Renounce Trump,"Khizr Khan, the Gold Star    operative who berated Donald Trump from the podium at the Democratic National Convention last month, is calling on Sen. John McCain ( ) to renounce the Republican presidential nominee. [Cronkite News interviewed Khan:  “I implore Sen. McCain   …     I continue to implore all of the good Republicans who either support or are going to vote for their party’s candidate, this will be a historic moment in the Republican Party,” Khan said Tuesday during an interview with Cronkite News. “If you publicly rebuked him, you will look back and you will stand tall in front of the nation and you will say you were not for this, we were for (a) better America,” he said.   …     Khan said McCain and other GOP leaders need to take their repudiation of Trump and his remarks one step further. “They don’t want to have that burden on their conscience,” Khan said. “That was the time to speak. This is the time to stand for whatever they want to stand. ” Curiously, Khan had not made any of his feeling about Trump known to the media, or in a   forum, until he and his wife appeared onstage at the Democratic Party’s convention in Philadelphia. Khan has not said anything about Hillary Clinton’s treatment of the bereaved Benghazi parents, two of whom are suing her for defamation after she told them a YouTube video was to blame for their sons’ deaths, then lied about having done so and said that they had remembered conversations with her incorrectly. Reports have emerged that Khan is now being recruited to run for office in Virginia, with fundraising efforts already under way. Democrats have long used McCain to exploit differences among Republicans, beginning with the 2000 election, when McCain was George W. Bush’s main rival.

"‘Keep an Eye on Him,’ Ahmad Khan Rahami’s Father Says He Told F.B.I. - The New York Times","The father of the man accused of carrying out bombings last weekend in New York and New Jersey said that, two years ago, he warned federal agents explicitly about his son’s interest in terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda and his fascination with jihadist music, poetry and videos. In a series of interviews with The New York Times on Wednesday and Thursday, Mohammad Rahami, whose son Ahmad Khan Rahami has been charged with using weapons of mass destruction and bombing a place of public use, recounted his interactions with the Federal Bureau of Investigation after he raised his concerns about his son. While Mr. Rahami has spoken briefly about his contact with the F. B. I. the interviews this week provided his most detailed public account so far. His description of that contact differs starkly from the one given by law enforcement officials, who on Thursday challenged the father’s account, saying he did not provide the F. B. I. with many of the details about his son that he now says he did. Mr. Rahami’s contact with the authorities began in August 2014, when the local police in Elizabeth, N. J. responded to the family’s home after a domestic dispute in which Ahmad stabbed his brother, according to court records. Law enforcement officials familiar with the case who would discuss it only on the condition of anonymity said that Mr. Rahami called his son a “terrorist” when talking to local police, which led to the F. B. I. ’s involvement. Mr. Rahami said that during the course of the investigation he told agents from the bureau everything he knew about his son’s activities. “I told the F. B. I. to keep an eye on him,” he said. “They said, ‘Is he a terrorist?’ I said: ‘I don’t know. I can’t guarantee you 100 percent if he is a terrorist. I don’t know which groups he is in. I can’t tell you. ’” But he said he had laid out his concerns, specifically related to what he described as his son’s emerging infatuation with Islamic extremism. “The way he speaks, his videos, when I see these things that he listens to, for example, Al Qaeda, Taliban, he watches their videos, their poetry,” he said he told the federal agents. In the interviews, the elder Mr. Rahami spoke about his son’s admiration of Anwar   who was once Al Qaeda’s leading propagandist and is popular with followers of the Islamic State, and also recalled that his son watched Mr. Awlaki’s videos. The F. B. I. in a statement earlier this week, said it had conducted an assessment of Ahmad Rahami that included interviews with his father, a review of bureau databases and public records, and checks with other agencies. The assessment did not turn up anything that warranted further inquiry, and the matter was closed, the agency said. A senior law enforcement official familiar with the assessment said that “During its assessment on Ahmad Rahami, the F. B. I. initiated contact with his father, who had expressed concern over his son’s internet use as well as some of his associates. Ahmad Rahami’s travel revealed no information that tied him to terrorism” “At no time,” the official said, “did the father advise interviewing agents of any radicalization or alleged links to Al Qaeda, the Taliban or their propaganda. Furthermore, database and interagency checks, to include reviews of Ahmad Rahami’s travel, revealed no information that tied him to terrorism. ” When agents first interviewed the elder Mr. Rahami on Aug. 26, they asked him about his comments to the local police, according to some of the officials. The father told them that he was referring to gangsters and criminals, not terrorists, the officials said. But Mr. Rahami’s father told the F. B. I. that he had walked by his son’s room and observed him watching a YouTube video of explosions, the officials said. It was unclear what kind of explosions were in the video. On Sept. 12, 2014, the F. B. I. returned and told the father that his son had been cleared of any connection to terrorism, and on Sept. 19, the review was formally closed. The father said he was not surprised by the F. B. I. ’s findings. He repeated that his son was not a terrorist but had been hanging out with “bad people,” officials said. When told on Thursday that law enforcement officials contradicted his version of events, he said, “It’s a lie,” and that he stood by his account. Law enforcement officials said that investigators did not interview Ahmad Rahami because he was in jail when the F. B. I. was conducting its review. If he was represented by a lawyer, agents would have had to request an interview through the lawyer. It is unknown whether such a request was made, and it is far from certain that a lawyer would have agreed. By the time Ahmad Rahami was released from jail, the F. B. I. had concluded its review. “They didn’t do their job,” his father said in one of the interviews with The Times, which were conducted in his native language, Pashto. John Miller, deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism for the New York Police Department, outlined the challenges facing agents as they investigate such cases  —   especially given the number of people they look into and the threshold that must be met to take action. “If you have that many contacts with that many people over that period of time, it’s increasingly likely that the next time something happens, it’s going to involve somebody that you knew, heard about, investigated, bumped or otherwise checked out,” Mr. Miller said on Wednesday at a congressional hearing about the bombings. “Now, that’s a good thing in that, when you’re assessing who to look at first and they come up in those records, it gives you a basis to go forward. It’s also a liability in that people have somewhat of a misconception about our ability to put someone under surveillance, leave them there indefinitely. ” The F. B. I. ’s assessment of Ahmad Rahami was the second time he had to the attention of the federal authorities. Five months earlier, in March 2014, when he returned from a nearly yearlong trip to Pakistan, Mr. Rahami was flagged by customs officials, who pulled him aside for a secondary screening. Still concerned about his travel, officials notified the National Targeting Center, a federal agency that assesses potential threats, two law enforcement officials said. That report was reviewed by the F. B. I. when it conducted its assessment of Mr. Rahami in August. It is not known how much detail the report contained about Mr. Rahami’s activity while he was overseas. Investigators are focused on the time that he spent abroad and are looking into whether he received any training in   and whether he is connected to any wider terrorist network. “His travels give us these two distinct choices, both of which are bad,” said a senior counterterrorism official, explaining that a trip that Mr. Rahami took to Turkey raised the possibility that he crossed the border to Syria and met there with operatives from the Islamic State, while his travel to Pakistan raises the possibility that he had contact with Al Qaeda. The official said that some investigators involved in the case believe that the variety of explosive devices Mr. Rahami is suspected of constructing suggested that he did have some   training beyond reading instruction manuals online. Mr. Rahami is accused of building 10 bombs. One exploded in Lower Manhattan, injuring 31 people another exploded in Seaside Park, N. J. but no one was injured. Five were discovered on Sunday night outside a train station in Elizabeth, N. J. “Most guys who go on the internet make one type of bomb,” the official said. “Here’s a guy who did two types of pressure cooker bombs and two different kinds of pipe bombs,” he added. “It suggests to us that he didn’t just look up ‘Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom,’” the official said, referring to an instruction manual published in the Al Qaeda online magazine Inspire, “but that he might have been somewhere and learned to make this stuff. ” A notebook recovered from Mr. Rahami after he was shot and taken into custody by the police in New Jersey suggests that he took much of his inspiration from the Islamic State and one of their founders, Abu Muhammad    —   who recently called on Muslims around the world to spill the blood of Westerners and nonbelievers wherever they found them. Mr. Adnani was killed in an American drone strike in August. While much of the writing in the journal is illegible because the book was punctured by a bullet and splattered with blood, what can be read indicates that Mr. Rahami may himself have been frustrated in his attempts to reach Syria and was using that as justification for committing terror at home. One page has the word “blocked,” followed by: “You should have let us meet death overseas. ” Investigators have not been able to interview Mr. Rahami since his arrest because he remains “incapacitated and intubated,” according to Paul J. Fishman, the United States attorney for New Jersey. “As such, he is not in sufficient physical health for presentment to the Court  —   even at a bedside proceeding,” Mr. Fishman wrote in a letter filed in federal court on Thursday. Investigators hope to learn more about Mr. Rahami’s life and travels from his wife, Asia, who one of the law enforcement officials said was now back in the United States after being detained in the Middle East while traveling from Afghanistan. Another senior law enforcement official said the F. B. I. did not believe she had knowledge of the plot. The officials said she had bought tickets for her trip well before the bombings. Mr. Rahami’s father said he had been worried for some time about the direction his son was heading, well before he spoke to federal agents and well before his son’s domestic dispute. He described his son’s internet activities as “a disease,” akin to an addiction. After the 2014 dispute, he said, he visited his son in jail. Ahmad Rahami asked his father for forgiveness, but he said he would not forgive his son until he was sure that Ahmad was not a terrorist and that the F. B. I. had cleared him. “The F. B. I. came back to me and said he’s clean,” Mohammad Rahami said. “They didn’t find anything on him. But they didn’t interview him. ” “I still had my doubts,” he said. “I was never 100 percent clear. ” At that point, he said, he decided not to pursue the charges stemming from the domestic dispute. Court records show that a grand jury declined to indict Ahmad Rahami on the charges. The father said he believed he did his duty by sharing his concerns with law enforcement. “What was required of me, I did,” he said. “And he’s not a kid  —   he’s 28 years old. ”"

Germany Seeks Tunisian Tied to Berlin Christmas Market Attack - The New York Times,"BERLIN  —   Investigators undertook a   manhunt on Wednesday for a young Tunisian   with multiple aliases who had been denied asylum in Germany and was considered a security risk, linking him to a deadly truck rampage through a Berlin Christmas market. The attack on Monday killed 12 people and wounded 48  —   12 of them seriously. The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the assault, one of Germany’s deadliest acts of terrorism in decades. The aftermath has been complicated by a botched search for the driver, who has remained at large. The revelations added to the growing pressure confronting Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who decided last year to open the country’s border to roughly a million migrants and refugees. A European arrest warrant identified the Tunisian as Anis Amri, 23, and said he had a history of providing false names and nationalities and should be considered armed and dangerous. German news agencies reported that the man had ties to Abu Walaa, a    Iraqi Salafist arrested in Germany last month and accused of recruiting   jihadists to fight for the Islamic State. A reward of 100, 000 euros, or about $104, 000, was offered for information leading to his arrest. It was not clear if the Tunisian was the actual driver. But the furious effort by the authorities to find someone who only months earlier faced deportation was outrageous, said Stephan Mayer, the home affairs spokesman for the conservative parliamentary bloc that includes Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union. The German interior minister, Thomas de Maizière, confirmed that a manhunt was underway but would not get into specifics. “Success counts, and not speed or speculation,” he told reporters in Berlin. Mr. Amri was recorded as having entered Italy in 2012, according to German news accounts. He traveled to Germany in July 2015 and applied for asylum in April this year, receiving papers that allowed him to stay in the country temporarily. He lived for a time in housing designated for asylum seekers in the city of Emmerich am Rhein, in North   Germany’s most populous state, and in Berlin. At a news conference in Düsseldorf, Ralf Jäger, the interior minister of North   said that federal prosecutors had been observing the Tunisian man  —   he did not use Mr. Amri’s name  —   on suspicion that he might have been plotting an attack. When the man moved to Berlin in February, state authorities there picked up the monitoring. The man was to have been deported in June, Mr. Jäger said. But because he did not have a valid passport, and because Tunisia did not initially acknowledge that he was a citizen, it was not possible to send him home. (Only on Wednesday did the Tunisian authorities issue a passport, he said.) Mr. Mayer, the lawmaker, said the Tunisian man had spent a day in custody pending deportation, but because the authorities were unable to establish his identity “beyond doubt,” he was released. “This is a person who apparently was known to be potentially dangerous and who apparently was to be deported,” Mr. Mayer said. In August, Mr. Amri was arrested in the southern city of Friedrichshafen with a fake Italian document and released a short while later, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a continuing investigation. An identity document found in a wallet left on the floor of the truck led the German authorities to seek the Tunisian man, said Frank Tempel of the Left Party. The document showed that the suspect had been allowed to remain in Germany but that he had not been granted full asylum. Several of the men involved in the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015, in Brussels in March and in Nice in July were of Tunisian origin, but the number of Tunisians in Germany is low. Mr. Amri is believed to come from the impoverished south of Tunisia, on the edge of the Sahara. His father told a Tunisian radio station, Mosaïque FM, that his son left Tunisia about seven years ago and served four years in prison in Italy after he was accused of setting fire to a school. The son was sentenced in absentia in Tunisia to five years in prison for violent robbery, the radio station reported. Tunisians make up one of the largest groups of foreign fighters in Syria and Libya and have held leadership roles in the Islamic State. Tunisian security officials say the militants have been active in recruiting young volunteers in Tunisia and have links to immigrant networks in Europe. A prominent Tunisian commander in the Islamic State, Boubaker   who was wanted in connection with terrorist attacks in Tunisia and was linked to the January 2015 attack on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris, was reported killed last month in a drone strike in Raqqa, Syria. According to the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, the Tunisian man being sought in Germany had lived in the city of Dortmund with a man named Boban S. who has been arrested and accused of involvement with the Islamic State. Boban S. in turn, is reported to have connections with Abu Walaa, the Iraqi who is known as “the man with no face,” because he often preached in Arabic and in poor German, with his back to the camera. The authorities arrested Abu Walaa on Nov. 8. Abu Walaa, who has also been identified by officials as Ahmed Abdulaziz A. made his base in Hildesheim, a city of 100, 000 south of Hanover, where he drew an increasingly devoted following and even offered his own app in 2014. He was charged with recruiting terrorists and openly supporting the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. Officials emphasized that they were not yet certain that the Tunisian man had carried out the attack, and officials cautioned against jumping to conclusions. On Tuesday, the authorities arrested a    Pakistani man who had applied for asylum in Germany, but they released him hours later, citing a lack of evidence. Ms. Merkel and other officials have emphasized that they did not want the attack to jeopardize Germany’s commitment to a free and open society, and Foreign Minister   Steinmeier reaffirmed that idea on Wednesday. “We want to uphold this way of life, and not let it be destroyed by anyone, not even whoever was responsible for what happened here,” he told reporters. Christmas markets in major German cities appeared to heed a call by Mr. de Maizière, the interior minister, to stay open. In Bonn, crowds continued to show up under the watch of the police. In cities like Dresden, the Berlin attack had its ominous presence felt with large obstacles to keep vehicles from getting among the stalls. The same was true in Vienna’s two famous markets, in neighboring Austria. Laws and traditions in Germany strongly emphasize personal privacy, and the identities of the victims of the attack have barely begun to emerge. One of the victims was a    woman from Neuss, a city in North   according to news reports. Fabrizia Di Lorenzo, an Italian transportation specialist who has been living in Germany for three years, has been missing since Monday, and her father, Gaetano Di Lorenzo, said he feared the worst. “We are here with my wife, waiting for the DNA results,” he said in an interview with the Italian daily Corriere della Sera. “We are waiting for confirmation, but I am not deluding myself. ” The daughter’s cellphone and transit pass were found near the scene immediately after the attack, her relatives and friends reported on Tuesday on social media. In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the attack “may have claimed the life of an Israeli citizen. ” He was referring to Dalia Elkayam, who has been missing since Monday and whose husband, Rami Elkayam, was seriously injured in the attack. Another victim of the attack was a Polish truck driver, Lukasz Urban, 37, who had a wife and young child and who was found dead in the cab of the truck. He had been stabbed and shot."
JPMORGAN: US recession risk is growing,"’Last Friday the US labor market continued to deliver the goods, despite a    rise in payrolls growth.’ ’Unemployment fell to just 4. 9% the first time it has started with a   since February 2008, while average hourly workings rose by 0. 5% leaving the annual acceleration at 2. 5% ahead of expectations.’ ’It was another bumper result.’ ’However, while the official labor market data continues to impress, it is a lagging economic indicator, reflective of past strength in the US economy  —   particularly the services sector  —   rather than where it is heading.’ ’According to JP Morgan’s economic research team, consisting of Bruce Kasman, David Hensley and Joseph Lupton, stalling labour market productivity, along the savage decline in the price of crude oil and recent strength in the US dollar is weighing on corporate profitability, increasing the risk that firms pull back on hiring and capital spending plans leading to a greater likelihood of sharp economic slowdown, or worse, in the quarters ahead.’ ’Labour market productivity simply measures the volume of goods and services produced within a nation by one hour of labour.’ ’Here’s a snippet from a research released by the trio over the weekend explaining their concerns.

Payrolls growth, shown in yellow, tends to lag changes in corporate profitability, shown in blue.’ ’As the trio note, a 10%    drop in corporate profitability is a rare event outside of a recession. On past occasions when this has eventuated, businesses spending and labour market hiring has tended to slow, resulting in a recession more times than not.’ ’To Kasman, Hensley and Lupton, while the slowdown does not immediately foreshadow a US recession, the risks of such an outcome occurring are building.’ ’“With the drag on US earnings intensifying and business spending softening, the risks of a broader business pullback remain elevated. Our US recession probability tracker has moved higher in recent weeks, reinforcing this point,” wrote the trio.’ ’The chart below is the banks’ US recession probability tracker. At present it calculates the odds of a US recession as a    chance over the next 12 months.’ ’With the US manufacturing PMI currently sitting in contractionary territory, and the separate   PMI gauge indicating that growth in the services sectors is now the slowest seen sine March 2014, the slowdown in labour market hiring in January may be a sign of what’s to come, rather than simply an anomaly.’"
Jack Daniel’s Embraces a Hidden Ingredient: Help From a Slave - The New York Times,"LYNCHBURG, Tenn.  —   Every year, about 275, 000 people tour the Jack Daniel’s distillery here, and as they stroll through its brick buildings nestled in a   hollow, they hear a story like this: Sometime in the 1850s, when Daniel was a boy, he went to work for a preacher, grocer and distiller named Dan Call. The preacher was a busy man, and when he saw promise in young Jack, he taught him how to run his whiskey still  —   and the rest is history. This year is the 150th anniversary of Jack Daniel’s, and the distillery, home to one of the world’s   whiskeys, is using the occasion to tell a different, more complicated tale. Daniel, the company now says, didn’t learn distilling from Dan Call, but from a man named Nearis Green  —   one of Call’s slaves. This version of the story was never a secret, but it is one that the distillery has only recently begun to embrace, tentatively, in some of its tours, and in a social media and marketing campaign this summer. “It’s taken something like the anniversary for us to start to talk about ourselves,” said Nelson Eddy, Jack Daniel’s   historian. Frontier history is a gauzy and unreliable pursuit, and Nearis Green’s story  —   built on oral history and the thinnest of archival trails  —   may never be definitively proved. Still, the decision to tell it resonates far beyond this small city. For years, the prevailing history of American whiskey has been framed as a   affair, centered on German and   settlers who distilled their surplus grains into whiskey and sent it to   markets, eventually creating a $2. 9 billion industry and a product equally beloved by Kentucky colonels and Brooklyn hipsters. Left out of that account were men like Nearis Green. Slavery and whiskey, far from being two separate strands of Southern history, were inextricably entwined. Enslaved men not only made up the bulk of the distilling labor force, but they often played crucial skilled roles in the   process. In the same way that white cookbook authors often appropriated recipes from their black cooks, white distillery owners took credit for the whiskey. In deciding to talk about Green, Jack Daniel’s may be hoping to get ahead of a collision between the growing popularity of American whiskey among younger drinkers and a heightened awareness of the hidden racial politics behind America’s culinary heritage. Some also see the move as a savvy marketing tactic. “When you look at the history of Jack Daniel’s, it’s gotten glossier over the years,” said Peter Krass, the author of “Blood and Whiskey: The Life and Times of Jack Daniel. ” “In the 1980s, they aimed at yuppies. I could see them taking it to the next level, to millennials, who dig social justice issues. ” Jack Daniel’s says it simply wants to set the record straight. The Green story has been known to historians and locals for decades, even as the distillery officially ignored it. According to a 1967 biography, “Jack Daniel’s Legacy,” by Ben A. Green (no relation to Nearis) Call told his slave to teach Daniel everything he knew. “Uncle Nearest is the best whiskey maker that I know of,” the book quotes Call as saying. Slavery ended with ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865, and Daniel opened his distillery a year later, employing two of Green’s sons. In a photo of Daniel and his workers taken in the late 19th century, a black man, possibly one of Green’s sons, sits at his immediate right  —   a sharp contrast to contemporaneous photos from other distilleries, where black employees were made to stand in the back rows. But corporate   was a rare practice in those days, and over time memories of Green and his sons faded. “I don’t think it was ever a conscious decision” to leave the Greens out of the company’s story, said Phil Epps, the global brand director for Jack Daniel’s at   which has owned the distillery for 60 years. Still, it is unlikely that anyone in the Jim Crow South thought a whiskey marketed to whites should emphasize its black roots. As the brand’s anniversary approached, the company started researching its various origin stories. It decided that the case for Nearis Green’s contribution was persuasive, and should be told. “As we dug into it, we realized it was something that we could be proud of,” Mr. Epps said. A business built on slave help may not seem like a selling point, which may explain why Jack Daniel’s is taking things slowly. The Green story is an optional part of the distillery tour, left to the tour guide’s discretion, and the company is still considering whether it will flesh out the story in new displays at its visitors center. However far the distillery decides to go, it is placing itself at the center of a larger issue that distillers and whiskey historians have begun to grapple with only in the last few years: the deep ties between slavery and whiskey. “It’s about paying down the debts of pleasure that have accrued over time,” said John T. Edge, the director of the Southern Foodways Alliance at the University of Mississippi. An exhibit on George Washington and slavery opening this fall at the first president’s Northern Virginia home, Mount Vernon, documents how he relied on six slaves (and two Scottish foremen) to run his rye whiskey distillery, one of the largest on the East Coast. “They were key to the operation in making whiskey,” said Steve Bashore, who helps run a working replica of Washington’s distillery. “In the ledgers, the slaves are actually listed as distillers. ” Slavery accompanied distilling as it moved inland in the late 18th century, to the newly settled regions that would become Tennessee and Kentucky. Though slave owning was nowhere near as common there as it was farther south, by the 1800s many successful farmers had at least a few slaves, who tended to be closely involved with whiskey production. Some of the earliest prominent Kentucky distillers, like Elijah Craig, Henry McKenna and Jacob Spears, relied on slaves to run their operations. (Craig and McKenna’s names are now on whiskeys made by Heaven Hill Brands, but those were created long after slavery was abolished.) Washington wasn’t the only president to use slaves in his distillery. In an 1805 advertisement, Andrew Jackson offered a bounty for a runaway slave named George, whom he identified as “a good distiller. ” Databases of ads for slave sales, as well as runaway slaves, are full of references to slaves as skilled whiskey distillers. In 1794, a Richmond, Va. man placed a $20 bounty on a slave named Will, who “has a large scar on his right side just below his ribs” and “understands making of whiskey. ” Slaves did more than just provide physical labor. If Green taught Daniel to distill, said Michael Twitty, a food historian, he probably would have drawn on generations of   skills: American slaves had their own traditions of alcohol production, going back to the corn beer and fruit spirits of West Africa, and many Africans made alcohol illicitly while in slavery. “There’s something to be said for the fact that Africans and Europeans were both people in the Southeast who carried with them ancient traditions for making alcohol,” Mr. Twitty said. Another aspect of the Jack Daniel’s tradition that is being reassessed is the   Lincoln County process, in which unaged whiskey is passed through several feet of maple charcoal, which removes impurities and imparts a slight sweetness. According to legend, the process was invented in 1825 by a white Tennessean named Alfred Eaton. But Mr. Eddy, the Jack Daniel’s historian, and others now say it’s just as likely that the practice evolved from slave distilling traditions, in which charcoal helped remove some of the sting from illicitly made alcohol. Other contributions are even harder to pin down. Though slave owners tended to value their slaves’ distilling prowess, they rarely documented how the slaves made such fine spirits. Evidence often has to be found outside the archives. Recent archaeological work in Kentucky has uncovered material pointing to slave distilling at a number of sites, including the famed Pepper distillery near Frankfort and another operation owned by Jack Jouett, a Revolutionary War hero. “It’s like looking at slave distillers out of the corner of your eye,” said Nicolas Laracuente, an archaeologist who has worked extensively at the site of Jouett’s house. “The reason we’re not finding them in the archives is that they didn’t have the right to be recognized. ” Mike Veach, a whiskey historian, said the influence of enslaved African distillers may explain a mystery in the development of American whiskey. Traces of German,   and English distilling traditions are evident in the American style, but there’s much that can’t be traced to an earlier source  —   a gap that slave traditions might fill. “I don’t know what role slaves would have played,” Mr. Veach said, “but I’m sure it was there. ” Fred Minnick, the author of “Bourbon Curious: A Simple Tasting Guide for the Savvy Drinker,” said it’s doubtful that a full accounting of enslaved people’s contribution to American whiskey will ever be written. “It’s extremely sad that these slave distillers will never get the credit they deserve,” he said. “We likely won’t ever even know their names. ” Despite the recent attention from Jack Daniel’s, Nearis Green’s name is just a faint echo, even among several of his descendants who live in the area. Claude Eady, 91, who worked for the distillery from 1946 to 1989, said he was related to Green “on my mother’s side,” but didn’t know much about him. “I heard his name around,” he said. “The only thing I knew was that he helped Jack Daniel make whiskey. ”"
How Philippe Dauman Lost the Battle for Viacom - The New York Times,"Just a few weeks ago, things seemed to be breaking Philippe A. Dauman’s way in his legal bid to maintain his grip on Viacom  —   which owns, among other things MTV, Comedy Central and Paramount Pictures  —   by having its majority owner and chairman, the    media mogul Sumner Redstone, declared mentally incompetent. In Massachusetts, a judge denied motions to dismiss Mr. Dauman’s suit, calling it “plausible” that Mr. Redstone was suffering under the undue influence of his daughter, Shari Redstone. The judge set an October trial date and ordered Mr. Redstone’s lawyers to turn over his medical records. In Delaware, in a parallel lawsuit brought by Frederic V. Salerno, Viacom’s lead independent director, a judge also ruled that the case could proceed and cleared the way for a medical examination of Mr. Redstone “in a dignified way,” while cautioning Viacom’s lawyers to refrain from acting like “attack” dogs. The Redstone forces dreaded the prospect of more examinations of the ailing and enfeebled billionaire, giving Mr. Dauman and his allies considerable leverage. So when word circulated late last week that a settlement had been reached, there was reason to expect that Mr. Dauman had largely prevailed. This week Viacom disclosed the terms of the settlement in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And for all practical purposes, Mr. Dauman “got nothing,” said John C. Coffee, a professor and expert in corporate governance at Columbia Law School. Mr. Dauman is already out as chief executive, and he will lose his board seat and position as chairman in a few weeks. He gets a severance package worth $72 million  —   but he would have gotten that anyway under his contract had he simply accepted his fate months ago and exited gracefully. Shari Redstone achieved almost total victory, but at the cost of months of expensive litigation and debilitating paralysis at Viacom. (This weekend’s box office dud, “” is the latest in a string of flops from Paramount.) She will soon be free to replace a majority of Viacom’s directors with people of her own choosing and has already named five new directors. For all intents and purposes, she has now gained unfettered control of her father’s vast media empire. And perhaps Mr. Redstone can retain what’s left of his dignity. So why did Mr. Dauman capitulate? Through a Viacom spokesman, Jeremy Zweig, Mr. Dauman declined to comment. His dwindling supporters contend that he simply acted in the best interests of Viacom’s shareholders after he realized that even a victory in the court cases would take years of litigation and appeals. But surely he knew that (and his lawyers would certainly have told him) before he launched his   assault. The real reason, my interviews this week with numerous participants suggest, is that Mr. Dauman had little choice after he lost the backing of many of his handpicked directors on Viacom’s board, who concluded that his confrontational tactics were harming the company and threatening to damage their own reputations. The settlement was largely negotiated not by Mr. Dauman and his lawyers, but by Mr. Salerno, the lead independent director, and representatives of Ms. Redstone, and dictated to Mr. Dauman. Before the settlement, Mr. Dauman played the role of attack dog decried by the Delaware judge  —   an approach he no doubt learned from decades at the side of Mr. Redstone who, in his prime, was notoriously combative and litigious. The two were so close that Mr. Dauman was once considered a surrogate son. “Dauman learned Sumner’s approach, which is he wanted total control at all times,” Mr. Coffee said. Mr. Redstone rewarded Mr. Dauman handsomely: Viacom paid him $491. 7 million over the last 10 years, according to Equilar, which compiles compensation data. But when Mr. Redstone finally stepped down as Viacom’s chairman in February, Ms. Redstone, newly reconciled and installed in the Redstone mansion as her father’s primary caregiver, opposed Mr. Dauman’s succession as Viacom’s executive chairman. In May, Mr. Redstone moved to replace Mr. Dauman and another longtime confidant of Mr. Redstone’s, George Abrams, as directors of the trust that governs National Amusements. National Amusements in turn controls Mr. Redstone’s 80 percent voting stake in Viacom. (Ms. Redstone controls the remaining 20 percent.) Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams sued to block their ouster from the trust, since that was obviously just the first step toward Mr. Dauman being replaced at Viacom. This seemed a dubious strategy from the   given that Mr. Redstone and his daughter controlled the company and Mr. Redstone, however physically impaired, had clearly turned against Mr. Dauman. To win in court, Mr. Dauman and his allies had to prove that Mr. Redstone “suffers from profound physical and mental illness,” as his complaint alleged  —   only months after he said in another court case that Mr. Redstone was “engaged and attentive. ” Despite Mr. Dauman’s early court victories, “there was no way he was going to ultimately win,” said Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. “It all comes down to the fact that the Redstones had the votes. You may not agree philosophically with the dual class of shares that gave them control, but that’s the reality. ” Perhaps Mr. Dauman was simply buying time, hoping that the mercurial Mr. Redstone might again abruptly shift his affections. In any event, Mr. Dauman had the support of the Viacom board, and, by casting their lots with Mr. Dauman over Ms. Redstone, they, too, were likely to lose their positions if the Redstones prevailed. Remarkably, Viacom agreed to pick up all of the costs of Mr. Dauman’s litigation assault against the Redstones, as well as Mr. Salerno’s Delaware lawsuit. Though they publicly maintained a united front, the board members began to waver in their support as the summer wore on, and Viacom under Mr. Dauman’s leadership posted disastrous operating results. The latest film in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, Paramount’s big summer movie, failed at the box office, prompting a profit warning. On Aug. 4, the company reported a 29 percent drop in profit for the latest quarter. Ratings agencies said they might downgrade the company’s debt to junk status. Given the uncertainty, companies didn’t want to make deals with Viacom, and key employees threatened to leave. Viacom shares have been battered, dropping 46 percent over the last two years. Then Mr. Salerno was distressed to learn that Mr. Dauman’s lawyers were pursuing settlement talks with the Redstone camp  —   without telling Mr. Salerno or other directors  —   that would provide him with some kind of transition role. While those talks were going on, Mr. Salerno was speaking regularly with Aryeh Bourkoff, founder and chief executive of LionTree, a boutique investment advisory firm. Mr. Bourkoff had no formal role (and wasn’t being paid) but, as investment bankers often do, offered his advice, which was to focus on the interests of the company and not Mr. Dauman’s increasingly bitter and personal feud with the Redstones. Once Mr. Salerno recognized that Mr. Dauman’s position as chief executive was no longer tenable, given Viacom’s deteriorating performance and continued hostility from the Redstones, he realized that his goals for the company weren’t all that different from Ms. Redstone’s. An early resolution of the lawsuits and the removal of Mr. Dauman would end the paralysis at the company, which is losing ground in a   media environment. Mr. Bourkoff contacted Ken Lerer, a venture capitalist, a founder of The Huffington Post (recently acquired by Verizon) and chairman of BuzzFeed. Mr. Lerer is close to Ms. Redstone, and she had publicly named him as one of her choices for the Viacom board. Mr. Bourkoff suggested Mr. Lerer meet privately with Mr. Salerno. With Ms. Redstone’s blessing, Mr. Salerno, Mr. Bourkoff and Mr. Lerer met at Mr. Lerer’s weekend home in Quogue, on Long Island, on Aug. 7, just three days after the weak earnings news. According to both Mr. Lerer and Mr. Bourkoff, it didn’t take long to reach the basic terms of an agreement. There wasn’t much in it for Mr. Dauman, although he avoided the prospect of years of mudslinging litigation that might well have damaged his reputation as much as Mr. Redstone’s. Mr. Salerno kept Mr. Dauman informed, but ultimately gave him little choice but to accept the terms. Mr. Salerno and the directors fared a little better. They get to stay on the board until the next annual meeting and board election, which will be moved up to no later than Feb. 3. National Amusements can then choose three of the six independent directors up for election, meaning three current board members will retain their seats. Thought it hasn’t been decided yet who those three will be, Mr. Salerno’s negotiating manages to keep some independent directors. Ms. Redstone’s five nominees (Mr. Lerer among them) will join the board now, and no material decisions can be made without a supermajority vote, effectively giving Ms. Redstone’s representatives immediate veto power over any major decision, such as a sale of Paramount. So what did Mr. Dauman accomplish, other than indulging his anger toward Mr. Redstone and enriching a bevy of lawyers and other advisers, to the detriment of Viacom? About the best that can be said for Mr. Dauman, Mr. Coffee offered, is that “it could have been worse. ” “He didn’t fight to the final bunker,” Mr. Coffee added. If he had, “Viacom would have been paralyzed for years. ”"
Top 10 Leading Heisman Trophy Candidates - Breitbart,"It is incredibly early, but it is always fun to speculate on the Heisman frontrunners. While this list is bound to ebb and flow, here’s our top ten as of now. [Notably absent from the list are Week 1 losers QB Josh Rosen (UCLA) QB Baker Mayfield (Oklahoma) and RB Leonard Fournette (LSU). Those players would have appeared on any preseason list and could be back on this one soon. However, early losses place them on the outside looking in at the moment. Other players to watch include QB Trevor Knight (Texas AM) who came up big for the Aggies, RB Mike Weber (Ohio State) who could carry the load for the Buckeyes as the season goes on, QB Seth Russell (Baylor) who is bound to put up bigger numbers, and a number of players at Alabama including Jalen Hurts, Blake Barnett, Damien Harris, and Bo Scarborough who will battle for touches as the season progresses.  10. RB Curtis Samuel (Ohio State) —  261 yards of total offense with 3 touchdowns in Week 1 make Samuel a surprise addition to this list. While an impact performer in his first two years, the Buckeye’s number of touches jumped dramatically and that will be worth watching to see if he will be truly featured in the offense. 9. RB Dalvin Cook (Florida State) —  Cook was a trendy Heisman pick going into the season, but he will battle Francois for attention. He gained 192 total yards against Ole Miss but garnered no touchdowns while his teammate stole the show. 8. QB Lamar Jackson (Louisville) —  How good will Louisville be? While it is doubtful that Jackson will consistently put up numbers like he did in Week 1 (over 400 total yards and 8 touchdowns) the sophomore will be well positioned if his team can be a contender. Florida State, Clemson, and Houston all make appearances on the schedule which is both an opportunity and a pitfall. 7. QB Kenny Hill (TCU) —  I am more conflicted about Hill than any other player on this list. The Horned Frog quarterback put up massive numbers and accumulated 5 touchdowns. Still his team struggled against South Dakota State, and he threw two costly picks. The signal caller formerly known as “Kenny Trill” is a big wildcard on this list. 6. QB Greg Ward (Houston) —  Ward put up yards through the air but was not overly accurate, and he really struggled on the ground against Oklahoma. However, he now has a signature win to his resume and is bound to put up even bigger numbers as the season progresses. 5. RB Christian McCaffrey (Stanford) —  College football’s most electric playmaker may be too low on this list, but he will be hurt by lack of major games as well as the timing of those contests. Matchups against USC, UCLA, and Notre Dame all lost a bit of their luster after Week 1. 4. QB Deondre Francois (Florida State) —  The young Seminole QB sent his stock skyrocketing with a monster comeback performance against Ole Miss. He will battle Dalvin Cook for attention throughout the season, but I firmly believe he will be a fixture on this list. 3. RB Nick Chubb (Georgia) —  If Chubb can stay healthy, he should remain on this list through the end of the year. His 222 yards in Game 1 was impressive. Watch how the elite runner does on September 24 at Ole Miss in what may be the biggest stage for the Dawgs this season. 2. QB JT Barrett (Ohio State) —  The Buckeye signal caller accounted for seven touchdowns in the first game, and he was in the conversation just two seasons ago. Ohio State will likely perform well enough to keep its players on the Heisman Watch List, but Samuel and Weber may pull attention from the star QB. 1. QB Deshaun Watson (Clemson) —  It was not Watson’s greatest statistical output, but he came into the season as the Heisman frontrunner and did nothing to change that perception. His team and ability to put up big individual numbers make him a near lock to earn an invitation to New York."
Canine competitor ’poisoned’ at Crufts dog show,"London (CNN) An investigation is underway after a canine competitor died the day after taking part in Crufts, one of the world’s most prestigious dog shows. An autopsy indicates  he was poisoned.    Irish setter Thendara Satisfaction    known to his owners as Jagger    took second prize in his class at the event in Birmingham, central England, on Thursday. But just a day later, after returning home to Belgium, he became ill.   Dee   told CNN Jagger was ”finding it hard to breathe” so a veterinarian was called, but the dog died before he could get there. ”The vet thought it was suspicious, so carried out an autopsy,” she said. ”They found cubes of beef in his stomach that had at least two types of poison inside. Pieces of beef had been stitched together so that the poison didn’t come out. ”He had enough in his system to kill a horse, according to the vet,” said   who is at a loss to explain why Jagger was targeted: ”We can’t fathom why anyone would do this.” ”I’ve been doing this for   years and I think I would have to give up on everything if I believed that someone who shows and breeds dogs would kill a dog. We all do this because we love dogs. If you hate me for being successful, then stick a brick through my window or something. But why would you involve a dog?” Toxicology tests are being carried out. The vet has reported the dog’s death to Belgian police, and   said she would likely contact West Midlands Police in the UK too. A spokesperson for the Kennel Club, organizers of the Crufts dog show, said there had never been such an incident in the history of the competition, which dates back to 1891. ”We are deeply shocked and saddened to hear this terrible news and our heartfelt sympathies go out to Jagger’s owners,” said Caroline Kisko, secretary of the Kennel Club, in a statement. ”We understand that a toxicology report is due next week and that this matter has been reported to the police   we will work with them and help however we can.” Television personality and writer Clare Balding, who hosts TV coverage of Crufts in the UK, took to Twitter to express her shock at the news: ”Everyone at #Crufts2015 horrified at death of Irish Setter Jagger    found poison. Awful for all concerned,” she tweeted."
Trump campaign urges Hill supporters to defend him in fight with Gold Star family,"Washington (CNN) As the blowback to Donald Trump’s public feud with a Gold Star family escalated on Monday, the GOP nominee’s campaign sent out talking points to congressional supporters urging them to come to his defense. The appeal didn’t generate much   for Trump. His continued    with   parents of a US soldier killed in Iraq left most Hill Republicans perplexed at how the GOP nominee wouldn’t let go of a spat with a grieving couple. Scott Mason, one of the Trump campaign’s Hill liaisons, emailed congressional supporters Monday afternoon with a lengthy response to the Khizr Kahn, whose speech at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia drew national attention. In it, Khan offered tough pushback to Trump’s proposed temporary ban on Muslim immigration and an emotional story about his son who died fighting in the Iraq War.   Mason’s message was for Hill offices to push out the campaign’s messages via press releases and social media to counter Khan’s continued critique of Trump, and encouraged offices to ”forward to me ASAP.” The request came after Republican senator and former P. O. W. John McCain of Arizona, sent out a scathing take down on Trump earlier in the day for ”disparaging” Khizr and Ghazala Kahn. ”Arizona is watching. It is time for Donald Trump to set the example for our country and the future of the Republican Party. While our party has bestowed upon him the nomination, it is not accompanied by unfettered license to defame those who are the best among us,” McCain said. Donald Trump’s bad 72 hours, Reuters first reported on the Trump campaign’s efforts to get Republicans in Congress to come to the billionaire nominee’s defense. In the document, obtained from a congressional source, the campaign argued that this is not fight between Trump and the Khan family but ‎”this is really about Mr. Trump vs. Hillary Clinton and who has the best vision for defeating radical Islamic terrorism‎.” It also said: ”Captain Khan and thousands of other brave American military members might still be alive today if Hillary Clinton had exercised better judgment and not created the hostile environment for our military in the Middle East. Iraq, Syria, Libya and Iran are areas of upheaval and unrest that are actively acting against American interests.” Khan was killed in 2004, while George W. Bush was president and before Clinton served as secretary of state. The campaign missive urged its supporters to call on the Democratic nominee to ”own up to these mistakes and apologize for the actions they have caused.” There was little evidence that Republican members were listening to the suggested language from the Trump campaign.   GOP aides told CNN they were mystified that Trump continued the feed the storyline, tweeting as late as Monday morning about Khan’s television interviews, digging in on the position that Khan had ”viciously” attacked him. Statements from vulnerable Republican senators and House members up for   denounced Trump’s tough language directed at the Khans, and honored them for their sacrifice for the nation’s security. Few members actually mentioned Trump by name.   But not a single Republican seeking to distance themselves from him revoked their support for the 2016 Republican nominee. GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn encouraged Trump to apologize to the Khan family, though, in an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. She also urged Clinton to make an apology to Pat Smith, a speaker at the GOP convention, whose son was killed in Benghazi.   Democratic lawmakers pounced on the issue.   Three House Democrats who served in the military    Reps. Ted Lieu,   Ruben Gallego,   and Seth Moulton,      sent a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan urging him to withdraw his endorsement of Trump."
"ISIS sets new prisoner handover deadline, post claims"," (CNN) Could a prisoner handover spare the lives of two ISIS hostages? A message purporting to be from the Islamist terror group sets a new deadline for a possible deal with the Jordanian government. The latest demand: Bring convicted terrorist Sajida   to the Turkish border by sunset Thursday, or Jordanian ISIS hostage Moaz   will be executed ”immediately.” But is ISIS offering anything in return?  From the latest message, it’s unclear. But previous video posts purportedly from ISIS have suggested the group was offering Japanese hostage Kenji Goto’s freedom in exchange for  ’s. CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the latest message, which was read by a person claiming to be Goto and posted online by ISIS supporters. In the message, Goto purportedly calls for  ’s release in ”exchange for my life.” It’s the latest twist in a complicated crisis with dizzying developments involving several countries. Here’s a look at the key people involved: • Goto, an experienced Japanese war journalist, has been at the center of several threats by ISIS since his capture. Last week, the group demanded $200 million from Japan in exchange for Goto and fellow Japanese hostage Haruna Yukawa, an aspiring security contractor. Since then, ISIS has claimed Yukawa is dead, but Goto is still alive. •   a Jordanian pilot, was captured by ISIS last month after the fighter jet he was flying crashed in Syria. ISIS says he’s still alive, but Jordan’s foreign minister told CNN his government has asked for a proof of life, but hasn’t received it. •   is an Iraqi prisoner on death row in Jordan for her role in 2005 bombings. ISIS has demanded her release by sunset Thursday (5:30 p. m. in Mosul, Iraq 9:30 a. m. ET). Jordan has said it’s willing to swap   for the Jordanian pilot. New deadline, but does swap offer stand? Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh told CNN on Wednesday that his country would release   if ISIS released  . Even though his government’s announcement of its offer doesn’t mention Goto, the foreign minister said that the Japanese journalist is not forgotten.  ”Of course,” Goto’s release would be part of a prisoner exchange, Judeh told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour. But the priority for Jordan is  ’s freedom, he said. It wasn’t clear whether ISIS would accept Jordan’s offer.  Families’ anguish, With the fates of their sons hanging in the balance, the families of Goto and   called on their governments to do everything they can to save the hostages before time runs out. Goto, 47, is reported to have three children, two of them with his current wife. His mother begged Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to secure her son’s release. ”Please save the life of Kenji,” Junko Ishido said. ”I call on you to work with all your strength in negotiations with the Jordanian government, until the very end.”  ’s father has called on Jordanian authorities to act as well. ”I firmly ask whomever has sent Moaz to fight outside the borders of Jordan, on a mission unrelated to us, to make strong efforts to bring back Moaz,” Safi   said Tuesday. ISIS says it captured   after he ejected from his   jet last month near Raqqa, the militant group’s de facto capital in Syria. ”Moaz’s blood is precious, it’s precious and it represents the blood of all Jordanians,” his father said.  But the pilot’s father suggested his son’s case shouldn’t be mixed up with Goto’s. ”To link Moaz’s situation with the Japanese journalist, this has nothing to do with us,” he said. ”The Japanese journalist has his country to defend him.” Grim track record, ISIS, which holds large areas of Iraq and Syria under its brutal rule, has a grim track record of ruthlessly killing hostages. Last year, it publicized its series of beheadings of three American and two British captives. The group has made a series of demands regarding the Jordanian and Japanese hostages. In a Saturday post purportedly from ISIS, a voice thought to be Goto’s first set out the idea of exchanging him for   but no clear deadline was mentioned. In that post, Goto held a photo of what appeared to be Yukawa’s decapitated corpse. A  post from the group on Tuesday announced that time was suddenly in short supply for Goto and the Jordanian pilot.  In that message, the Japanese hostage is shown handcuffed and dressed in orange, holding a picture that appears to be  . ”I’ve been told this is my last message,” a voice purporting to be that of Goto says, demanding the prisoner exchange. The video had said that ISIS would kill   and Goto within 24 hours if Jordan did not release  . CNN couldn’t independently verify the authenticity of the messages. The Japanese government said there was no evidence so far that it wasn’t Goto speaking in Tuesday’s video, which was posted to YouTube and distributed on social media by known ISIS supporters.  On Thursday, Japan’s prime minister told lawmakers his government was analyzing the latest possible message from ISIS. ”Given the nature of the issue, we cannot tell concrete details,” Abe said. ”However, within this extremely severe context, the government (of Japan) has been requesting cooperation from the government of Jordan and will continue making the utmost effort for swift release of Mr. Goto.”"

"In Nepal, lift spirits through music (Opinion)"," (CNN) Living on the fault line that has produced the world’s highest mountain ranges, the people of Nepal knew there would be a major earthquake someday.  Yet last Saturday’s heartbreaking losses still come as a devastating blow, from which Nepal will take years to recover. As the world pitches in to help with immediate relief, thoughts are also beginning to turn to   recovery. In the aftermath of the quake, Nepal’s musical traditions can help buoy the resilience and spirit necessary to rebuild the country.  When they could finally reach each other by phone, flutist Nirmal Singh related his experience of the earthquake to his uncle in Hawaii, who relayed his story to me. Nirmal was performing at a Hindu devotional gathering when the ground began to shake. After a moment of shock, he grabbed the bag holding all his bamboo flutes and fled the stage, seeking shelter in the open with other musicians and audience members alike. They watched helplessly as Kathmandu crumbled around them. In that moment, they felt their hearts crumble, too.  One day, he will perform music again, Several days later, Nirmal remains in a makeshift camp near the performance site, reeling from the earthquake’s devastation. He is trying to get up the courage to walk the five or so miles to his apartment, thinking of the devastation he will pass along the way, and fearful of what he might find when he gets home.   he doesn’t feel like playing music yet. But he takes comfort in listening. Nirmal comes from a family of flutists and flute makers. His uncle, fellow flutist and flute maker Ram Kumar Singh, told me he believes music and art will be necessary for the healing process. ”When we see and hear Nepali cultural sounds and images, it creates a mood for the victims to be more positive and to unite. Folk music and arts are the medium that creates a feeling of humanity. It totally ignores differences like ethnicity and political parties.”  For the last several years, Nepal’s government has been trying to restructure the state after a   civil war ( ). Amid   efforts to right decades of wrongs against marginalized peoples, ethnic identity politics have become a sticking point, and the major political parties have created a stalemate by refusing to compromise. While marginalized groups fight for   rights and representation, others use the threat of national disintegration to uphold their power and the status quo.  A way to further unity among people of Nepal, Regardless of their own ethnicity or political affiliation, musicians often embrace politics of a different sort. Their claims that music transcends differences are only partly true. Just as often, music and other performing arts celebrate difference, asserting proud identities associated with the country’s 126 registered ethnic groups, 123 spoken languages, and many regional and religious affiliations. Yet they do this in the spirit of social inclusion, appealing to notions of common humanity. The politics of music becomes a politics of humanistic unity, rather than antagonistic power plays.  This may sound a bit utopian. But in artists’ and ordinary folks’ musical responses to the quake, this prevailing discourse about music and unity may help avoid some of the problems that have occurred after other natural disasters. The power struggles over access to aid following the earthquake in Haiti and the tsunami in Sri Lanka threatened neighbors’ peaceful  .  Nepal will face similar challenges in the coming weeks, as relief efforts strive to distribute resources equitably under difficult conditions. The extent of damages in   rural areas still remains to be determined. So far, reports paint a picture of a country rallying together to survive. In another Kathmandu camp, writer Sanjeev Pokharel tweeted his delight at hearing his neighbors in the next tent singing. Music’s symbolic social harmony lives on. Laments provide shared catharsis, the continuation of local traditions sounding elements of hope.  In 2006, the Nepali folk band Kutumba played for programs about disaster relief. I was a guest performer, as was Barta Gandharva, a young singer and sarangi fiddle player. ”Let’s be safe from earthquakes!” Barta sang to a crowd in the ancient town of Sanothimi, a few miles east of Kathmandu. This town was all but destroyed in the last major earthquake of 1934, and on Saturday was once again reduced to rubble.  That day in 2006, we called elders up to the stage, and they told us their memories of the 1934 earthquake. ”Everything was broken,” said one old man. ”Our hearts still cry, remembering.” For a few moments he appeared lost in his sadness, years of hardships etched in the lines on his face. Then he, too, began to dance to the music.  Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook. . Read CNNOpinion’s new Flipboard magazine. "

"Mick Mulvaney: Government Shutdown ’Good’ If It ’Fixes Washington, DC, Permanently’ - Breitbart","WASHINGTON, D. C.  —   Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney told the White House Press Corps that while a government shutdown is “not desirable” it could become a reality come September if the appropriations process is not repaired. [Mulvaney also said a government shutdown could be “good” if it “fixes Washington, D. C. permanently. ”  President Trump tweeted out on Tuesday, “either elect more Republican Senators in 2010 or change the rules now to 51%. Our country needs a good “shutdown” in September to fix mess!” either elect more Republican Senators in 2018 or change the rules now to 51%. Our country needs a good ”shutdown” in September to fix mess!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 2, 2017,  Asked to respond to President Trump’s tweet about how a shutdown is “good,” Mulvaney said, “It’s not desirable   …     But you asked me what a good one would look like, and a good one would be something that fixes Washington, D. C. permanently. ” Mulvaney said the reason there is a discussion about a shutdown every few months “is because the appropriations process is broken. ” He said the “the way it’s supposed to work, and it used to work” is when the House passes an appropriations bill on a topic, the Senate then passes a bill on the same issue, before it goes to the conference committee, before that bill is placed on the president’s desk. ” Mulvaney said that, since he has worked in the government, this process has “never worked” the way it’s supposed to. He added: I don’t think it has functioned for the last decade. I’ve been here since 2011 and it has never worked. We want to get back to that process. But the reason we can’t get back to that process is because the Senate is requiring 60 votes on every single appropriations bill and that is forcing this discussion on continuing resolutions  —   which is a bad way to run the government  —   and forcing a discussion on shutdowns which is simply not productive. Later in the press conference, Mulvaney said, “The president wants to see Washington better, get better, get fixed, change the way it does business. ” He said the Democrats are saying, “They won and we lost is not a bipartisan way to approach things. ” Drawn back to the topic of Trump’s early morning tweet by a member of the White House Press Corps once again, Mulvaney said, “I think what he’s foreshadowing is, ‘look, this place has to change.’ The way we run the town has to be fixed. We have to do something. We cannot simply muddle along using models the previous administration has used. ” Mulvaney said Trump is a president that will usher in change. “And he’s going to change Washington, D. C. And if it takes a shutdown, then that’s what it takes. But again, that’s several months away from that discussion. We have a lot to do between now and then. ” Follow Adelle Nazarian on Facebook and Twitter."
"Prerequisite for Key White House Posts: Loyalty, Not Experience - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   President Trump’s point man on   negotiations is a longtime Trump Organization lawyer with no government or diplomatic experience. His liaison to   leaders is a former   villain with a penchant for résumé inflation. And his Oval Office gatekeeper is a   former New York City cop best known for smacking a protester on the head. Every president sweeps into office with a coterie of friends and   who sometimes have minimal experience in the arcana of the federal government. But few have arrived with a contingent more colorful and controversial than that of Mr. Trump, whose White House is peppered with assistants and advisers whose principal qualification is their long friendship with Mr. Trump and his family. There is Jason Greenblatt, the former Trump Organization lawyer, whose portfolio now includes peace in the West Bank, international trade deals and relations with Cuba. Omarosa Manigault, whose star turn on “The Apprentice” propelled the show’s breakout first season, is now among about two dozen aides with the rank of assistant to the president  —   and one of the few with   privileges for the Oval Office. Most other staff members must go through Keith Schiller, who rose from   security guard at the Trump Organization to its director of security. Mr. Schiller is now the director of Oval Office operations, controlling physical access to a president whose whims and frustrations routinely send aides throughout the building scurrying to deflect, defend and justify. The influence of longtime Trump friends and associates  —   some of them with vague portfolios  —   comes as a leadership void has been created by the Trump administration’s slow pace in filling top jobs in many agencies. It has also added to the confusion of a West Wing already legendary for its power struggles, while bewildering Washington policy hands. “Titles do matter,” said Paul C. Light, a presidential scholar at New York University. “You don’t say: ‘You are my buddy you are my friend you were with me on my television show. I’m going to give you a really great title.’ These are not things to be handed out like candy. ” To help him wrangle Silicon Valley chief executives and modernize United States government technology systems, Mr. Trump has hired Reed Cordish, the scion of a Baltimore real estate dynasty who is married to a close college friend of Ivanka Trump, who set them up. In a statement, Mr. Cordish said his real estate experience had taught him how to successfully meld public and private interests. The president also recently hired Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and a Trump family friend, to work in the White House Office of Public Liaison and Intergovernmental Affairs. Mr. Giuliani, 31, who made headlines after he sued Duke University for kicking him off the college golf team, previously worked in sales and marketing at a small suburban New York financial firm. Personal relationships with the president often bestow a power exceeding official West Wing job titles. Valerie Jarrett, a businesswoman, former city official in Chicago and longtime friend of the Obamas, was renowned for her unmatched access to President Barack Obama and reach into policy matters far beyond her official portfolio. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House press spokeswoman, said Mr. Trump had recruited highly skilled advisers with refreshingly different backgrounds. “Even though some of the staff doesn’t have government experience it doesn’t mean they are amateurs,” she wrote in an email. “President Trump has promised to change Washington and you can’t do that by putting Washington bureaucrats in charge of everything. ” If Mr. Trump appears more eager than past presidents to bring in longtime associates with limited Washington experience, friends said, it stems partly from his background of four decades at the helm of a closely held family business, with no experience in public service. He has had to assemble a White House team largely from scratch, tapping a party apparatus he believed had tried to deny him the nomination and a Republican policy elite that had largely opposed him. The bulk of his senior White House aides were unknown to him until two years ago. ”Trump doesn’t have a longtime staff of political aides these loyalists fill that vacuum,” said Christopher Ruddy, a friend and chief executive of Newsmax Media, the conservative news site. “He is figuring out who he can depend on. ” Mr. Schiller, 58, a    former narcotics detective, has protected Mr. Trump for 18 years. The head of a Praetorian Guard of private security detectives, Mr. Schiller occupied a Trump Tower office on the same floor as his boss and learned, he said, to anticipate his wishes. A fierce protector of Mr. Trump’s image and interests, he physically removed a reporter from a 2015 news conference on the campaign trail after he repeatedly questioned Mr. Trump without being called on. Five activists later sued Mr. Schiller, the Trump Organization and other Trump security guards, claiming they had been assaulted during a protest outside Trump Tower in September 2015. Mr. Schiller has acknowledged hitting one man but said the man attacked him first. No longer responsible for Mr. Trump’s physical safety, he is now a combination gatekeeper, valet and security blanket  —   a familiar face for a president who detests solitude and whose wife and youngest son have remained at Trump Tower. But Mr. Schiller has not entirely shed his role as Mr. Trump’s enforcer. During a briefing on health care legislation on Friday, he shouted at reporters to clear out of the Roosevelt Room after they tried to question Mr. Trump about continuing controversies. Mr. Greenblatt’s ties to Mr. Trump have translated into more striking levels of power and prestige. A lawyer who helped Mr. Trump negotiate business deals for two decades, Mr. Greenblatt rose to become the Trump Organization’s chief legal officer and executive vice president. Now, as special representative for international negotiations for the White House, Mr. Greenblatt, 49, is charged with negotiating trade agreements and overseeing the   conflict and United   relations. Mr. Trump has called him “brilliant. ” But experts say it is hard to imagine how anyone, no matter how intelligent, could handle three such sensitive and complex assignments without previous experience. “Our sense is that the Trump White House views the foreign policy establishment as pretty feckless. They seem to think that applying a business approach can work better,” said Martin S. Indyk, the executive vice president of the Brookings Institution, who was President Obama’s special envoy to the Middle East. “Not to have experience or knowledge of the issues in dispute, nor any relationship with the Palestinians, will be a challenge,” he said. In announcing his appointment, Mr. Trump said Mr. Greenblatt’s success in negotiating complex transactions and building consensus made him the ideal roving global negotiator. Mr. Greenblatt has told reporters that after so many years at Mr. Trump’s side, “I know how he thinks I know how to get his bidding done. ” In a brief telephone interview, Mr. Greenblatt suggested calling back later when “I’ll have something to actually say that’s meaningful. ” Through the press office, he addressed the trade aspect of his portfolio, saying that working with Mr. Trump taught him how government can impede job creation. Still, C. Fred Bergsten, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a member of the president’s Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations, said he had never known a White House official “outside of the trade policy network who has been assigned negotiation of trade issues. ” By law, the Office of the United States Trade Representative is charged with negotiating trade deals. Various   secretaries also weigh in on policy. “So what would that leave for this guy?” Mr. Bergsten asked. “It’s very mysterious. ” A sign of Mr. Greenblatt’s expansive role came last month, not long after he traveled to Capitol Hill with Peter Navarro  —   a   economist who is head of Mr. Trump’s newly created National Trade Council  —   to discuss trade policy with staff aides of the Senate Finance Committee. Mr. Greenblatt missed a   session with senators because Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was visiting the White House that day. “He’s got to negotiate Middle East peace,” Mr. Navarro quipped to the senators, according to a person who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “So he can’t be here today. ” Although Mr. Greenblatt has not been given the title of special envoy to the Middle East, he appears to be acting in that role too. Visiting the region this week, he met Mr. Netanyahu in Israel on Monday and is scheduled to meet the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. A State Department spokesman said Monday that a senior National Security Council official was accompanying Mr. Greenblatt, but was unsure whether a State Department official had been included. Mr. Greenblatt appears more independent of the State Department than at least some previous envoys he has told others he reports not to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, but to the president’s    Jared Kushner, 36, one of the most senior White House advisers. And where past envoys were foreign policy specialists, Mr. Greenblatt told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency in April that his main sources of information were daily email alerts, material supplied by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and a weekly Jewish radio program. “There’s just a tremendous amount of literature out there, emails and all that, so I read all of those as often as I can,” he said then. Still, Mr. Greenblatt seemed at that point somewhat taken aback that Mr. Trump had identified him to the news agency as his principal adviser on Israel, telling reporters that Mr. Greenblatt was so passionate that “when he goes on vacation, he goes to Israel. ” “I knew that he was relying on me for certain aspects of Israel, but I didn’t know I was his top adviser,” he said. Ms. Manigault, 43, has no policy experience, a spotty history in her previous federal positions and a résumé that has cast her  —   inaccurately  —   as a university professor and a former top aide to Vice President Al Gore. Yet, to the consternation of the president’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and others, Mr. Trump has given her the same title of presidential assistant as Mr. Priebus and other senior aides  —   and regularly includes her in   strategy sessions on the budget and other matters. She said in a January interview in Variety that Mr. Trump “really wanted me to have the freedom to work on many different things. ” In a statement from the White House press office, Ms. Manigault said that “while some people try to tear me down,” she was focused on giving women, minorities and other groups a voice in the White House. Nominally, Ms. Manigault directs the office of communications in the White House’s public liaison office, a midlevel post. She is also a bridge to   groups, including the heads of more than 60 historically black colleges and universities who met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office last month. She also joined a State Department delegation to the inauguration of Haiti’s president, Jovenel Moïse. She said Mr. Moïse had invited her because of her previous hurricane relief work in the country. “She is the     in the White House, and she has the ear of the president,” said Paris Dennard, a White House director of   outreach under President George W. Bush. “That is a good thing. ” During the presidential campaign, Ms. Manigault cast herself as an insider, saying Mr. Trump has called her “his Valerie Jarrett. ” In an interview published last June in Essence magazine, she said, “I’m the person who pulls him back when he goes too far. ” In her White House post, she has already had a few   reminiscent of her     role on “The Apprentice,” including a much publicized confrontation with a veteran White House reporter. (Mr. Trump also sponsored a   dating show called “The Ultimate Merger” in which she starred.) Ms. Manigault has told others that she earned her way to a White House position. She grew up on welfare in a housing project in Youngstown, Ohio, and lost her father to violence at age 7, but went on to earn a college degree and, at age 24, a job in the office of Vice President Al Gore. But while her ascent is impressive, it is not quite as she has described it. On a 2005 résumé provided by a former employer, she described herself as Mr. Gore’s “senior scheduling and advance coordinator” overseeing all aspects of his schedule. She continues to maintain that description is accurate and that she succeeded at the job. But numerous former staff members in that office said that she was pushed out of an   $   job replying to invitations to Mr. Gore after 13 months, leaving a pile of unanswered correspondence under her desk. “She was the worst hire we ever made,” said Mary Margaret Overbey, Mr. Gore’s former office administrator. Ms. Manigault transferred to a job as deputy associate director of presidential personnel, then eight months later moved to the Commerce Department. In her statement, she said she performed well in that job. But Cheryl Shavers, then the agency’s under secretary for technology administration, disagreed, saying Ms. Manigault “was unqualified and disruptive,” so “I had her removed. ” On her official website and elsewhere,  Ms. Manigault also has identified herself as a professor at Howard University in Washington. But Anthony D. Owens, a university spokesman, said she actually was a “facilitator and presenter. ” A letter from the university that Ms. Manigault provided states that she was an instructor, a temporary position. Ms. Manigault also maintains that the only requirement left for her to complete a doctorate at Howard is to defend her dissertation. But Carolyn M. Byerly, chairwoman of the university’s communications department, said that according to the university’s rules, the   period for her to do that expired more than a decade ago. Ms. Manigault tweeted her support for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2014, but when Mr. Trump decided to run for president she joined his campaign and defended him vigorously. At an   victory party in November, she gave a television interview during which she warned that Mr. Trump’s campaign was keeping an “enemies” list. Her “Apprentice”  pugnacity notwithstanding, Mr. Trump insists there is a side of her that she keeps well hidden. “Omarosa’s actually a very nice person,” he joked at a Roosevelt Room breakfast that she helped organize last month to celebrate Black History Month. “Nobody knows that. ”"

Rand Paul: Most Companies Wouldn’t Hire Bill Clinton—’Threat’ to Young Women,"Sen. Rand Paul ( ) told Breitbart News exclusively on Tuesday that most American companies would not take the risk of hiring former President Bill Clinton in the wake of sexual assault and rape allegations from a litany of women including Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick, Gennifer Flowers, Kathleen Willey, and more. [“I think most company policies in most American corporations wouldn’t even hire someone like Bill Clinton because of his threat to the young people in the workplace,” Paul told Breitbart News in the exclusive phone interview. “As CEO in any company in America, his behavior with an intern would be so unacceptable that he’s really not someone that any company in America would hire. ”  Paul also said that the Clintons —  as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Bill’s husband, seeks to ascend to the presidency —  must answer these questions and must answer them in a straightforward manner. Paul argued that the woman should be believed when it comes to allegations of rape and sexual assault, and that no exception should be made for Bill Clinton. “I think it is important,” Paul said. “Probably one of the most poignant questions that was addressed to Hillary Clinton was, ‘Hillary Clinton: When a woman says that she has been raped, or a woman says that she has been taken advantage of, should we believe her?’ The question that was asked of her was ‘Should we believe women when they report that someone has harassed her?’ That’s what Hillary Clinton said, is you should, and a person in the audience said ‘well, what about Bill?’ And she refused to answer the question, and I think that’s unacceptable. There’s been a lot of accusations. Should we believe the accuser, or should we take Bill Clinton’s word for it?”  A spokesman for the Clinton campaign has not responded to a request for comment at this time. The Clintons have largely aimed to avoid answering when pressed on this matter, but at this time presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump is pushing the issue extraordinarily hard. In an interview on Sean Hannity’s program on Wednesday night, Trump is expected to use the term “rape” with regards to Bill Clinton for the first time. Trump has promised he will push the Clintons on these questions throughout the course of the election. Meanwhile, Paul, one of Trump’s former competitors in the 2016 GOP primary, backed his candidacy in the first part of this Breitbart News exclusive interview on Tuesday. Paul said that now that Trump is the GOP’s presidential candidate, he intends to support the pledge he made to back the nominee. Paul just won   as the GOP nominee for U. S. Senate in Kentucky and is expected to easily defeat his   Democratic opponent in November’s general election in the   coal mining state. More from Paul’s exclusive interview with Breitbart News —  including much more about the Clintons —  is forthcoming."
"Oh, What a Voice: A Revival for a Member of the Four Seasons - The New York Times","Don Ciccone may never have achieved the fame of Frankie Valli, but he was a vital member of the Four Seasons, and sang on some of their biggest hits. That is his catchy voice on tastier sections of “Who Loves You” and “December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night),” both revived in the smash Broadway musical “Jersey Boys. ” Mr. Ciccone also led The Critters in the 1960s, with hits like “Younger Girl” and “Mr. Dieingly Sad,” and was a musical director and bassist for Tommy James and the Shondells in the ’90s. An obscure footnote to his extensive recording career was an unreleased batch of songs he recorded in the early 1970s with his longtime friend Brian Gari, 64, a   who lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Mr. Gari wrote the songs and backed Mr. Ciccone on piano on recordings they made as demos to interest record labels. Of 20 selections, several were produced and released as complete songs, but even on the remaining sparse tracks, Mr. Ciccone’s vocals shone. “Don had that    kind voice and we always liked the tapes,” said Mr. Gari, who hung on to those old    demo tapes for the next 45 years. He and Mr. Ciccone would occasionally prod each other to dust them off and release them as a “Ciccone Sings Gari” album. In early October, Mr. Ciccone contacted Mr. Gari and said he planned to finally do just that, but a week later Mr. Ciccone died of a heart attack at age 70. “The week before he died, Don told me he wanted to put out the demos,” Mr. Gari recalled. “He said, ‘My next project is ‘Ciccone sings Gari. ’” Mr. Gari said he decided to realize Mr. Ciccone’s “last wish,” and, on a recent weekday, he was in a music studio near Union Square working with a sound engineer, Peter Millrose, to give Mr. Ciccone’s remarkable vocals on the old tapes a proper setting. One number called, “I Just Had to Say My Last Goodbye” had the jaunty, melodic feel of Todd Rundgren, or the band Chicago in the 1970s. Working from Mr. Gari’s stylistic cues, Mr. Millrose layered piano, bass and drums, and then toyed with horns, strings and other effects to punctuate Mr. Ciccone’s phrasings. As Mr. Gari suggested various riffs or motifs, Mr. Millrose played them on a keyboard and added them to the digital recording until the spare track had become a slick, sturdy, fully orchestrated song. Mr. Millrose worked from sheet music of lyrics and chords written by a teenage Mr. Gari with help from his mother, who unlike Mr. Gari, had the musical training to write the melodies on music paper. Some original elements would not be preserved, like the simulated rainstorm augmenting a lover’s farewell in “She Left on Good Terms. ” The two recorded the song in Mr. Gari’s apartment and used the bathroom shower for rainfall sound effects, along with Mr. Ciccone making sounds of thunder. Mr. Gari called the project bittersweet, bringing him both the joy of hearing Mr. Ciccone’s youthful voice again, but also a twinge of sadness that he was not around to participate and enjoy the results. “It had been my dream to do this album, but I never thought it would happen after he died,” said Mr. Gari, who kept the tapes among a large trove of materials he has amassed in the sprawling,   apartment on West End Avenue where he has lived for more than 50 years while writing almost 1, 000 songs, several books and the music and lyrics for “Late Nite Comic,” which had a brief Broadway run in 1987. Mr. Gari has been married twice and held both his weddings in the apartment, which is full of memorabilia, including a vast archive of Upper West Side photos and film clips he has shot since he was in elementary school. One room is packed with items from Mr. Gari’s maternal grandfather, Eddie Cantor, the movie and radio star. Shortly before his death, Mr. Cantor wrote a letter to the    Brian, praising his creativity and anointing him as “the one to carry on the tradition of show business in the family. ” Mr. Gari immediately began writing songs and riding the bus around Manhattan, selling his songs to music publishers. He enjoyed watching Mr. Ciccone perform with The Critters on “ ” an afternoon dance show hosted by John Zacherle, known as “The Cool Ghoul. ” Mr. Gari wrote an adoring fan letter to Mr. Ciccone in 1966. Mr. Ciccone wrote back and their ensuing correspondence led to a friendship. By 1971, Mr. Gari was a struggling songwriter and Mr. Ciccone was looking for his next recording contract. Mr. Gari would play him the catchy teenage love songs he had written with melodies that he described as in the “sunshine pop” vein. Of the 20 songs they recorded, several were made into fully produced songs, including “Bicycle Ride,” and “Silent Celebration,” which were issued by the Metromedia label on a 45 r. p. m. record. They recorded through 1973, when Mr. Ciccone joined the Four Seasons for a tenure that lasted through 1981. One of his Four Seasons bandmates from the era, Lee Shapiro, will produce one of the songs, Mr. Gari said. Mr. Gari said he hoped to release a CD of the 20 songs, several of which will include guitar work by his friend Dean Bailin, who played the memorable guitar fills on the 1979 hit “Escape (The Piña Colada Song). ” Mr. Gari said he would be happy if the “Ciccone Sings Gari” CD sold just enough copies to cover his recording costs. “I’m doing it because it’s the right thing to do. I’m doing this in his honor,” he said. “It fulfills my dream and his last wishes. I’m taking his death and making something positive out of it. ”"
Study Claiming Video Games ’Train’ Players for Real-World Violence Retracted - Breitbart,"A 2012 report on the effect of violent video games on players has been retracted by the publisher. [Communication Research has officially retracted a report entitled “‘Boom, headshot! ?’: Effect of Video Game Play and Controller Type on Firing Aim and Accuracy” by Jodi L. Whitaker and Brad J. Bushman. The report claimed that “  shooter” video games could have a lasting effect on players for instance, that playing these games might be able to “‘train’ a person to shoot a gun,” and “influence players to aim for the head. ”  The retraction is due to variable irregularities within the study, which suggest that the numbers therein may have been skewed toward the desired conclusion. Villanova University Psychology Professor Dr. Patrick Markey and Behavioral Psychology Dr. Malte Elson of Ruhr University recommended the article’s retraction after Communication Research Editor Professor Jennifer Gibbs received what she called “a detailed report that documented data irregularities in the study” which showed that “the main findings would not have held up without these irregularities. ” Whitaker was put on notice for misconduct by Ohio State University. Bushman has claimed Drs. Markey and Elson were engaged in a deliberate smear campaign against him: “I believe Dr. Markey has an ulterior motive for going after me and my former Ph. D. student Jodi Whitaker  —   he wants to discredit my research and ruin my reputation. ” But Bushman was forced to agree with the retraction when unable to verify the original sources of the study’s data. He’s claimed that the original author, Cengiz Altay, could not be contacted due to the attempted coup in Turkey. Elson, however, denied the accusation in a statement made to Retraction Watch: I am pleased to see the paper is finally retracted almost 3 years after the authors were first notified of the concerns (and 2 years after it was first reported to the Ohio State University). The public record has now been corrected, which is the only thing Patrick and I ever wanted after we found evidence of severe errors in the data on which the now retracted paper was based. For his part, Markey feels so strongly that studies attempting to link violent video games to negative behavior are incorrect that he is publishing a book in rebuttal. Moral Combat: Why The War On Violent Video Games Is Wrong will hit bookshelves in March 2017. Editor’s note: This story has been updated to clarify that Whitaker was investigated for misconduct according to Retraction Watch but not Bushman.

Joe Biden: ‘I Wish to Hell I’d Just Kept Saying the Exact Same Thing’ - The New York Times,"Joe Biden’s personal compartment on the modified Boeing 757 that serves as Air Force Two had the feel of a motel manager’s office equipped with     communications gear. The room held a little black couch with a pullout bed he had slept on more times than he could count over the last eight years, during which he logged more than a million miles aloft. We were en route back to Wilmington, Del. from Cartagena, Colombia, in early December, and Biden was sitting in a black leather seat with a binder in his lap. It contained the speech he had given at the Democratic National Convention in July. He told me he had been rereading it. He began reciting aloud: “If you live in neighborhoods like the one Jill and I grew up in, if you worry about your job and getting decent pay. . .. ” His voice accelerated. “If you worry about your children’s education, if you’re taking care of an elderly parent, there’s only one person in this race who. . .. ” He looked up at me and sighed. “I wish to hell I’d just kept saying the exact same thing. ” Biden was afflicted with regret. He was sorry that, on the campaign trail, he had spoken so often about Donald Trump’s unfitness for office and not enough about what Hillary Clinton would do for the middle class. He was sorry he didn’t push harder inside the White House for a   tax cut. And he was still torn over his decision not to run for president, a race that he said would have been “brutal” but that he also believed he could have won. I spoke with Biden intermittently in the months before and after Election Day, and I had no doubt as to why he didn’t jump in. He was still corny, gabby, lovable Uncle Joe, the guy who once said: “Stand up, Chuck! Let ’em see you!” to a man in a wheelchair. But nearly every speech and interview now included some moving mention of his son Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015, and how much Biden was doing, and intended to continue to do for the rest of his life, to speed the search for cancer cures. I saw Biden cry in Manchester, N. H. in October when holding an infant that he was told was named after Beau. I saw him near tears in West Mifflin, Pa. the weekend before the election, when he was joined onstage by the former Pittsburgh Steelers Franco Harris and Mel Blount  —   which reminded him of the footballs the team owner sent to young Beau and his brother, Hunter, in the hospital after they were injured in the 1972 car accident that killed Biden’s first wife and baby girl. On his deathbed, Beau advised his father to run, but many friends  —   including President Obama  —   didn’t think he was up to it emotionally, and the vice president finally agreed. “For all that’s important to me in almost a sacred sense,” he told me mournfully, the decision was unavoidable. “The family was broken, and I was more broken than I thought I was. ” How broken? “I don’t know what I’d do if I was in a debate and someone said, ‘You’re doing this because of your son,’’u2009” he told me one late November day in his West Wing office. “I might have walked over and kicked his ass. ” And yet minutes later, he was standing at his desk, fidgeting and replaying what might have been in 2016. The South Carolina primary would have given him a strong start, he said, citing his internal polls there. “Hard to believe, but I was more popular with blacks than Barack was. ” Biden clearly loathes the new president he said during the campaign that if he and Trump were in high school, he’d “take him behind the gym” for the way he bragged about groping women. Trump reminded him of the bullies who teased him as a child on account of his stutter, calling him “  . ” But the politician who has long believed all politics is personal wants to keep it impersonal with Trump. “The president and I have concluded that there’s no value in making that ad hominem argument,” he told me of Obama. “It gets you nowhere. ” Biden wasn’t shocked that Hillary Clinton lost. He had noticed before the election that Trump was connecting with the people he grew up with in Pennsylvania. This shaped his thoughts on how Democrats should respond. When the subject of Trump came up aboard Air Force Two, Biden referred to a   story about how, as a freshman senator, he saw Jesse Helms, the archconservative North Carolina Republican, ripping into a piece of disabilities legislation. Biden was furious about it and began attacking Helms to Mike Mansfield, the Democratic Senate majority leader. Puffing on his pipe, Mansfield asked Biden if he knew that Helms and his wife had adopted a disabled    boy no one else would take. “Question a man’s judgment, not his motives,” Mansfield instructed. Biden, who was invited by Helms decades later to give his eulogy, is convinced that absorbing Mansfield’s advice is what allowed him to work with Senate Republicans during the Obama years, to negotiate the approval of the New Start    treaty, the end of “don’t ask, don’t tell” and the expansion of the   tax credit, among other accomplishments. His approach to Trump, he said, wouldn’t be fundamentally different. “It falls in that category,” Biden told me. “It’s one thing to say: ‘I think the proposal on the following is a serious mistake. I think it’s gonna do the following damage.’ It’s another thing to say, ‘The guy’s a fucking idiot, and he is an egomaniac who’s a whatever. ’’u2009” Biden suggested he might lobby former Republican colleagues when “circumstances generate blowback among mainstream Republicans. ” He remains in the shrinking camp that believes Trump may yet step up, at least a bit, to the demands of high office. His hope is that Trump’s “sense of grandeur is so immense that he’d rather succeed than unleash these forces. ” Given how many Trump voters would lose their insurance under full repeal of the Affordable Care Act, he may well back off of repealing it, Biden said. As for the rest of his own administration’s legacy, he said, “I’m not prepared to bet my granddaughter’s college tuition, but it’s less likely to be undone than frayed on the edges. ” Biden’s biggest worry is that Trump, for all his bluster, could be a global bystander, unwilling to engage a messy world with anything more than  . “The question I get everywhere is: ‘Is American leadership going to continue? ’’u2009” he told me on Air Force Two. If Trump “just stays behind the lines  —   hands off  —   it could be very ugly. Very, very ugly. ” In July, the president of Latvia asked Biden to fly there as soon as possible and give a televised speech assuring the Baltic states that the United States would fulfill its NATO obligations and defend them against a Russian invasion. He did so, emphatically, but his promises offer little comfort   Day. The prospect of Vladimir Putin fulfilling his dream of   Russian hegemony over Eastern Europe is not far from Biden’s mind. “Now if we walk away  —   Hungary, Poland, even the Baltic states, these guys all start to hedge their bets,” he said. Biden’s national security adviser, Colin Kahl, who was with the vice president on the plane, interjected to outline the contradictions in Trump’s emerging foreign policy. If the United States is going to be more cooperative with Russia and Bashar  ’s Syria but more confrontational with Iran, Kahl asked, how will Trump handle them joining together to fight ISIS? “It’s like a Rubik’s cube trying to figure this guy out,” Biden sighed. “We have no freakin’ idea what he’s gonna do. ” When they were Senate colleagues, and Biden was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Biden thought Obama was in too much of a hurry  —   and Obama found the chairman a tad condescending. But in the White House, the two men became exceptionally close. “There was never a point,” Obama told me recently, “where I thought he was distancing himself from me or positioning himself. Never been a time when he wasn’t telling me something he really thought. ” Their families, too, drew together. “Family has been central for us  —   that’s our baseline,” Obama told me. “We both feel freer to do what we think is right because if it doesn’t work out, our families will still love us. ” Biden later told friends that he thought the president was sincerely looking out for him in 2015 when he advised him not to run  —   though he also felt Obama had grown fond of the bright mark he could leave on history by passing the baton from the first black president to the first female president. The big question now is when, and how, they will   the arena. Obama has already said that, unlike George W. Bush, he won’t refrain from commenting on his successor. Biden may go further. Amid discussion of resistance to Trump, he surprised me with talk of 2020, when he’ll turn 78. “I’ll run,” the vice president deadpanned, “if I can walk. ” Three days later, he informed the Washington press corps that he wasn’t joking. Biden isn’t likely to run, but keeping the door ajar gives him a bigger voice in Democratic Party debates. The one that worries him most is over repositioning to win back Trump voters. He has little patience with Democrats who want to move either left or right. “’u2009‘We gotta move to the center,’ ‘We gotta move to those white guys,’ ‘We gotta move to those   people’ or ‘We gotta double down on the social agenda. ’’u2009” It’s a false choice, he said: “They are totally compatible. I have never said anything to the A. C. L. U. that I wouldn’t say to the Chamber of Commerce. ” This was the vision of the Democratic Party to which Biden had dedicated his career. “Amtrak Joe” famously commuted every day from Wilmington to Washington  —   three hours   for 36 years. He told me that as the train neared Baltimore, he habitually peered into the rapidly passing homes close to the tracks  —   a flip book of   families of various backgrounds who might have recognized themselves in his convention speech. “I wonder what the conversation at the dinner table is,” he told me. Sometimes he saw his own family in the early 1960s in those houses. He imagines the families’ struggles with everyday expenses: “’u2009‘Honey, we need a new set of tires, but you gotta get another 20, 000 miles out of them.’ That’s the goddamn discussion people are having! That’s their lives!” Before the election, Biden had begun to map out what his    plans would look like. Soon he would be back on Amtrak, riding to and from a   institute bearing his name at the University of Pennsylvania and a   center at the University of Delaware, and continuing the “cancer moonshot”  —   a   initiative marshaling resources in government and the private sector to accelerate cancer research. In the meantime, he’ll help play defense against Trump. “Even if the Democratic Party didn’t want me, I’m not walking away,” he said. “I’ve worked on this stuff my whole life. ” After Air Force Two touched down on the tarmac in Wilmington, I asked him about a line he liked to use before the election. “So do you still believe what your grandfather said, that God looks out for drunken Irishmen and the United States of America?” Biden said he wasn’t sure about the Irishmen, but he was about the country. “I have to believe that,” he said. “There’s no sense being in this business unless you’re an optimist. ”"
"Disney Worker, American Father Forced to Retrain Foreign Hires: ’It Was Torture’ - Breitbart","On Breitbart News Sunday, American Disney IT worker Leo Perrero spoke out against one of the world’s largest mass media corporations, which forced him and other   Americans out of their jobs and blackmailed them into training cheap, imported foreign workers without exposing the abuse of the   visa program on pain of losing their severance packages. [Perrero described how the corporation, represented by beloved childhood icon Mickey Mouse, kicked an American father to the curb:  We were given 90 days notice by a prominent Disney executive that we were going to train our foreign replacements. If we didn’t do so, we wouldn’t receive our severance package. Over that   period, they recorded everything we did with the audio and video on our computers, and right at the end, we were ushered out the door. And the foreign workers that were flowing in just weeks before took over our jobs, and we were long gone. It was the most humiliating thing I’ve ever gone through. It really challenged my patriotism, because I felt like I was selling out my country like a prostitute, taking money in exchange for selling out my country. It was just utterly humiliating. It was torture. Every single day I was going through it  —   it was the hardest thing I’ve ever gone through in my life. Breitbart News executive chairman and host Stephen K. Bannon asked what made GOP frontrunner Donald Trump and recent endorser Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions different from the normal political campaigns. “Well, they just really impressed me,” Perrero said: I testified before a Senate subcommittee last week  …     Senator Sessions has been after this problem for a very long time. He’s really one of the few trying to push bills through that will make a change to this broken   visa program that’s being abused. I’m really proud that he’s trying to do something there. It’s just kind of disheartening that there’s just such a small group that’s really going after this actively. And him endorsing Trump today really, I think, says a lot. Sessions is a really great man, and I’m proud he’s doing what he’s doing. And when he endorses somebody, that really makes it solid to me as well. Perrero added some Democrats are fighting on behalf of displaced Americans like himself as well, but Washington as a whole is united in favor of mass immigration. “They’re just really not gaining much traction yet with the current lawmakers in office,” he said. Perrero also testified before the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest earlier in the week about the media corporation: During the holiday season of 2014, I was sent a meeting invitation by a prominent Disney executive. With an excellent review in hand along with company announcements of record profits my mind buzzed with thoughts of a promotion or a bonus. I walked into a small conference room with about two dozen highly respected fellow IT workers. The Disney executive made a harsh announcement to us all. ‘Your jobs have been given over to a foreign workforce  …     In the meantime you will be training your replacements until your jobs are 100 percent transferred over to them and if you don’t cooperate you will not receive any severance pay.’ Later that same day, I remember very clearly going to the local church pumpkin sale and having to tell the kids that we could not buy any because my job was going over to a foreign worker. During his testimony, Perrero revealed that corporations use the   visa program to humiliate, silence, and expel American workers all across the nation: “The situation at Disney is not an anomaly. This same abuse is happening nationwide. ” LISTEN: "

And I never     had that feeling when I was growing up. Never. I mean, were     there really rich people, of course there were. My father loved     to complain about big business and big government, but we had a     solid middle class upbringing. We had good public schools. We     had accessible health care. We had our little, you know,       house that, you know, he saved up his money, didn’t     believe in mortgages. So I lived that.

That, I     think, has probably been true for all of our history, and if     you saw the Spielberg movie, Lincoln, and how he was     maneuvering and working to get the 13th Amendment passed, and     he called one of my favorite predecessors, Secretary Seward,     who had been the governor and senator from New York, ran     against Lincoln for president, and he told Seward, I need your     help to get this done. And Seward called some of his lobbyist     friends who knew how to make a deal, and they just kept going     at it. I mean, politics is like sausage being made. It is     unsavory, and it always has been that way, but we usually end     up where we need to be. But if everybody’s watching, you know,     all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then     people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need     both a public and a private position. And finally, I think  —   I     believe in   decision making. I want to know what     the facts are. I mean, it’s like when you guys go into some     kind of a deal, you know, are you going to do that development     or not, are you going to do that renovation or not, you know,     you look at the numbers. You try to figure out what’s going to     work and what’s not going to work.

And I think that there’s a lot     that could have been avoided in terms of both misunderstanding     and really politicizing what happened with greater     transparency, with greater openness on all sides, you know,     what happened, how did it happen, how do we prevent it from     happening? You guys help us figure it out and let’s make sure     that we do it right this time.

To function effectively those markets and     the men and women who shape them have to command trust and     confidence, because we all rely on the market’s transparency     and integrity. So even if it may not be 100 percent true, if     the perception is that somehow the game is rigged, that should     be a problem for all of us, and we have to be willing to make     that absolutely clear. And if there are issues, if there’s     wrongdoing, people have to be held accountable and we have to     try to deter future bad behavior, because the public trust is     at the core of both a free market economy and a democracy. ”     [Clinton Remarks to Deutsche Bank,   ]   ’ ’     *CLINTON SUGGESTS WALL STREET INSIDERS ARE WHAT IS NEEDED TO     FIX WALL STREET*   ’ ’     *Clinton Said Financial Reform “Really Has To Come From The     Industry Itself. ” *   ’ ’     “Remember what Teddy Roosevelt did. Yes, he took on what he saw     as the excesses in the economy, but he also stood against the     excesses in politics. He didn’t want to unleash a lot of     nationalist, populistic reaction. He wanted to try to figure     out how to get back into that balance that has served America     so well over our entire nationhood. Today, there’s more that     can and should be done that really has to come from the     industry itself, and how we can strengthen our economy, create     more jobs at a time where that’s increasingly challenging, to     get back to Teddy Roosevelt’s square deal.

There’s nothing magic about regulations, too     much is bad, too little is bad. How do you get to the golden     key, how do we figure out what works? And the people that know     the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the     industry. And I think there has to be a recognition that, you     know, there’s so much at stake now, I mean, the business has     changed so much and decisions are made so quickly, in nano     seconds basically. We spend trillions of dollars to travel     around the world, but it’s in everybody’s interest that we have     a better framework, and not just for the United States but for     the entire world, in which to operate and trade. ” [Goldman     Sachs AIMS Alternative Investments Symposium,   ]   ’ ’     *CLINTON ADMITS NEEDING WALL STREET FUNDING*   ’ ’     *Clinton Said That Because Candidates Needed Money From Wall     Street To Run For Office, People In New York Needed To Ask     Tough Questions About The Economy Before Handing Over Campaign     Contributions. *   ’ ’     “Secondly, running for office in our country takes a lot of     money, and candidates have to go out and raise it. New York is     probably the leading site for contributions for fundraising for     candidates on both sides of the aisle, and it’s also our     economic center.

So I     think that it’s something  —   I would like  —   you know, obviously     as somebody who has been through it, I would like it not to     last as long because I think it’s very distracting from what we     should be doing every day in our public business. I would like     it not to be so expensive. I have no idea how you do that. I     mean, in my campaign  —   I lose track, but I think I raised $250     million or some such enormous amount, and in the last campaign     President Obama raised 1. 1 billion, and that was before the     Super PACs and all of this other money just rushing in, and     it’s so ridiculous that we have this kind of free for all with     all of this financial interest at stake, but, you know, the     Supreme Court said that’s basically what we’re in for. So we’re     kind of in the wild west, and, you know, it would be very     difficult to run for president without raising a huge amount of     money and without having other people supporting you because     your opponent will have their supporters.

But    —   and     I know you heard from Erskine earlier today  —   put forth the     right framework. Namely, we have to restrain spending, we have     to have adequate revenues, and we have to incentivize growth.     It’s a   formula. The specifics can be negotiated     depending upon whether we’re acting in good faith or not. And     what Senator Simpson and Erskine did was to bring Republicans     and Democrats alike to the table, and you had the full range of     ideological views from I think Tom Coburn to Dick Durbin. And     they reached an agreement. But what is very hard to do is to     then take that agreement if you don’t believe that you’re going     to be able to move the other side. And where we are now is in     this gridlocked dysfunction. So you’ve got Democrats saying     that, you know, you have to have more revenues; that’s the sine     qua non of any kind of agreement. You have Republicans saying     no, no, no on revenues; you have to cut much more deeply into     spending. Well, looks what’s happened. We are slowly returning     to growth. It’s not as much or as fast as many of us would like     to see, but, you know, we’re certainly better off than our     European friends, and we’re beginning to, I believe, kind of     come out of the long aftermath of the ‘08 crisis.

And that was true across the U. S.     government. And we knew it was going on when I would go to     China, or I would go to Russia, we would leave all of our     electronic equipment on the plane, with the batteries out,     because this is a new frontier. And they’re trying to find out     not just about what we do in our government. They’re trying to     find out about what a lot of companies do and they were going     after the personal emails of people who worked in the State     Department. So it’s not like the only government in the world     that is doing anything is the United States. But, the United     States compared to a number of our competitors is the only     government in the world with any kind of safeguards, any kind     of checks and balances. They may in many respects need to be     strengthened and people need to be reassured, and they need to     have their protections embodied in law. But, I think turning     over a lot of that material intentionally or unintentionally,     because of the way it can be drained, gave all kinds of     information not only to big countries, but to networks and     terrorist groups, and the like. So I have a hard time thinking     that somebody who is a champion of privacy and liberty has     taken refuge in Russia under Putin’s authority. And then he     calls into a Putin talk show and says, President Putin, do you     spy on people? And President Putin says, well, from one     intelligence professional to another, of course not.

S. Have     Universal Health Care Like In Canada.*   ’ ’     “You know, on healthcare we are the prisoner of our past. The     way we got to develop any kind of medical insurance program was     during World War II when companies facing shortages of workers     began to offer healthcare benefits as an inducement for     employment. So from the early 1940s healthcare was seen as a     privilege connected to employment. And after the war when     soldiers came back and went back into the market there was a     lot of competition, because the economy was so heated up. So     that model continued. And then of course our large labor unions     bargained for healthcare with the employers that their members     worked for. So from the early 1940s until the early 1960s we     did not have any Medicare, or our program for the poor called     Medicaid until President Johnson was able to get both passed in     1965. So the employer model continued as the primary means by     which working people got health insurance. People over 65 were     eligible for Medicare. Medicaid, which was a partnership, a     funding partnership between the federal government and state     governments, provided some, but by no means all poor people     with access to healthcare. So what we’ve been struggling with     certainly Harry Truman, then Johnson was successful on Medicare     and Medicaid, but didn’t touch the employer based system, then     actually Richard Nixon made a proposal that didn’t go anywhere,     but was quite far reaching. Then with my husband’s     administration we worked very hard to come up with a system,     but we were very much constricted by the political realities     that if you had your insurance from your employer you were     reluctant to try anything else. And so we were trying to build     a universal system around the   system. And indeed     now with President Obama’s legislative success in getting the     Affordable Care Act passed that is what we’ve done. We still     have primarily an   system, but we now have people     able to get subsidized insurance. So we have health insurance     companies playing a major role in the provision of healthcare,     both to the employed whose employers provide health insurance,     and to those who are working but on their own are not able to     afford it and their employers either don’t provide it, or don’t     provide it at an affordable price. We are still struggling.     We’ve made a lot of progress. Ten million Americans now have     insurance who didn’t have it before the Affordable Care Act,     and that is a great step forward. (Applause.) And what we’re     going to have to continue to do is monitor what the costs are     and watch closely to see whether employers drop more people     from insurance so that they go into what we call the health     exchange system. So we’re really just at the beginning. But we     do have Medicare for people over 65. And you couldn’t, I don’t     think, take it away if you tried, because people are very     satisfied with it, but we also have a lot of political and     financial resistance to expanding that system to more people.     So we’re in a learning period as we move forward with the     implementation of the Affordable Care Act. And I’m hoping that     whatever the shortfalls or the glitches have been, which in a     big piece of legislation you’re going to have, those will be     remedied and we can really take a hard look at what’s     succeeding, fix what isn’t, and keep moving forward to get to     affordable universal healthcare coverage like you have here in     Canada.

Verizon Announces New Name Brand for AOL and Yahoo: Oath - The New York Times,"Oath? Oof. That was largely the reaction on Monday to the news, reported by Business Insider, that Verizon plans to house two giants of the early days of the internet, AOL and Yahoo, under the new name Oath. Tim Armstrong, the head of Verizon’s AOL division, confirmed the announcement in a Twitter post on Monday afternoon: “Billion+ Consumers, 20+ Brands, Unstoppable Team. #TakeTheOath. Summer 2017. ” The brand will apply to the digital media division of Verizon after it buys Yahoo’s internet assets for $4. 48 billion, a deal that is expected to close by the end of June. But do not count the legacy brands out just yet: Yahoo, AOL and The Huffington Post will continue to exist and operate with their own names  —   under the Oath umbrella. Verizon has said that much of Yahoo’s value lies in its deep relationship with its customers, and services like Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Sports engender deep loyalty among users. Similarly, AOL. com and AOL Mail still have followings. But Oath will be a way for Verizon to present its family of digital content services to advertisers and other partners as a single entity. The company could also develop some new services under the Oath brand. Many greeted the announcement with bewilderment, with some suggesting that Oath sounded like the name of a heavy metal band. Others compared it to Tronc, last year’s largely panned rebrand of Tribune Publishing, the company behind The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and several other major daily newspapers. TechCrunch, the Silicon Valley news site, summed up the general confusion in the headline of a post about the announcement: “Yahoo + AOL = Oath, for some reason,” it read."
’Downton’ star: Refugees deserve chance of future," (CNN) Ahmed has a thoughtful elegance to him and his black roll neck makes me think he should be playing trumpet in a basement jazz bar somewhere. He hates his teeth though, which are in poor condition after almost four years of living on the road, in railway stations and refugee camps.  Like many of the 57, 000 refugees in Greece, Ahmed is waiting to have a future.  We are in Northern Greece in Alexanderia at one of the many refugee sites run by the Greek government and supported by the UNHCR. After the borders with Macedonia closed in March and the EU instated its    deal with Turkey only two months later, the options for Syrian refugees have become extremely limited.   Ahmed has already lost his two eldest sons to the civil war    both were killed in an explosion near Aleppo, where they once lived. Now he lives with his remaining family in a frustrating stasis, neither able to continue forward any time soon to the rest of Europe nor go back to his homeland.  A child’s eye view of the refugee crisis, ’Everything beautiful is dying’ Like Ahmed, Wafaa too is waiting. Waiting to   with her young husband who crossed into Germany just before the borders closed.  She is tired and a little hesitant but once she begins to open up she is staggeringly eloquent. A fashion designer and henna artist back in Syria, she has covered the interior of the space with impressive pieces of art made from discarded boxes and paper.   For a moment it feels like we could be at an exhibition rather than in a small tent alongside eight hundred others in a refugee site near Lagadikia, a small town in northern Greece.  Her children play with an impressive dolls house she has made them from corrugated cardboard. Like Ahmed she desperately wants them to have a future, a reality that seems more and more distant with each passing month.  ”We feel like everything beautiful inside us is dying,” she says, ”just like our country.”  Like Ahmed and Wafaa, my grandfather travelled a similar refugee route back in 1941    though his took him in the opposite direction.   As the Nazis swept into Athens he escaped Greece in a small boat, making the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean to Turkey in  .  From there he made his way by land to the safety of Damascus.  Nothing to return to: Iraq’s displaced, Refugees face a fight to survive, Even I had to remind myself how incredibly recent this was and how quickly we tend to forget our own history.   Not that long ago millions of Europeans were seeking refuge and safety from the devastation of war.  This is what meeting Ahmed, Wafaa and countless others reminded me of    these are people exactly like you and me, just trying to live, trying to survive.   We are in the middle of one of the worst humanitarian crises since World War Two and still Britain, Europe, and the wider world are slow to respond.  Families like Ahmed’s and Wafaa’s cling desperately to the hope that maybe, just maybe their children have a future. I think they deserve one.

American Sniper: Palin’s attack on ’Hollywood Leftists’ personal,"Washington (CNN) Sarah Palin is not so subtly slamming filmmaker Michael Moore for his tweet dissing snipers. ”Hollywood leftists: while caressing shiny plastic trophies you exchange among one another while spitting on the graves of freedom fighters who allow you to do what you do, just realize the rest of America knows you’re not fit to shine Chris Kyle’s combat boots,” Palin wrote on her Facebook Page on Monday.  She didn’t mention Moore by name, but she was clearly reacting to Moore’s controversial tweet, saying ”We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren’t heroes. And invaders r worse.” Michael Moore explains snipers are ’cowards’ tweet, Moore later insisted he was not taking aim at the real life ”American Sniper,” Chris Kyle, or Bradley Cooper who played Kyle in the blockbuster movie. That’s unlikely to convince Palin. It turns out her passion is personal. Chris Kyle was on Palin’s security team in 2011 when she visited Pella, Iowa, and the two remained friends.   Kyle also got to know Todd Palin well when the two competed against one another on the NBC show ”Stars and Stripes” in 2012 to raise money for charity.  After Kyle was killed in 2013, the Palins attended his funeral and Todd Palin said he would donate his winnings from an Iron Dog race that year to Kyle’s memorial fund. Opinion: Why I refuse to see ’American Sniper’ Moore isn’t the only public figure on the receiving end of Sarah Palin’s mama grizzly protectiveness of Kyle and his widow, Taya. She went after former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura in 2013 for continuing a lawsuit against Kyle even after his death. Ventura was suing Kyle for defamation for claiming during his book tour that he knocked Ventura out. ”Hey tough guy, Jesse Ventura, your feelings were hurt because you perceived your reputation was besmirched by words in a book?” Palin said. ”So you turn around and sue, expecting $2 million from a military widow and her fatherless children? Yeah, like that is going to help your reputation, jackass.” In her Facebook post Monday, Palin was eager to shower praise on Cooper and director Clint Eastwood ”for respecting the United States Military.” ”May the epic ’American Sniper’ bring nothing but blessings to Taya and the children of this true American hero,” Palin wrote.

Johnny Manziel Indicted for Misdemeanor Assault on Girlfriend - Breitbart,"The saga of Johnny Manziel turns another chapter on Monday when a Dallas County grand jury hands down an indictment against the former Cleveland Browns quarterback for an alleged assault on his   Colleen Crowley, in January. [The 2012 Heisman trophy winner faces a charge of misdemeanor assault, which carries a maximum punishment of one year in jail and a $4, 000 fine.  On Thursday a grand jury charged Manziel, but in Dallas County indictments are official after two working days, the Dallas Morning News reported.  Crowley maintains that on the night of Jan. 29 at the Hotel ZaZa in Uptown Dallas, Manziel beat her so bad that he burst her eardrum. After the incident Crowley secured a protective order preventing Manziel from seeing her for two years and mandating that the former Aggies icon stay at least 500 feet away from her home and place of work, reports WFAA News 8. Manziel’s string of bad news continues. Last week Drew Rosenhaus became the second sports agent this year to terminate a contract with the    Texan.  In February, agent Erik Burkhardt parted ways with Manziel shortly after the domestic assault allegation. Clearly, Burkhardt had had enough with Manziel after his repeated episodes of bad behavior, which included missed team meetings and alleged alcohol abuse. Earlier in April, Manziel’s landlord alleged that he and friends trashed the premises of her $4 million house to the tune of $32, 000 in damages. Moreover, Fox News reported that at the recent Coachella Rock festival, the NFL outcast “arrived wasted, partied wasted and stayed wasted. ” The Browns released Manziel after just two seasons last month. The indictment, atop numerous   issues, make Manziel surfacing with another NFL team anytime soon unlikely. "

CBS News Awed by ’Relatively Reliable’ Smart Gun - Breitbart,"On January 12 CBS News was awed by a smart gun that is unlocked by a   fingerprint reader and is “relatively reliable. ”[The gun is a . 40 caliber Glock that MIT freshman Kai Kloepfer altered by making it inoperable unless activated by the swipe of an authorized user’s finger across the reader. On October 8 Breitbart News reported on this very gun as it was being developed by Kloepfer and he admitted that the smart gun’s reader will not work if the authorized user is wearing gloves or if his fingers are dirty. Smartphone users have the same problem. And Kloepfer’s fingerprint reader also failed to work if the authorized user’s fingers were wet —  just like a smartphone.  But CBS News is euphoric because the gun is “relatively reliable. ” And even though Kloepfer admitted the gun would not stop mass shootings, he believes his smart gun could save some lives. After all, Kloepfer says “it functions almost every single time. ” Lost on Kloepfer and CBS are all the additional lives that could be lost when the gun does not function —  those represent lives that could have been saved had the victim reached for a traditional handgun that goes bang every time. Moreover, think of all the additional sexual assaults that could occur in a scenario where a firearm is only “relatively reliable. ” Each fail could represent a horrific assault that could have ended if the victim had grabbed a classic,    revolver. It is interesting to note Kloepfer’s admission that his gun would not stop mass shootings, because this may actually be the strongest argument against smart guns that needs to be made. In the “theory” surrounding such guns, the authorized user of the weapon would be the person who passes a background check to acquire it. That would mean, the Orlando Pulse gunman —  who passed a background check for both his weapons —  would simply shoot up the place and slaughter innocents with his smart gun instead of a traditional firearm. It also would mean the San Bernardino attackers (December 2, 2016) the UCLA   gunman (June 1, 2016) the Umpqua Community College gunman (October 1, 2015) Allison Parker’s murderer (August 26, 2015) the Lafayette movie theater attacker (July 23, 2015) the Chattanooga attacker (July 16, 2015) the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal attacker (Jun 17, 2015) the Muhammad Cartoon Contest attackers (May 3, 2014) the Las Vegas cop killers (June 9, 2015) the Santa Barbara attacker (May 23, 2014) the Fort Hood attacker (April 2, 2014) the Arapahoe High School attacker (December 13, 2013) the D. C. Navy Yard attacker (September 16, 2013) the Aurora movie theater attacker (July 20, 2012) Gabby Giffords’ attacker (January 8, 2011) the Fort Hood attacker (November 5, 2009) and the Virginia Tech attacker (April 16, 2007) would have still been able to carry out their heinous acts because they all passed background checks for their weapons. The only difference would have been that they would have carried them out with a smart gun instead of a traditional firearm. Is CBS News listening? The point is clear —  even if smart guns worked they would not prevent evil people from carrying out evil deeds. The only thing that stops such people is an equal or greater amount of force coming at them when they try to carry out such foolishness. And that equal or greater amount of force is brought to bear by a good guy with a gun that goes bang every time, not a good guy with a gun that is “relatively reliable. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

"6 stabbed at Jerusalem gay pride parade, police say"," (CNN) An Orthodox Jew who stabbed marchers at a Jerusalem gay pride parade 10 years ago launched another knife attack at the same type of parade in the same city Thursday, stabbing and wounding six people who were on the streets for the event, police said. Of the six people stabbed Thursday, two were injured seriously, Israeli police spokeswoman Luba Samri said. Police arrested Yishai Shlissel, Samri said. Israeli police say Shlissel, an Orthodox Jew, was released from prison three weeks ago after serving a   prison sentence for stabbing and wounding three marchers at a Jerusalem gay pride parade in 2005. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the government would ”pursue justice for those responsible” for the latest attack. The government fell short of calling it an act of terror, but Netanyahu did call it ”a despicable hate crime.” ”In the state of Israel, the freedom of choice of an individual is one of the most basic values,” the Prime Minister said. ”We must ensure that in Israel every man and woman lives confidently in any way they (choose).  ”This is how we operate and this is how we will continue to operate. I wish a speedy recovery to the injured.” ’Gay’ couple physically, verbally abused during social experiment in Moscow, Video aired on Israel’s Channel 10 shows what appears to be part of the attack 10 years ago: a man making quick slashing motions at people on a Jerusalem street, including one holding a rainbow flag, while others try to subdue him. Channel 10 also aired video in the moments immediately after Thursday’s attack showing several wounded people, including a woman    her shirt bloody    who was put onto a stretcher and into an ambulance. Another woman was shown bleeding from her arm as someone applied pressure to the wound.  ”We came together today for a festive event, but the joy was shattered when a terrible hate crime occurred here in Jerusalem, the capital of Israel,” President Reuven Rivlin said of the incident. ”People celebrating their freedom and expressing their identity were viciously stabbed. We must not be deluded, a lack of tolerance will lead us to disaster. We cannot allow such crimes, and we must condemn those who commit and support them.” 2014: Man’s beating at Detroit gay pride festival caught on tape"
Glenn Beck ’Steamed Out of the Room’ When Donald Trump Crashed His Caucus Speech,"Glenn Beck was left “steamed” after Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump crashed his caucus speech at a Nevada high school Tuesday evening, where the talk radio host had been speaking in support of Sen. Ted Cruz. [A small audience at Palo Verde High School in Summerlin listened as Beck stumped for Cruz ahead of the final voting. Under Nevada caucus rules, a designated surrogate is allowed to speak on behalf of a presidential candidate for up to two minutes while   consider their votes.  In his speech, Beck, who last week invited supporters to fast for a Cruz victory in the Nevada caucus, said he’d spent five years watching Cruz “carefully. ” “America was great not because of a president, but America was great because of two reasons,” Beck said. “The Constitution of the United States, and that its people were good. We have almost lost our country and our Constitution. ” But as Beck spoke, Trump arrived at Palo Verde High School, drawing the crowd and the network TV cameras quickly away from Beck’s speech.  MSNBC happened to have live cameras rolling when Trump entered the room: Roll Call’s Emily Cahn posted several tweets in the aftermath of the interruption: . @glennbeck is speaking on behalf of @tedcruz in Summerlin. #Nevadacaucus pic. twitter.   —   Emily Cahn (@CahnEmily) February 24, 2016,  . @realDonaldTrump shows up as @glennbeck speaks. Room goes wild! #Nevadacaucus pic. twitter.   —   Emily Cahn (@CahnEmily) February 24, 2016,  Chants of “Trump! Trump! Trump!” rang out as the Republican frontrunner entered the high school and spoke to supporters, who virtually mobbed the candidate in the hopes of speaking with him. In an interview on Fox News Wednesday morning, Trump said he hadn’t intended to crash Beck’s speech.  “When I walked in, I saw he was at the podium and there were thousands of people in the room. Not too many people were listening to him  —   he’s not a very good guy to listen to, frankly, he’s boring,” Trump said. “And so when I walked in, everybody saw me, the place went crazy. They all ran away from him, his whole crowd, and he was standing up there talking to nobody, and he steamed out of the room,” Trump added. “And I didn’t do it on purpose, but I happened to be there, and I’ll bet you 95 percent of the people in that room in that particular area were with us. ” Trump ultimately won the Nevada caucus by a massive margin, edging   finisher Sen. Marco Rubio by a full 22 points. Cruz finished third with 21. 4 percent. Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter @dznussbaum."
Miami bids farewell to Marlins ace Jose Fernandez," (CNN) A somber Miami on Wednesday bid farewell to Marlins pitching ace Jose Fernandez.  Teammates accompanied his remains during part of a symbolic procession from the place Fernandez established himself as one of the game’s brightest stars to the revered shrine where South Florida’s Cuban diaspora seeks comfort in times of crisis. Fernandez, 24, and two friends were killed in a boating accident early Sunday, a tragedy that stunned Miami and the baseball world.  A native of Santa Clara, Cuba, Fernandez was a beloved figure in the city where so many of his countrymen have settled and prospered.     The funeral procession and public viewing were the latest public tributes to a young man who fled his homeland by boat at the age of 15 and rose to baseball prominence on the other side of the Florida Straits.  On Monday night, in the first game since Fernandez’s death one day earlier, the Marlins honored him in jerseys bearing his name and No. 16.  The emotional night ended with teammates locking arms around the pitcher’s mound    some kneeling in prayer, others wiping tears. They placed their caps on the mound before walking slowly off the field. Throngs in Miami said goodbye on Wednesday. The procession started at 2:16 p. m. in homage to the number on his jersey.  At a square at Marlins Park, his teammates    wearing white RIP   with the pitcher’s photo    surrounded the black hearse carrying Fernandez’s coffin. Marlins hitting coach Barry Bonds led the team in prayer as they placed their hands on the hearse.  The next stop was La Ermita de la Caridad, the shrine to Our Lady of Charity. Devoted to Cuba’s patron saint, the Catholic shrine overlooks Biscayne Bay and points directly to the island.  The procession then moved to St. Brendan Catholic Church for a public viewing in the evening. A private burial will be held Thursday.  As the procession began, fans chanted ”Jose! Jose!” Many waved Cuban flags.   Fernandez and two friends    Emilio Jesus Macias and Eduardo Rivero    were found dead after their boat was discovered at the entrance of Miami Harbor early Sunday, officials said.  Coast Guard personnel on patrol noticed the vessel upside down on the north end of a rocky jetty shortly after 3:15 a. m. according to the  Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, which is investigating the accident.  Drafted by the Marlins in 2011, he rose to become the franchise’s star pitcher, named National League Rookie of the Year 2013 and a    . In 2008, Fernandez made his fourth attempt to flee Cuba, according to a 2013 Miami Herald story. He’d been jailed for a previous failed attempt and, this time, was attempting to reach America, via Mexico, with his mother and sister. Once on the open water, the newspaper reported, someone fell off of the boat, and Fernandez, a good swimmer, asked no questions he jumped in to save the person. It turned out to be his mother, Maritza. ”And you ask yourself, ’Why did this young man, who had been with us for such a brief moment, lead to such an outpouring of grief from a community,” said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said on the Senate floor this week. ”Anywhere you go in Miami, in the last 48 hours, it’s all anyone can talk about.” Rubio on Wednesday asked the US Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers to investigate the safety of the jetty where the accident occurred.

Matthews on New Mexico Trump Protesters: ’I Don’t Think They’re That Violent’ - Breitbart,"On Wednesday, MSNBC’s “Hardball” host Chris Matthews stated of the unrest outside presumptive GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump’s rally in New Mexico, “I don’t think they’re that violent. ”  Matthews said, while talking to Albuquerque Police Officer Tanner Tixier “I don’t see violence yet. I did see that police car with the windshield smashed. I’ve heard about other incidents of violence  —     violence so far. ” After Tixier responded, “I’m not sure what you mean by   violence, Chris. ” Matthews stated, “Well, I don’t see anybody with a face bloodied yet, or I don’t see any danger to anybody yet. ” Tixier continued that people threw rocks, bottles, and shirts that had been lit on fire at officers, and that at that point it looked as though “it’s just a mass riot from people who aren’t necessarily, but just looking to cause some problems. ” After coming back from a commercial break, Matthews said of the protests, “I don’t think they’re that violent. ” And asked, “How do we assess to which Trump is igniting these kinds of things by the locations he’s selecting?” Matthews further asked whether Trump campaigning to the Southwest is “taunting, encouraging. I mean, this happened in Chicago, when they went to an urban school with a large minority population, a large campus population of minorities. Trump chose to have a rally there. He eventually had to shut it down. Is that intentional?” Washington Post National Political Reporter Robert Costa answered, “This is Trump. It’s intentional and it’s from the candidate himself. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"
GOP senators present Obamacare alternative," (CNN) Two Republican senators introduced legislation Monday to replace Obamacare amid mounting pressure on the GOP to craft an alternative to the massive healthcare law. Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Susan Collins of Maine unveiled a bill that they are describing as an ”Obamacare replacement plan.” The duo is promising that the proposal would give more power to the states on health care policy, increase access to affordable insurance and help cover millions of Americans who are currently uninsured. At the core of their proposal: Any state that likes Obamacare can keep it. ”Republicans think that if you like your insurance, you should keep it. And we mean it,” Cassidy said. ”They could opt to stay in Obamacare or they could opt for no federal help. So, California and New York, you love Obamcare? You can keep it.” It is not clear whether the legislation, which is based on a measure Collins and Cassidy introduced in 2015 and has a companion bill in the House from Rep. Pete Sessions, would garner backing from party leadership.  But it is another sign that Republican lawmakers are increasingly feeling the heat to show how they would replace what they roll back the Affordable Care Act. Former President Barack Obama’s signature health care law covers some 20 million people and emerged as one of the most politically divisive issues of his presidency. The fear is that taking action to repeal the law would create deep instability in the insurance markets and potentially result in millions of people’s coverage being disrupted or taken away. Collins, a moderate Republican, has been particularly vocal in insisting that Republicans should not vote to repeal major parts of Obamacare until there is clarity on a replacement plan. She said Monday that it is imperative for Republicans lawmakers to ensure that patients don’t experience ”needless and avoidable gaps in coverage,” and that the party must put forth legislation to replace Obamacare now.  ”We recognize that our bill is not perfect. It is still a work in progress. I expect that we will get many ideas from my colleagues for further refinements and we are completely open to that,” Collins said. ”But if we do not start putting specific legislation on the table that can be debated, refined, amended and enacted, then we will fail the American people.” The   bill, the Louisiana Republican said, would allow states to implement the replacement plan of their choice by 2019: ”By the time 2020 rolls around, everything’s done,” Cassidy said. Democrats are quickly objecting to the new proposal.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Monday afternoon that the   bill was  ”a far cry from the full replacement plan (Republicans) have promised for years.” ”Millions of Americans would be kicked off their plans,    costs and deductibles for consumers would skyrocket,   coverage for working families would be disrupted, and protections for people with   conditions, such as cancer, would be gutted. All while the wealthiest few get a tax cut,” Schumer said in a statement. ”It is nearly impossible to keep the benefits of the Affordable Care Act without keeping the whole thing.” Republicans in Congress have already begun the legislative process of overhauling the law. On Day One of the new Congress, Republican senators used a budget maneuver to start the repeal process, although a final repeal bill is not likely to land on President Donald Trump’s desk for some weeks, even possibly months. And within hours of being sworn in as president, Trump issued an executive order that could eventually have   impact on Obamacare. Among other things, it directs the secretary of health and human services and agencies to interpret regulations as loosely as allowed under the law to minimize the burden on individuals, insurers, health care providers and others.  Collins called the executive order ”very confusing” and difficult to interpret. ”I think that the executive order is very confusing, we really don’t know yet what the impact will be,” she said. "
REVEALED: Imams Preaching Saudi-Imported Hate Texts In British Jails,"Muslim chaplains working within Britain’s prison system have been routinely distributing Islamist hate literature, leaving extremist pamphlets preaching death to   and hatred of the West within easy reach of inmates, a leaked review has revealed. [The Ministry of Justice, who has oversight for chaplaincy appointments within prisons, is understood to have issued an urgent internal alert warning of “severe reputation damage” thanks to the extremist nature of the material.  The compact discs (CDs) and leaflets, some of which were imported from Saudi Arabia, contain homophobic and misogynistic messages, as well as inciting hatred against   and Western culture. Yet it was left by the Muslim chaplains on library bookshelves where inmates were free to come and peruse it, The Times has reported. Lack of scrutiny inside the jails paired with weak corporate guidance meant that there was very little or even no assessment of the material before it was released to “impressionable minds” the leaked report said. And it found that the chaplains at several jails had been encouraging inmates to raise funds for Islamic charities with links to extremist organisations and international terrorism, warning that failings at senior levels within the prison service had created a breeding ground for Islamic radicalisation. Others of Britain’s approximately 100 Muslim chaplains were unaware of their statutory duty to prevent inmates being drawn into extremism, or were   to take on   work “sometimes because they lacked the capability but often because they didn’t have the will”. The report comes just days after some high security prisons were found to have ‘Sharia blocks,’ where former terrorists and Islamic extremists were taking over and imposing Sharia law on   inmates. Overall, it is said to have “pulled no punches” taking to task the National Offender Management Service (Noms) the Ministry of Justice executive body that oversees prisons. “Nobody there has been brave enough to confront and tackle this pernicious ideology,” a Whitehall insider said. The review, led by a former senior Home Office official and ordered by Justice Secretary Michael Gove, has not yet been released as it is still awaiting clearance from No 10. A summarised version was due to be released last month but has been postponed. For the last 13 years the process for appointing Muslim chaplains has been overseen by Ahtsham Ali, the prison service’s Muslim adviser. He has previously held senior roles in British organisations with strong links to India’s    movement, founded by the Islamist theologist Abul Ala Maududi. Yet despite the report’s findings, Michael Spurr, Noms chief executive, has issued a letter insisting that Mr Ali retained the confidence and support of the organisation. Meanwhile concern is growing regarding the   within the prison service of chaplains drawn from the Deobandi sect, another Islamic sect founded in India, and the influence they may have on the 12, 328 Muslim inmates held in English and Welsh jails, particularly the 1, 000 deemed vulnerable to radicalisation. The Deobandis are the largest sect in the UK, controlling 600 of the UK’s 1, 500 mosques, the majority of Britain’s Muslim schools, and turning out 80 percent of all domestically trained scholars. 70 percent of Muslim prison chaplains were trained in Deobandi seminaries. But although it claims to be moderate, it has hosted the hate preachers who trained the   bombers, while its schools have been caught disseminating   and misogynistic literature. An offshoot, the slightly more   Tablighi Jamaat, has been described by some as an “Army of Darkness”."
Ted Cruz Would Un-Suspend In Event Of Miraculous Nebraska ‘Path To Victory’ - Breitbart,"Sen. Ted Cruz says he would consider   the GOP presidential nominating contest if, against his assumptions, he wins Nebraska’s primary today. [The Texas senator suspended his campaign for the Republican presidential one week ago after a loss in Indiana.  “We came up short in this election, I would have preferred it otherwise. The movement still continues and that’s what gives me encouragement,” said Cruz in a Tuesday morning interview on the Glenn Beck radio program on SiriusXM. Later in the interview Cruz expressed a desire to see a “President we can trust. ” He spoke of temperament saying, “we need to watch and see what the candidates say and do. ” That spurred the question to Cruz from Beck sidekick Pat Gray: would the Texas senator consider getting back in the Republican primary race if Nebraskans “miraculously” voted Cruz the winner in the state’s primary election that same day. “I am not holding my breath. My assumption is that that will not happen,” replied Cruz. But listen, let’s be very clear, if there is a path to victory, we launched this campaign intending to win. The reason we suspended the race last week is with Indiana’s loss I didn’t see a viable path to victory. If that changes, we will certainly respond accordingly. Earlier in the interview Cruz said that while the result of the Republican nomination process was not what he had hoped for he and wife Heidi were thankful for the opportunity to be a “part of what was just an incredible grassroots movement. ” The suspended 2016 presidential candidate hit hard on the role of the media. This election will be studied for the role of the media and in particular network executives, that they made in terms of promoting the candidate that they had chosen, they wanted to win. Trump has received now over $3 billion in free airtime. Strikingly, ya know that last 30 days, he had $500 billion dollars in free airtime, 90 percent of which was positive. To put that in perspective in the entire 13 months of the campaign, the aggregate coverage of my campaign was about $500 billion dollars worth. That has a dramatic effect on the polls when every network becomes effectively the SuperPAC for the candidate they want to win the nomination and we’re about to see that same ferocious fury now turn against Donald in an effort to elect Hillary. And there’s now doubt we need to think hard about what is the role of a handful of network executives in manipulating and trying to deceive the voters because I think it’s a very dangerous dynamic we have right now. Beck also told Cruz that his organization has been inundated with people either wanting Cruz to run third party (Beck said he didn’t think Cruz would do that) or wanting Cruz to support Trump. Beck commented, “we can’t do that. ” He asked Cruz what the senator thinks his supporters should do. This is a choice every voter is going to have to make and I would note that it’s not a choice that we as the voters have to make today. The Republican convention isn’t for another two and a half months. The election isn’t for another six months. You and I both want to support a conservative. We want to support someone who will get the burden of Washington off of small businesses and bring back jobs and economic growth. We want to support someone who will defend the Constitution, defend the Bill of Rights, religious liberty, the second amendment. We want to defend someone who will stand by our friends and allies including especially the nation of Israel. We want to defend someone who will be a strong, serious Commander In Chief. Cruz indicated that the conservative movement was divided during the election. “I think the conservative movement remains strong and vibrant,” said Cruz, who said that when conservatives are divided they are less effective. This fight was about a lot more than one campaign or one candidate. This fight is about principles that are eternal. The free market principles that built America, that allowed millions of small businesses to lift hundreds of millions out of poverty and to prosperity. Those principles are as true today as they were every day of our country’s history. The constitutional liberties in the Bill of Rights that protect our   rights from being violated by the federal government. Those rights are true and as valid today as they have been throughout history. And so the movement continues. What my energy is directed at, what my focus is directed at is continuing to strengthen and speak for that movement. Cruz was asked about a celebrity factor in this election and the possibility of a Will     ticket in the future. Cruz replied, “One of the disturbing things of this election, and there are many, is it opens the door potentially for what comes next and what comes next is not likely to be sound, stable leaders with good judgement and the understanding of the problems facing this country, our economy and the challenges and threats facing us across the world. ” Cruz said his next step is heading back to Washington to go back to the U. S. Senate and fight for the jobs, freedom and security platform he ran on during his presidential campaign. When asked about the possibility of a third party run for those that “think like” him, Cruz said, “I don’t think that’s very likely. ” He said he does think that it’s imperative to get the burden of Washington off of the back of small businesses. “I’m very dismayed that the odds are increasing that we simply keep going down the same road, we don’t fix those problems and people end up hurting even more. ” He said that is where is focus is going to be in returning to the Senate. “I believe we’re going to accomplish that, but it just may take more time. ” Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana "
Let’s hear the full Brian Williams story," (CNN) NBC and Brian Williams have more explaining to do if they expect viewers to hand over their trust a second time.  The network announced Thursday that Williams will return in August as an anchor on MSNBC and a backup anchor for NBC in what NBC News Chairman Andy Lack said is a chance to earn back the public’s trust. After questions arose regarding the accuracy of Williams’ statements, NBC News assigned its top investigative producer to wade through his past and discover exaggerations and misstatements he has made on ”Dateline NBC,” ”NBC Nightly News” and a range of   comedy shows, public appearances and radio talk shows. But NBC is keeping its findings to itself and is only saying that yes, they found inaccuracies in what Williams had said, but that most of those statements were not made on news programs.   There are several places where the network’s handling of Williams’ case falls short:  • When CBS had an independent investigation look into Dan Rather’s reporting for ”60 Minutes II,” the network published a     report that led to four firings and Rather’s undoing. When Rolling Stone asked the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism to investigate the magazine’s reporting on campus rape, the ugly truth emerged in detail in a public release and news conference. NBC should release the findings of its investigation.  • NBC is moving Williams to MSNBC. But wait. Does that mean the network has lower or different ethics standards for its cable network? Is that how MSNBC gives activist Al Sharpton a show of his own when it bans other anchors from being activists? Why does the network have different ethics standards for different channels when the two cross lines so often? Just explain it to us.   • NBC should use this opportunity to tell its anchors to ”Just say ’No’” to invitations to appear on   comedy shows. In February, CBS’ Scott Pelley told the Los Angeles Times: ”I don’t think it’s appropriate for journalists to appear on entertainment programming. There’s too much of a risk for the audience to think, ’Wait a minute    is it scripted? Is it not? Are you telling me the truth? Is it acting?’ That’s a big, red line for me, and I never have crossed it.”  Before it’s too late    if it’s not already    and before the public completely dismisses broadcast news as mere entertainment, let’s tell anchors to ”Be like Scott.” Just do the news. Don’t appear in movies or skits or yuck it up with radio programs. It’s not about being a stuffed shirt. It is about being a newsman. In that same Los Angeles Times article, Pelley mentioned that every night he thinks to himself that some CBS journalist somewhere risked his or her life to get a story on the air that day.  Don’t undermine that work by doing something that is   but adds nothing to the public discourse or important topics.  When politicians and celebrities find themselves in trouble, journalists circle in the water until the subject comes clean    sometimes in a tense, tearful news conference. It isn’t enough to appear on your own network’s morning program and answer questions from your pal. (Williams said in a taped interview with Matt Lauer on the ”Today” show Friday that his ego caused him to say things that were not true.) Williams should stand up, face the cameras and come clean by answering reporters’ questions.  It would be tough, but it would show he’s a   guy and that he understands why people are upset with him. It would give him a chance to say what he will do differently. Experts in public apologies say an apology should include ”regret, responsibility and remedy.”   I want Williams to make a comeback. I believe in second chances and redemption. The process begins with answering questions, not ducking them. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook. .

Jerry Seinfeld Slammed for ’Offensive’ Black’s Life Matters Tweet - Breitbart,"Comedian Jerry Seinfeld’s tweet to promote the new season of his comedy series, Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, offended social media users.

And it’s likely due to the fact that the    star is no fan of what he calls “politically correct nonsense. ” In 2014, Seinfeld slammed the idea of creating comedy strictly through the lens of race, gender, or one’s sexual preference. “It’s more about PC nonsense than ‘Are you making us laugh or not? ’” he said. A year later, Seinfeld doubled down on his   remarks, noting that contemporary college students carelessly use the terms “racist” or “sexist. ” “They just want to use these words,” Seinfeld told radio host Colin Cowhard. “‘That’s racist. That’s sexist. That’s prejudice.’ They don’t even know what they’re fucking talking about. ” Seinfeld’s Comedians, in which the comic riding in a car and sitting in diners sharing a cup of coffee with his famous friends, debuted in July 2012. Seinfeld recently signed a deal to bring the the comedy series to streaming giant Netflix. The 9th season of  Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee premiered on January 5.

Buchanan: ’I Don’t Believe’ Trump Has a Recording Device - But ’He Ought to Have One’ - Breitbart,".@PatrickBuchanan: ”I don’t believe [@POTUS’s] got a tape recording device, but let me say this   I think he ought to have one.” pic. twitter.  Saturday on Fox News Channel’s “Bulls  Bears,” conservative commentator Pat Buchanan, who was also a White House aide during the Nixon administration, was skeptical of the possibility of President Donald Trump having a recording device.  Many have argued he alleged having such a device in a tweet about his interactions with   FBI Director James Comey. James Comey better hope that there are no ”tapes” of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017,  Buchanan said he didn’t think Trump had a recording device in the Oval Office, but suggested that he should and noted that some of his predecessors going all the way back to President John F. Kennedy had them. “I don’t believe he’s got a tape recording device, but let me say this  —   I think he ought to have one,” Buchanan said. “Look, he meets with [Sergey] Lavrov, people like that. Things are said that are important. Jack Kennedy had a taping system. Lyndon Johnson had one. ” Buchanan argued there was a distinction between Richard Nixon’s taped conversations and those that Johnson and Kennedy used. “The problem with Nixon’s was they were ” he said. “If I walked into the Oval Office and started talking to the president, you’re being taped, whereas Kennedy would through a switch and Johnson would throw a switch. But presidents have to have a record of what they say to foreign leaders. I don’t think anyone would object to that. My guess is that there was no taping done. ” As for asking Comey if he were under investigation, Buchanan did not fault Trump for the question given that it had been used to damage Trump’s reputation. “But I will say this  —   when Donald Trump asks the FBI Director, ‘Am I under investigation?’ I was not outraged by that. He has spent 10 months with the suspicion created and pushed in the press that Donald Trump and [Vladimir] Putin conspired to get into Podesta’s emails and that’s damaged the president. And the president has a right to have that cleared up. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"

"Saudi minister rips White House on Syria, talks 2016 campaign"," (CNN) A top Saudi Arabian official visiting Washington gave his full backing Friday to State Department officials protesting the White House’s refusal to directly confront the regime of Syrian President Bashar  .  Saudi Foreign Minister Adel   spoke a day after 51 State Department staff involved in Mideast issues sharply criticized the Obama administration’s Syria policy in a formal, classified memo as ineffective and urged a tougher stance, including airstrikes against the Syrian regime.  ”We’ve been arguing for that since the beginning of the crisis,”   said. He detailed the options Saudi leaders have advocated for, including airstrikes, a   zone, safe haven and more robust arming of the Syrian opposition, including    missiles. ”We continue to believe unless we change the balance of power in a dramatic way, that once we do that it will open the way for a political solution,”   said. RELATED: State Department officials call for military action in Syria, A senior U. S. administration official pushed back against the Saudi foreign minister’s remarks, however, saying the administration made its decisions based on U. S. interests, not those of other countries.  ”There’s no question that the Saudis have been pushing us to get more involved militarily since the start of the Syrian conflict, and the reason is simple: They want us to do the fighting for them,” the official said. ”But if we’ve learned anything over the past   years, it’s that we must not allow ourselves be drawn into protracted conflicts, especially in the Middle East.” In his remarks to reporters at the Saudi Arabian Embassy in D. C.   also pushed back against criticism from Hillary Clinton and skirted questions about the future of relations with the U. S. under a possible President Donald Trump.  Clinton, the Democratic Party’s presumptive nominee, called out Saudi Arabia this week in Cleveland, saying that ”it is long past time for the Saudis, the Qataris and the Kuwaitis and others to stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations. And they should stop supporting radical schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path towards extremism.” Those comments,   said, were ”exaggerated and I think, frankly, they’re not fair.”  ”Nobody can question the kingdom’s commitment to fighting terrorism or the financing of terrorism,”   said, adding some praise for Clinton’s ”tremendous experience.”   is in Washington to accompany Saudi Deputy Crown Prince and Defense Minister Mohammad bin Salman as he made the rounds of the White House, Congress, Pentagon and other key Cabinet agencies such as state, energy and treasury.  The Saudi visit comes as ties with the U. S. have been strained and Riyahd has come in for direct and indirect criticism, with calls for the release of classified information on the possible involvement of Saudis in the Sept. 11 attacks and legislation in Congress that would make countries like the kingdom liable for damages in terror attacks.    also defended Saudi Arabia’s efforts to promote tolerance and said that if mosques funded by his country were ”later on taken over by extremists, that should be the responsibility of the local government, not the donor country.”  Asked whether Trump’s comments about Muslims or his proposed ban on their entry to the U. S. would affect the relationship with Saudi Arabia,   was diplomatic.  ”The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s relationship with the United States is a bipartisan one,” he said. ”The one constant is that with every decade it grows stronger, broader and deeper.”   also said that his country had records that Omar Mateen, the killer responsible for the deaths of 49 people at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub Sunday, had visited Saudi Arabia twice, but that he ”didn’t know that he was on any radar screen” or whether his country’s security services have investigated him.

Letter From Former Officials Urges Donald Trump to Detail Foreign Dealings - The New York Times,"More than 50 former government officials and national security and military figures have signed an open letter to Donald J. Trump, urging him to disclose details of his overseas business investments before Election Day. The letter  —   signed by dozens of supporters of the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton  —   was drafted as Mr. Trump, the Republican pick who is reported to have extensive overseas entanglements, has refused to release his tax returns. Michael J. Morell, a former acting director of the C. I. A. and Michael G. Vickers, a former under secretary of defense for intelligence, put together the letter with input from Samantha Vinograd, a former senior adviser to Thomas E. Donilon, a former national security adviser. “Donald Trump still has not revealed to the American public his international business relationships, even as it becomes increasingly clear that his overseas ties could well constitute significant conflicts of interest when it comes to charting U. S. foreign policy,” the letter reads. “This is unprecedented for a candidate for the nation’s highest office. As such, we are calling on Mr. Trump to disclose, in full, the nature of his business relationships overseas  —   to include specifically who his business partners are and what and where are his foreign investments. ” The signers  —   who also include prominent Republicans such as Michael Chertoff, who led the Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush, and Paul D. Wolfowitz, Mr. Bush’s deputy secretary of defense  —   add that Mr. Trump should “pledge that he will divest himself of his overseas business interests should he win the presidency. ” In a comment after this article was published, Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, singled out one of the letter’s relatively   signers for criticism, without directly addressing the substance of the letter. “If Wendy Sherman is the definition of who is considered a reliable government official, this letter and its signatories lose all credibility,” Mr. Miller said. “Sherman was appointed to the State Department by Hillary Clinton during her disastrous tenure and was the lead negotiator in opening up Iran —  the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism —  for business, ultimately funding terrorist activities and exporting violence around the world. ” He added, “Based on her complete failure in representing American foreign policy and deep ties to Secretary Clinton, this letter epitomizes the rigged system in Washington that has continued to fail Americans over and over again. ” Mrs. Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, recently announced changes that would take place at the Clinton Foundation, which relies heavily on foreign donations, in an effort to eliminate the potential for the appearance of conflicts of interest if she becomes president. Those changes were announced after Mrs. Clinton faced intense scrutiny, including from Mr. Trump, over the foundation’s foreign donations. Mr. Morell, a supporter of Mrs. Clinton who worked with her while she was secretary of state, said he and Mr. Vickers sought the letter after Newsweek reported that Mr. Trump has had business dealings with questionable figures in China, India and Russia, and claimed to have had negotiations with Col. Muammar   before he was toppled as the dictator of Libya. “On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian leadership, while outlining policies that read like a Kremlin wish list,” the letter reads, referring to the president of Russia. “He has claimed that Putin would never invade Ukraine, suggested permanently ceding Crimea to Russia and placed conditions on upholding our obligation to protect our NATO allies,” according to the letter. “He has floated lifting sanctions against Russia, which would benefit both Putin and the Trump Organization. ” The signers wrote that the next president would take office at a complicated moment globally, adding: “Our policies must be motivated exclusively by what is in America’s best interest, not by the financial interests of our president. The onus is on Donald Trump to assure voters that this will be the case by disclosing the nature of his overseas relationships and committing to divest such assets. ”"
Trump administration returning Senate torture report," (CNN) The CIA, CIA inspector general and director of national intelligence will return their copies of the Senate Intelligence Committee’s massive   report on the CIA’s interrogation and detention program under the George W. Bush administration, a Senate aide confirmed to CNN on Friday. The decision means it’s highly unlikely the report    which concluded that interrogation techniques such as waterboarding did not elicit useful intelligence from detainees    will be made public so long as Republicans control the Senate and the White House. Democrats are concerned it will never see the light of day if the copies are destroyed. The report, written under   chairwoman Sen. Dianne Feinstein when Democrats controlled the Senate, has remained classified, except for an executive summary that was released when the report was completed in 2014. The report concluded that interrogation techniques such as waterboarding did not elicit useful intelligence from detainees. The Senate report was sent to federal agencies in the hope that it could eventually be made public, but committee chairman Richard Burr,   Carolina, has asked the administration to return the copies to the Senate. The DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that the report was a congressional record, which is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act, which Burr said was why he has asked that the agencies return the documents.  ”I have directed my staff to retrieve copies of the congressional study that remain with the Executive Branch agencies and, as the committee does with all classified and compartmented information, will enact the necessary measures to protect the sensitive sources and methods contained within the report,” Burr said in a statement. Republicans have criticized the report as unfairly targeting the CIA and ignoring the intelligence gained under the interrogation program. The administration’s decision to return the reports to the Senate was first reported by The New York Times. The intelligence panel’s Democrats slammed the Trump administration for giving the copies back, and Burr for making the demand they be returned. Sen. Mark Warner, top Democrat on the committee, said he was ”very disappointed” by the decision. ”This study must be preserved for history, and the Senate intelligence committee will continue to conduct vigorous oversight of our nation’s intelligence agencies to ensure that they abide by both the spirit and the letter of the law that bans the practices outlined in the report,” he said in a statement. Feinstein called Burr’s move ”divisive” and claimed Democrats on the committee had not been notified or consulted. ”No senator    chairman or not    has the authority to erase history,” the California Democrat said. ”I believe that is the intent of the chairman in this case.” And Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon accused Burr and the Trump administration of seeking to ”pave the way for the kind of falsehoods used to justify an illegal and dangerous torture program.” ”For the sake of future generations of Americans, this report should be immediately returned to the government agencies who gave it up, disseminated widely within the government and most importantly, declassified for the American people,” Wyden said in a statement. The American Civil Liberties Union sued to make the full report public, but its case was dismissed. ”It would be a travesty for agencies to return the CIA torture report instead of reading and learning from it, as senators intended,” said Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU’s National Security Project. The committee sent the report to seven federal agencies: the CIA, CIA inspector general, FBI, director of national intelligence and the Justice, State and Defense Departments. But even if all those copies are returned to the committee, there is another way the report could eventually be made public. When President Barack Obama was still in office, the White House felt it was caught between congressional Democrats who wanted the full report made public and the CIA and intelligence community that felt strongly against it, according to a former administration official. But in December, the White House declared the document a presidential record, which means it’s part of the Obama presidential record, which remains classified for 12 years. ”It doesn’t mean it will be automatically declassified after 12 years, but at least in this case, a copy will be preserved,” the official said."
United flight 1074 turns back after passenger subdued,"Dulles, Virginia (CNN) Two   passengers in the third row of a United flight to Denver tackled and subdued a man who was heading toward the cockpit, other travelers on the plane told CNN on Tuesday. The incident started shortly after United Flight 1074 took off around 10:15 p. m. Monday from Dulles International Airport in suburban Washington. The Boeing 737 jet was supposed to take its 33 passengers and six crew members to Denver, but turned back because the unnamed passenger ”failed to comply with crew instructions,” United Airlines spokesman Luke Punzenberger said.  Joshua Lindstrom told ”Anderson Cooper 360˚” Tuesday night that a man was acting strangely as he moved up the aisle. ”The flight attendant gave some sort of command to stand back, and he turned and started heading toward the cockpit. And the guy in 3E was a lightning bolt and just jumped out of his seat and took the guy down to the ground.” The hero’s seatmate piled on and grabbed the    passenger’s legs, Lindstrom said.  Passenger Donna Tellam told CNN’s ”Erin Burnett OutFront” the men reacted so quickly she thought they were air marshals. She said the unruly man had come down the aisle, screaming about the plane going too slow and flailing his arms.  A flight attendant used plastic ties to bind the man’s wrists as the plane headed back, she said.  Earlier, a government official with direct knowledge of the incident told CNN that the detained passenger had run toward the cockpit screaming ”jihad, jihad.”  Lindstrom told Cooper he didn’t hear those words but after the flight was back on the ground the man who tackled the unruly passenger mentioned it. ”He said, ’Did you hear it?  Like he said ’jihad’ a couple times (while he was being restrained),” Lindstrom said. ”. .. In the end it was more surreal than it was scary. It was wild.” Lindstrom said two other people helped keep the man on the floor for the 20 minutes or so that it took the flight crew to return to Dulles. During that time, the subdued man’s mood would change. The man was rattling on about someone trying to bring the plane down, then become despondent and cry, ”I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” A cell phone video shows the man, bruised on his face, being held down. At one point, he pleads, ”Please stop, please stop, they said call it off.” At another, the man seems to cry as he says, ”I’m so sorry.” ”Don’t move,” one passenger says, apparently trying to calm the man. ”You’re OK. We’re going to get you off this plane, buddy.”  The plane returned to Dulles around 10:40 p. m. said Kimberly Gibbs, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, which runs the northern Virginia airport.  Airport police took the unruly passenger off the plane, and airport   transported him to a nearby hospital, according to Gibbs. As of late Tuesday evening, the passenger had not been arrested or charged with a crime, officials said. There is nothing, so far, in the tackled man’s background to suggest he has a connection to terrorists, the government source said. No weapons were found after he was subdued. By then, the other passengers    none of whom was injured    had been rebooked on new   flights. Some opted to take the first flight to Colorado on Tuesday, while others chose to leave later, according to Punzenberger, the United spokesman. Opinion: Pilot: How safe are you on a plane?"

He cofounded PayPal and invested early in Facebook, and is worth about $2. 7 billion, .’ ”But one of the biggest turning points in Thiel’s early career was actually a rejection, as  noted on Friday.” ’Specifically, Thiel was turned down for clerkship positions under US Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy and the late Justice Antonin Scalia.’ ’Thiel discusses the missed opportunity  —   and the opportunity that it created  —   in his book, ”Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future,” :’ ”Naturally, Thiel did end up doing pretty well for himself.  reveals that Thiel’s year of appellate clerkship followed his graduation from Stanford Law in 1992.” ’”Then I came back to California to start a business and basically do something other than the professional legal track,” Thiel said.’ ’After he spent some time as a derivatives trader, he started his own investment fund in 1996 and cofounded PayPal shortly thereafter in 1998.’ ’Unsurprisingly, Thiel doesn’’t look back too sadly at missing out on the clerk position. He elaborates in ”Zero to One,” saying that, in hindsight, ”winning that ultimate competition [for the clerkship] would have changed my life for the worse. ”’ ’A position in the court, Thiel speculated, would have brought a ”career taking depositions and drafting other people’’s business deals instead of creating anything new. ”’ ’Peter Thiel has done pretty well for himself. ...’"
"U.S., Russian aircraft came within 10 feet","Washington (CNN) A Russian fighter jet, flying at high speed, came within 10 feet of a U. S. Air Force reconnaissance aircraft in international airspace over the Black Sea late last month, several U. S. officials told CNN Thursday. The Russian jet flew alongside the U. S. plane at the same altitude, broke off, and then shadowed the plane before leaving the area in the May 30 incident, the officials said. The U. S. aircraft took no evasive measures, and no other details were immediately available. Military officials could not say whether a diplomatic protest had been filed. The close call comes weeks after another incident between the U. S. and Russia over the skies of Europe, when a U. S.   flying a routine route in international airspace was intercepted by a Russian   Flanker in what authorities called an ”unsafe and unprofessional manner.” And earlier this month, the U. S. Navy took the unusual step of releasing video of Russian   aircraft flying past the right side of the guided missile destroyer USS Ross in the Black Sea. The video was distributed to make clear that the airplanes and ship had a routine encounter, contrary to Russian reports. It shows a warplane approaching from the distance and then quickly zooming past the American vessel. The Russian aircraft were not armed, according to a U. S. defense official, and the entire matter was considered routine. The U. S. officials say because there are more military aircraft from NATO and Russia flying over the Black Sea and the Baltics, there are more interactions. However, the two air incidents are of particular concern because of the danger they posed to U. S. aircraft and personnel."
California Today: How Badly Do You Want That New Rail Line? - The New York Times,"Good morning. We’re trying something new this week: California Today, a morning update for our California readers. Tell us what you’d like to see: CAtoday@nytimes. com Across California, public transit agencies are pushing ballot measures in search of money for just about everything related to transit: new rail lines, highway widening and even pothole filling. Santa Clara County will vote in November on a   sales tax to finance transportation projects. Similar measures will be on the ballot in Sacramento County and, very likely, San Diego County. Possibly several other Bay Area counties as well. Los Angeles County decided last week to put a   tax on the ballot for the third time in just eight years. These small sales tax increases have become perhaps the only realistic way to pay for ambitious transportation projects, said Brian D. Taylor, a professor of urban planning at U. C. L. A. “Voters and elected officials have become very hostile to increases in fuel taxes,” he said. In 2008, voters in Los Angeles approved a   sales tax increase for 30 years. That has financed projects like the   rail line connecting downtown to the beach, which just opened. (Never mind that the trip is often still faster by car.) Four years later, voters rejected a plan to extend that Los Angeles County sales tax another 30 years. Now we’re headed to the ballot box again  —   only this time, the sales tax hike would be permanent. • With concerns about climate change growing, Oakland banned the transport and storage of large coal shipments, halting a plan to a use a former Army base to ship coal to China and other overseas markets. • After last week’s Supreme Court ruling, will undocumented immigrants in California, and around the country, go back to avoiding the authorities?

In the continental United States, they live only in Yellowstone National Park and a few other remote locations. The bears, the group said, would not be running around downtown San Francisco. They could be safely reintroduced in the remote Sierra Nevada. On its website, the group describes grizzlies as eating mostly nuts, berries, fish and small animals, and only “the occasional person who pokes a camera in their face. ” (Not exactly reassuring.) This past week, a black bear, known as a skittish animal, clawed its way into a tent and scratched a man who was camping about 30 miles from Los Angeles. Grizzlies are far larger and more aggressive than black bears. For now, federal and state officials, convinced that a   grizzly bear would eventually end up in a campground, have not yet shown interest in bringing them back.

Pope on Easter: Use ‘Weapons of Love’ to Combat Brutal Violence of Muslim Terror,"In his Easter message to the world on Sunday, Pope Francis condemned terrorism as “a blind and brutal violence,” while proposing that it should be fought with “weapons of love. ”[The Pope was delivering his “Urbi et Orbi” (To the City and the World) message before some 70, 000 pilgrims and tourists who braved tight security to be able to hear the Pope in and around Saint Peter’s Square in Vatican City.  The message has been posted on the Vatican’s website in Arabic, Italian, German, French and Portuguese, but curiously not in English. Pope Francis prayed that the Lord Jesus might embolden all Christians in this Easter holiday to stand close to the victims of terrorism, “a blind and brutal form of violence that continues to shed innocent blood in different parts of the world, as has happened in recent attacks in Belgium, Turkey, Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Iraq. ” “With the weapons of love, God has defeated selfishness and death and His Son Jesus is the door of mercy wide open for everyone,” Francis said. The Pope also said that the Risen Christ “invites us not to forget the men and women on their journey in search of a better future, increasingly great waves of migrants and refugees —  including many children —  fleeing from war, hunger, poverty and social injustice. ” These brothers and sisters of ours, he said, “too often encounter death or rejection from those who could offer them hospitality and help. ” Francis also reached out in his address to “our brothers and sisters who are persecuted for their faith and for their loyalty to the name of Christ,” telling them to remember the consoling words of the Lord: “Do not be afraid!

Whoops! Hillary Clinton Cancels Planned Trip To Charlotte After Mayor Begs Her To Stay Home - Breitbart,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was forced to cancel her planned trip to Charlotte, after the Democratic mayor of the city begged her on live television to stay home. [Clinton aides announced on Friday afternoon that Hillary would visit the city on Sunday, but were forced to reverse their plans just hours later.  “After further discussion with community leaders, we have decided to postpone Sunday’s trip as to not impact the city’s resources,” noted Clinton’s communications director Jennifer Palmieri in a carefully worded statement released late Friday night. Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts, a Democrat who has endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, urged the Democratic nominee to postpone her scheduled visit on Sunday in an interview on CNN. She indicated that both presidential candidates were considering a visit to Charlotte, although Clinton was the only candidate who had announced her plans. “If there would be a way to delay those visits in terms of giving us a chance to get our city back to order and back to a state of normalcy that would probably be ideal,” Roberts said in an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett on Friday night. Although Donald Trump was also considering a visit to Charlotte after the first presidential debate, his campaign also abandoned their plans. Roberts said she appreciated that the presidential candidates were concerned about the city, but said an early visit would stress the city’s resources. “At this point we do have very stressed resources for security,” she said. “They are working around the clock. ” Clinton planned visit would have taken place the same day that Charlotte will be hosting an NFL football game, as the Minnesota Vikings play the Panthers. The event will likely be the focal point for additional protests. The Clinton campaign indicated in their statement that Hillary will visit Charlotte the following Sunday.   Trump reacted to the news on Twitter, ridiculing the candidate for not contacting the community first. Crooked Hillary’s bad judgement forced her to announce that she would go to Charlotte on Saturday to grandstand. Dem pols said no way, dumb!  —   Donald J.

California Today: $2 More for a Pack of Cigarettes? - The New York Times,"Good morning. Welcome to California Today, a morning update on the stories that matter to Californians (and anyone else interested in the state). Tell us about the issues that matter to you  —   and what you’d like to see: CAtoday@nytimes. com. Want to receive California Today by email? Sign up. Raise taxes. Lower the number of smokers. That’s the idea at the heart of a November ballot initiative that supporters say could save thousands of lives from   health issues. A “yes” vote on Proposition 56 would add $2 to the existing tax on a pack of cigarettes, bringing it to a total state tax of $2. 87 per pack. It would be the first tax increase on cigarettes in California since 1998. “This is a long overdue hike,” said Tom Steyer, a philanthropist and leader of the Yes on 56 campaign. “And if you don’t smoke, you don’t pay. ” Raising cigarette prices has proved to reduce smoking, public health experts say. California’s taxation of cigarettes has lagged behind most states. In Texas, the tax has been $1. 41 a pack since 2007. New York charges $4. 35, the highest amount in the country. Critics have portrayed such taxes as another example of state overreach and say such efforts unfairly target   smokers. But the central argument against the California measure has focused more on where the additional money will go. “It’s really a tax hike grab by insurance companies, hospital corporations and other wealthy special interests,” said Beth Miller, a spokeswoman for the “No on 56 campaign. Supporters say the goal is to cut smoking, but the measure would also help to shore up health care funding. According to the Legislative Analyst’s Office, the tax increase would generate more than $1 billion, most of it allocated to   the coverage plan for   Californians. Multiple attempts to raise California’s cigarette tax at the ballot box and in the Legislature have failed over the years. As with past efforts, Proposition 56 supporters are bracing for a media blitz  —   bankrolled by more than 55 million from R. J. Reynolds and Philip Morris. Stanton Glantz, a professor of medicine at U. C. San Francisco whose research focuses on tobacco, said Proposition 56, crucially, sets aside funds for the state’s   programs. California already has the nation’s   per capita smoking rate, with only about 10 percent continuing to light up. If the initiative passes, Professor Glantz said, “I think that we will end up with smoking that is so low that the behavior will simply collapse. ” See reporting in The New York Times on other Nov. 8 ballot initiatives: Proposition 51 (a new school bond) | Propositions 62 and 66 (death penalty questions) | Propositions 65 and 67 (on banning plastic bags).

[The New York Times] The Giants put a statue of Willie Mays in front of their San Francisco ballpark. The San Diego Chargers’ stadium has one for Jack Murphy, the great sportswriter. Outside Staples Center is a statue of Kareem   among other sports heroes. And this week, the Sacramento Kings unveiled a statue of their own at their new arena  —   a giant, brightly colored interpretation of Piglet, the diminutive but   pal of Winnie the Pooh, designed by the   pop artist Jeff Koons. The choice has been a contentious one. After the plan to acquire the sculpture was announced last year, some critics called the artwork’s childlike theme  . Others took aim at the cost  —   $8 million  —   as well as the hiring of an    Mr. Koons, to create it. But the Kings organization and its owners, who put up most of the money, have stood by it. Vivek Ranadivé, the team’s majority owner, said in an interview with The Sacramento Bee last year that the statue “will be a symbol of hope and optimism, which will represent the aspirations of Sacramento as well. ” The   sculpture called “Coloring Book” was intended to evoke the Piglet character from the A. A. Milne books, with bright colors as if drawn by a child. On Monday, during the unveiling ceremony near the main entrance to the arena, called Golden 1 Center, Mr. Koons spoke about art’s power to influence the viewer. “You have a sense of transcendence, how you can become more,” he said. Sacramento is not the only team dabbling in   art. Daniel McDermon, a culture editor for The Times, writes about how the art world is increasingly becoming a player in the sports world. Outside the arena on Thursday,   gave some initial reviews. “I know I can’t draw a straight line, but I could do that,” said James Lincoln, a Kings fan. Standing nearby, Naborn Ward, also a Kings fan, said the team shouldn’t have spent more than a few thousand dollars for the artwork. Asked what would make a better statue, he said, “I would have done something with sports  —   a sports hero, something, anything, you know  —   not Piglet. ” California Today goes live at 6 a. m.

Ariana Rowlands On The Milo Show: Why Sanders Fans Backed The College Republicans - Breitbart,"Ariana Rowlands from the UC Irvine College Republicans was adamant on the Milo Yiannopoulos Show that while the society had been reinstated to its previous position, the battle was not yet over. [After Breitbart Tech Editor Milo Yiannopoulos spoke at UC Irvine, the College Republicans were informed in an email from the university that they were suspended for year, citing the group’s alleged failure to provide a certificate of insurance for the private security hired for the event to protect Milo. However, the group previously hosted conservative pundit David Horowitz, who also required private security, but the group were never asked to provide an insurance certificate, and were not penalised for not doing so.  Unfortunately for the UC Irvine administration, they faced a massive backlash, both on and off campus, resulting in the University quickly backtracking and reinstating all of the society’s privileges. In an unprecedented move, the Bernie Sanders supporters at Irvine backed the College Republicans in their struggle against the administration. Rowlands said to Milo that she has a “lot of respect for them because we don’t agree on anything politically,” apart from, it seems, free speech, and revealed that the two groups “would be working together in future. ” Milo suggested that a good move would be for both groups to invite their “most dangerous speaker” and have a proper,   debate, the likes of which have not been seen on US college campuses for a long while. Ariana agreed, claiming that such a debate would give the students “the education that they deserve but that they’re not getting. ” Ariana went on to detail the next move of the CR group, noting that a lot of small   fights are being won across the US, but there is never any progress made as a result, only a return to the status quo with the same threat of censorship being hung over their heads. “We’re not going to let it go,” Ariana proclaimed defiantly to Milo. The CR are demanding that all institutions in the University of California system release a resolution to ensure that there is “no more discrimination based on political philosophy, not just for conservatives, not just for Bernie Sanders [supporters] but for everybody. ” Such a resolution would protect not just organisations, but also for “that student who writes and argues a conservative point in their essay and gets an F on it. ” The full interview with Ariana will be out on Friday.

Woman Gives FBI Novel Excuse for Child Porn on Her Cell Phone,"A woman arrested for having child porn on her cell phone gave the FBI a unique excuse for collecting the images. It was, she allegedly said, a “coping mechanism. ”[Imperial, Pennsylvania, resident Kaitlin Plascjak, 28, was arrested after the FBI received a tip about what they might find on her phone and home computers, according to PennLive. com.  But upon her arrest, Plascjak had a ready excuse for officials. She reportedly said she began to view and collect child porn in 2006 as a way to cope because she was molested as a child. According to a police report, Plascjak said that she “has no children and viewing child pornography is a coping mechanism for her because she was molested when she was younger. ” The criminal complaint says that chat application Skype reported that child porn images were transmitted to a device linked to an IP address at the home in which Plascjak was living. An investigation revealed several other instances, as well. Authorities found up to 100 images of children exposing themselves and engaging in sexual conduct. Some of the images even depicted infants being sexually molested. A spokesman for the Allegheny County District Attorney’s Office noted Plascjak is the first woman arrested on child pornography charges in the 16 years the office has been working with the FBI Crimes Against Children and Cyber Crimes task forces.

It Turns Out Spending More Probably Does Improve Education - The New York Times,"If you spend more on education, will students do better? Educators, politicians and unions have battled in court over that crucial question for decades, most recently in a sweeping decision this fall in Connecticut, where a judge ordered the state to revamp nearly every facet of its education policies, from graduation requirements to special education, along with its school funding. For many years, research on the relationship between spending and student learning has been surprisingly inconclusive. Many other factors, including student poverty, parental education and the way schools are organized, contribute to educational results. Teasing out the specific effect of money spent is methodologically difficult. Opponents of increased school funding have seized on that ambiguity to argue that, for schools, money doesn’t matter  —   and, therefore, more money isn’t needed. But new,     research suggests that conclusion is mistaken. Money really does matter in education, which could provide fresh momentum for more lawsuits and judgments like the Connecticut decision. The study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in July, was conducted by the economists Julien Lafortune and Jesse Rothstein of the University of California at Berkeley and Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach of Northwestern. They examined student test scores in 26 states that have changed the way they fund schools since 1990, usually in response to a lawsuit like Connecticut’s, and compared them with those in 23 states that haven’t. While no two states did exactly the same thing, they all had the effect of increasing funding for the poorest districts. The   time frame is important: That’s when courts changed how they think about states’ obligations to public schoolchildren. Previously, nearly all school funding lawsuits focused on the question of “equity”  —   did disadvantaged students receive funding equal to that of their   peers? The problem with that perspective was the answer could be “yes,” even if funding was too low across the board. Starting with a 1990 court case in Kentucky, courts started asking about “adequacy” instead. Were school districts getting enough money, which might require giving extra money to districts that enroll many      students? “There’s been this wave of school finance reform across the country over the last few decades,” Mr. Rothstein said. “I think it’s fair to say it’s the largest reform aimed at equity since school desegregation, and we really didn’t know what the impacts were. There’s now growing evidence, from my work and from others, that those reforms did lead to improved achievement and improved outcomes for children in   school districts. ” Mr. Lafortune, Mr. Rothstein and Ms. Schanzenbach also solved a difficult methodological problem that had plagued school finance researchers for decades. More money isn’t an end unto itself  —   the goal is to produce better results. But before the recent widespread adoption of the Common Core State Standards, every state had its own standards and related tests. That made it hard to compare academic results from one state to another. The researchers took advantage of the one test that is taken by a representative sample of schoolchildren nationwide: the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, which is administered by the Department of Education. Although NAEP results are usually published only for whole states and a small number of large urban school districts, the researchers got the education department to let them analyze individual student scores. Those results include information on the  ’s race and income, as well as school district attended. The researchers could compare performance in poor and wealthy districts before and after changes in spending. They found a consistent pattern: In the long run, over comparable time frames, states that send additional money to their   school districts see more academic improvement in those districts than states that don’t. The size of the effect was significant. The changes bought at least twice as much achievement per dollar as a   experiment that decreased class sizes in the early grades. Another paper, published this year in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, looked at the same question through a different lens. That study examined   outcomes, like how long students stayed in school and how much they earned as adults, for students in districts with and without   funding changes. Here, too, researchers saw gains with more money spent. That study was conducted by C. Kirabo Jackson of Northwestern, Rucker C. Johnson from the University of California at Berkeley and Claudia Persico, then a graduate student at Northwestern and now an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin. They examined outcomes for about 15, 000 people, born between 1955 and 1985, and found that for poor children, a 10 percent increase in   spending each year of elementary and secondary school was associated with wages that were nearly 10 percent higher, a drop in the incidence of adult poverty and roughly six additional months of schooling. “The notion that spending doesn’t matter is just not true,” Mr. Jackson said. “We found that exposure to higher levels of public   spending when you’re in school has a pretty large beneficial effect on the adult outcomes of kids, and that those effects are much more pronounced for children from   families. ” Donald J. Trump’s recent nomination of Betsy DeVos, a wealthy Republican   and longtime supporter of private school vouchers, to be secretary of education probably won’t help the cause of those who want to use this research to spend more in   public school districts. But because 92 percent of all   funding comes from state and local sources, the decision won’t be up to her. It will lie with state lawmakers who now have a better reason to invest more in school districts educating children who have the least money. What the studies do not offer, notes Jennifer Alexander, chief executive of the Connecticut Coalition for Achievement Now, a group that backs charter schools and other overhauls, is robust information on the best use of the money. “How money is spent is equally important,” she said, “and I don’t think we have enough information about that from these studies. ” Mr. Rothstein cautioned that the idea that states could erase the achievement gap between poor and middle class students by simply cutting a few checks was unrealistic. “There has been a tendency to expect magic from these reforms,” he said. But a change does not have to solve a problem completely, he said, to be valuable. “We should consider them successful if they contribute in a meaningful way to closing the gap,” Mr. Rothstein said. “We have to make some assessment as to whether it’s enough to matter, but enough to matter can be quite a bit less than totally eliminating it. ”"
Clinton’s lead over Trump grows in new national polls," (CNN) Hillary Clinton has widened her lead over Donald Trump in a pair of new national polls published on Thursday, as the Republican nominee ends one of the worst weeks of his campaign. Clinton opened up a   margin in the   survey, 48% to 33% which was conducted as Trump feuded publicly first with the Muslim parents of a slain American war hero and then House Speaker Paul Ryan, one of the GOP’s most popular and powerful figures. Last month, Clinton held a narrow   advantage, 42% % in a   poll.  In an NBC   Street Journal poll, Clinton’s edge is 9 points (47% to 38%) cushioning what was a   advantage in early July. A   poll this week showed Clinton with a similar   edge over Trump nationally. RELATED: Clinton ahead in key battleground states  The added option of   candidates Jill Stein and Gary Johnson had little effect on the    spreads. In the   poll, Clinton’s lead shrunk by only 1 point, while she retained an identical   lead in the   survey. The results mark the latest in a string of national and battleground state polls showing Clinton with a growing base of support and, on Thursday, hints that she could be making inroads with male voters.  Clinton nearly tied Trump among men in the   poll and enjoys a   swing    she now leads by 8 points    in the   survey. With women, she continues to enjoy an overwhelming advantage    50% to 30% according to   and 51% to 35% in the   results.  Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, a longtime Trump ally, told CNN Thursday night he didn’t believe the flagging numbers were permanent, attributing them to a   National Convention bounce and ”some events” that have occurred in the past week. Trump has recently feuded with the Muslim family of a slain US soldier and infuriated the Republican establishment by not endorsing House Speaker Paul Ryan. ”Donald Trump is a campaigner and a warrior,” Sessions told CNN’s Erin Burnett on ”OutFront.” ”The numbers had him up not long ago. He’s down some now and I think you’ll see a rebound, no doubt about it, heading into November.” The   poll of 800 registered voters had a margin of error of 3. 5%. It was conducted from July 31 to August 3. The   survey reached 983 registered voters between August   and was statistically significant within 3. 1%. Correction: An earlier version of this story misidentified Alabama Sen. Jeff Session’s state. "
Obama’s SOTU: The Transformative President Triumphant - Breitbart,"Last night featured a terrific national championship college football game, but tonight, it will be President Obama spiking the football. Obama’s State of the Union address tonight will be a triumphalist reading of his massive accomplishments. [The New York Times’ resident   David Brooks says today that “Obama has championed a liberal agenda, but he hasn’t made the country unrecognizable,” but he isn’t right  —   Obama has indeed succeeded in transforming the country, and he’ll pat himself on the back with both hands, presumably until he begins crying from a case of broken ribs.  Here are 12 ways Obama has transformed America and the world: Executive Amnesty. It’s not just that President Obama has effectively legalized millions of illegal immigrants. It’s that he’s prevented deportations and gotten Republicans to pay for it. Obama has accomplished the signal achievement of forcing Republicans to break a key promise to their own base on executive amnesty  —   they ran on the basis of stopping Obama’s program in 2014, but now have funded it twice. Rage at that surrender has driven Donald Trump to the top of the polls, but Obama’s betting that no president will undo what he has done. Given the establishment’s support for Senator Marco Rubio ( ) and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, that’s not a terrible bet. Executive Gun Control. Obama’s crying jag at last week over gun control hid the fact that he’s setting the groundwork for his Department of Justice to target individual gunowners. Last week, Obama chief advisor Valerie Jarrett said that the ATF would prosecute people who sold guns as a dealer  —   but then defined dealer down to include even a single weapon, explaining, “The ATF and DOJ did not identify a magic number of weapons that makes you engaged in the business because that would limit their ability to bring prosecution. ” Attorney General Loretta Lynch stated, “It can be as few as one or two depending upon the circumstances under which the person sells the gun. ” The only way to set up such a regime would be to create a national gun registry. Obamacare. Republicans have pledged since 2010 to stop Obamacare. Aside from Senator Ted Cruz’s ( )   attempt to defund the program, Republicans have instead done nothing. Meanwhile, President Obama brags about skyrocketing enrollment as he forces the government gun to the head of consumers. He ignores the fact that he’s forcing religious institutions to cover contraception he ignores a boost in premiums. He ignores the fact that a huge chunk of new subscribers are coming in via Medicaid, which means they aren’t paying at all for their healthcare. Nonetheless, Republicans continue to fund the program. Planned Parenthood. Obama hasn’t just enshrined Planned Parenthood’s abortion business  —   he’s done it while defanging the single largest scandal ever to engulf the abortion mill. After news broke that Planned Parenthood was dissecting dead babies and selling their body parts for research, the Obama administration stood firm against defunding efforts  —   and when Republicans refused to attach the defunding issue to a broader budget, Obama simply vetoed the   bill. Republicans went ahead and funded Planned Parenthood in the end. As always. The Iran Deal. President Obama’s Iran deal hands the mullahs nuclear weapons in a decade, and hands them massive financial power, which will be channeled into terrorism and territorial expansionism, immediately. Incredibly, the Republicans signed off on this one too by greenlighting the asinine Corker proposal, which allowed Obama to get away with his perverse deal with far more than half the Senate and House objecting. Instead of holding Obama accountable under the Constitution by insisting that the Iran deal was a treaty, they ended up protesting loudly as Obama simply did what he wanted. The result: Iranian expansion throughout the region, more moderate regimes in danger, ISIS on the rise, and the possibility of a nuclear arms race. Slashing The Military. Republicans, in attempting to stop Obama’s spending spree, jumped on board with the foolhardy sequestration deal that would supposedly slash future spending  —   but in actuality served mainly to stop spending on the military. Obama insisted that half of all cuts come from our military. The result is a military that has been dramatically weakened. On top of that, Obama has insisted on using the military as a vehicle for his social experimentation on behalf of women and transgenders. Destruction Of America’s Traditional Alliances. Israel used to be our strongest ally in the Middle East. Other allies included Egypt and Saudi Arabia and Jordan. All are now looking elsewhere as Obama forges alliances with the Muslim Brotherhood on one hand and the Iranians on the other. Despite Congress’s best attempts to reach out to Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Obama has succeeded in crafting a regime of international isolation for the Jewish State, even as he boosts the terrorist Palestinians. The new Egyptian government has already begun looking for allies in Russia and China, and Saudi Arabia is making clear its displeasure with the Obama administration. The Dependency Society. Obama has spent $8 trillion in order to craft a permanent dependency society in which almost four in ten Americans of working age don’t work, in which millions of   students will enmesh themselves in debt before working for the government, in which 46 million Americans are on food stamps and eight million are on disability. Those numbers will continue to grow  —   and Democrats will never allow a revamp of Social Security or Medicare, either. The Enshrinement of   Marriage. President Obama says that the most important moment of his presidency was the Supreme Court mandating     marriage. He even used the White House as a canvas for his polarizing social politics, shining a rainbow flag on the People’s House. Obama’s destruction of traditional marriage in the legal sphere means that First Amendment religious freedoms are now under permanent assault, as religious businessowners face the backlash of a mobilized left. They will be forced to shell out hundreds of thousands of dollars simply to avoid participating in sin  —   and if they do it repeatedly, they’ll be forced out of business altogether. Mobilization of The Bureaucracy Against Political Opponents. The IRS has targeted Obama’s political opposition. Obama stacked the National Labor Relations Board in order to target businesses that did not comply with the demands of his union cronies. Obama has used the DOJ to target his political opponents, too, and to avoid prosecuting his political allies like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The Bureau of Land Management continues to expand its grasp upon state lands, and in doing so, target those whose land it wishes to grab. Every area of the Obama bureaucracy has become politicized. And they all have SWAT teams. Racial Breakdown. Obama’s DOJ is targeting police departments around America Obama himself continues to press the message that America is deeply racist, and that such racism is embedded into our DNA. Because he is the first black president, that critique bites all the more, and it has caused more racial polarization than at any time since the Los Angeles riots. Riots have broken out in major cities murder rates are up, too. Policing is down. None of this will be easy to reverse  —   yet another generation of minorities in America have now been trained that “white privilege” is to blame for any problems they suffer. Stacking The Supreme Court. Obama has put in place two new Supreme Court justices: Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. Both are relatively young, and both are wildly leftist. Obama is one justice away from complete dominance on the Court  —   all he needs is Anthony Kennedy to resign, and the Constitution turns to ash. That is your actual State of the Union under President Obama. Most galling, he’ll cheer himself to the skies tonight for it.

An Alt-Right Makeover Shrouds the Swastikas - The New York Times,"A small but determined political organization in Detroit began to worry that its official symbol was a bit  . With the group’s central philosophy suddenly finding traction in the daily discourse, appearances mattered. So in November, as the country’s divisive presidential campaign became ever more jagged, the National Socialist Movement, a leading   group, did away with its swastika. In its stead, the group chose a symbol from a   alphabet that was also adopted by the Nazis. According to Jeff Schoep, the movement’s leader, the decision to dispense with the swastika was “an attempt to become more integrated and more mainstream. ” Let us pause. Not even two years ago, white supremacists like Mr. Schoep would rant from the fringe of the fringe, their   events rarely worth mention. Today, though, the Schoeps of America are undergoing a rebranding, as part of the    : a grab bag of   groups generally united by the belief that white identity has become endangered in what they deride as this era of dangerous diversity and political correctness. The deceptively benign phrase “ ” now peppers the national conversation, often in ways that play down its fundamental beliefs, which have long been considered intolerant and hateful. The term’s recent prevalence corresponds with the rise of   Donald J. Trump   leaders say his inflammatory statements and Twitter habits in the campaign energized, even validated, their movement. The movement is also acutely   seeing the burning crosses, swastikas and language of yesteryear as impediments to recruitment. Its adherents talk of “getting ” a reference to the movie “The Matrix,” in which the protagonist ingests a tablet that melts away artifice to reveal the truth. New, coded slurs have emerged. Fewer pointed hoods, more khaki pants. But the   movement is hardly monolithic, despite a   gathering last month in Washington  —   one that might have been mistaken for just another corporate conference were it not for the   sentiments and the Nazi salutes. The factions within its ranks can differ on any number of subjects: white supremacy versus white nationalism, for example, or the vexing “J. Q. ”  —   the “Jewish Question. ” James Edwards, a   talk radio host who describes himself as a “  advocate”  —   and who interviewed the  ’s son Donald Trump Jr. this year  —   wrote in an email that the   movement was “a group of marauding conservatives who reject both the failures of establishment conservatism and the false gods of political correctness. ” Race is the uniting factor, Mr. Edwards wrote. “One fundamental element of the   that brings the disparate factions together is the awareness of the reality of race and the need for European Americans to have organizations and spokespeople that explicitly advocate for our unique group interests. ” For many years, the    gaggle now called the   existed in the shadowed alleys of American culture, sharing views through newsletters, online radio and crude websites. The news media often debated whether to cover their sparsely attended rallies, considering that any attention might grant the groups a veneer of legitimacy. Andrew Anglin, the founder of the     website The Daily Stormer, described the current moment in a recent essay as “a reboot of the White Nationalist movement”  —   one infused with youthful energy. The foot soldiers of the movement are not old white supremacists marching under a new banner, Mr. Anglin explained, but a mostly younger generation drawn from various online cultures, including conspiracy theorists and that misogynistic stratum of the internet known as the “manosphere. ” Then came Mr. Trump, whose opening gambit as a presidential candidate included his promise to build a wall to keep out Mexican immigrants, whom he called rapists and criminals. The   raised its collective head to listen. “I’d been waiting to hear those words from a mainstream political candidate all my life,” said Gerald Martin, a retired   teacher from Dallas who grew up in a family that opposed desegregation. He is a veteran of both the Army and a number of white supremacist movements, and   the likes of William Luther Pierce III, a white supremacist who wrote “The Turner Diaries,” a novel about an underground band of white Americans who fight a   government controlled by Jews. Before the Trump candidacy, Mr. Martin said, few in the   were talking about politics the movement was more about winning the battle of ideas. But once Mr. Trump began to talk, he said, “suddenly we’re all talking politics and we’re politically energized. ” “We’re almost intoxicated,” Mr. Martin continued. “We don’t have any power  —   but now we’re close enough to smell it. ” Perhaps in another age, any candidate’s engagement with white supremacists and separatists would have resulted in an awkward news conference announcing the end of his campaign. But this is a new age, in which Mr. Trump went unscathed for engaging with Twitter users like WhiteGenocideTM, who listed his location as “Jewmerica” and used an image of the founder of the American Nazi Party as his Twitter profile’s photograph. Mr. Trump brushed off his sharing of   messages on social media as inconsequential  —   the sort of thing that just happens on Twitter. He also denied at one point the existence of any   movement. “Nobody even knows what it is,” he told CNN in August. “This is a term that was just given that  —   frankly, there’s no   or  . ” As if to clarify matters, members of the   movement gathered in Washington about two weeks after Mr. Trump’s election for a conference sponsored by the National Policy Institute, an organization that describes itself as being “dedicated to the heritage, identity and future of people of European descent. ” Its president, Richard B. Spencer, 38, is a prominent   leader who wears his brown hair in an undercut style once popular among the Hitler Youth. It’s called a “fashy,” as in fascist. Mr. Spencer said in an interview that as he saw it, the principles of American conservatism throughout most of the 20th century had been wrongly defined within the context of capitalism and its ideological battle with communism. The matter of European identity, he said, was assumed, but never stated outright. “Race is real,” he said. “Race matters. Race is the foundation of identity. ” Not everyone in the movement appreciated the moment at the end of the conference when some in the audience raised stiffened arms, echoing the Nazi salute. Discussions afterward reflected the divisions in the loosely aligned ranks, as well as an acute awareness of public perception and the need to make their messages somehow more palatable. Paul Ramsey, a blogger and retired computer programmer in Oklahoma, generally follows an   ideology, though he said he did not believe in a white  . He said he had long feared a hijacking of the movement by the “  . K. K. element,” which would lead to vilification and a relegation back to the fringe. Those salutes confirmed his fears, Mr. Ramsey said, and he is now disassociating from the   movement, even though he understands that Mr. Spencer may believe in a       philosophy. “The new Nazism is very demonized and toxic, and associating your brand with that is crazy,” he said. Mr. Martin, the retired teacher, who attended the conference, also didn’t care for the   salutes, calling them “very foolish. ” But he suggested that most of those raising their arms were using the salute as “their version of the middle finger”  —   a defiant gesture “to the media, to the Trump haters, to everybody they feel alienated from. ” Indeed, the movement has the feel of a dispossessed youth rising up. Hours of interviews with young   leaders suggest a pattern toward their   radicalization. Seeing domestic and global strife often rooted in racial and ethnic differences. Finding validation from   people on the internet. Hearing a major presidential candidate echo their grievances. “The political establishment has made an entire generation of young white men and women into fascists, and that’s a beautiful thing!” said Matthew Heimbach, 25, who runs the Traditionalist Worker Party out of his trailer in Indiana. His group advocates replacing the United States with   based on races, ethnicities and religions. In Northern California, a university student, felon and Marine veteran, Nathan Damigo, oversees a group called Identity Evropa, which he described as a “fraternity” of mostly young,   men who celebrate European heritage  —   that is, an embrace of white identity and a rejection of multicultural coexistence. Ever conscious of the importance of marketing, Mr. Damigo, 30, pointed out that Identity Evropa’s website “looks completely mainstreamed. ” And it does, featuring men in business suits who also happen to be sporting the Hitler   haircut. But for all the fresh approaches  —   the slick marketing, the internet savviness  —   the message remains the same. It is one of separation, of supremacy, of a refusal to recognize the equal worth of others who do not have the same skin tone or share the same religion. The ascension of the   has lifted some familiar names from the muck of the past, including David Duke, the white nationalist, Holocaust denier and former Louisiana state representative whose national profile has been resurrected. When a reporter telephoned him recently to discuss the   movement, Mr. Duke wasted little time with a question of his own: “Are you Jewish?”"
Germany Bans ‘True Religion’ Muslim Group and Raids Mosques - The New York Times,"BERLIN  —   A German organization that calls itself the True Religion and that is known for distributing   copies of the Quran was outlawed on Tuesday, after the authorities accused it of recruiting jihadists to fight in Iraq and Syria. Thomas de Maizière, the German interior minister, said the government had banned the True Religion organization, which is also known as Read (as in the instruction to read the Quran) because it acted as a “collecting pool” for   Islamist fighters. Starting on Tuesday morning, officers raided 190 premises in more than half of Germany’s 16 states. Materials were secured, but there were no detentions, Mr. de Maizière said. “The organization brings Islamic jihadists together under the pretext of the harmless distribution of the Quran,” Mr. de Maizière told reporters in Berlin, stressing that the authorities were acting against the group because of its work to foster violence, not because of its faith. “A systematic curtailment of our rule of law has nothing to do with the alleged freedom of religion,” he said. The move comes after months of surveillance of the organization, whose   members have become a common sight in pedestrian shopping areas in major German cities. Mr. de Maizière said that 140 of the group’s supporters are known to have traveled to Syria or Iraq to fight on behalf of the Islamic State. “The translations of the Quran are being distributed along with messages of hatred and unconstitutional ideologies,” Mr. de Maizière said. “Teenagers are being radicalized with conspiracy theories. ” The move comes a week after the authorities arrested five men who were accused of aiding the Islamic State in Germany by recruiting members and providing financial and logistical help. The True Religion is the sixth Islamist organization to be banned in Germany since 2012, under an effort to ensure domestic security and to prevent radicalized young people from leaving the country to fight for extremists abroad. Germany has been gripped by a wave of   terrorist attacks this year, including three that were claimed by the Islamic State: the knifing of a policeman in February, an ax attack by a young refugee, and a suicide bombing, both in July. (The only deaths in those assaults were those of the attackers.) Most of the nearly one million migrants and refugees who arrived in Germany last year were Muslims. Security officials have been concerned that those who become frustrated or disillusioned at the difficulty of starting a new life in Europe could provide fertile ground for radical Islamists seeking to recruit members. The campaign to hand out the Qurans to   was the idea of Ibrahim   a Palestinian who preaches a conservative brand of Islam known as Salafism. German security officials said he was not in Germany at the time of the raids. Mr. de Maizière declined to comment on Mr.  ’s possible whereabouts. Mr.   who has lived in Germany for more than 30 years, has been on the radar of German security officials since 2005, when he set up a website that officials say spreads extremist propaganda. An attempt to prosecute Mr.   in 2012 on charges of incitement of religious hatred failed. Even as they are carrying out a sweeping effort to prevent radical Muslims from committing terrorist acts, the German authorities are also working to stop violence by   extremists. There was a 42 percent increase in the number of violent acts committed by the far right in 2015, according to the country’s domestic intelligence service, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution. On Tuesday, federal prosecutors said they had charged eight men from the eastern state of Saxony with forming a   terrorist organization known as the Freital Group, after the city near Dresden where many of the group’s attacks were carried out. The charges were brought by the state court in Dresden last Wednesday, the prosecutors said. “The aim of the organization was to carry out explosive attacks on shelters for asylum seekers, as well as homes, offices and automobiles of political dissidents,” the prosecutors said in a statement. “Through these actions, the suspects wanted to create an atmosphere of fear and repression. ” Others from the group are already facing charges, including attempted murder, carrying out an explosion and vandalism, over a series of attacks that began in late July 2015 and continued through November of that year. Those assaults involved lobbing explosives at the offices of the Left Party and at a refugee shelter in Freital."
Connecticut to Appeal Decision in Schools Funding Case - The New York Times,"The State of Connecticut said on Thursday that it would appeal a sweeping ruling in a schools funding case that ordered it to   virtually the entire education system. “There are strong arguments that the trial court exceeded its authority and the standards articulated by the Connecticut Supreme Court, and so today we are asking that court to review this ruling,” Attorney General George C. Jepsen said in a statement. In the   case, Judge Thomas G. Moukawsher of State Superior Court in Hartford found last week that Connecticut was “defaulting on its constitutional duty” to give all children an adequate education because the state was allowing students in poor districts to languish while those in wealthy districts excelled. Judge Moukawsher gave the state 180 days to revamp teacher evaluations and compensation, school funding policies, special education services and graduation requirements. The ruling was met with enthusiasm by elected officials in some of the state’s poorer cities, but others, including the state’s teachers’ union, objected. Sheila Cohen, the president of the union, the Connecticut Education Association, in a statement on Thursday called Judge Moukawsher’s decision “broad and overreaching. ” Advocates for people with disabilities were also troubled by aspects of the ruling, which suggested that some students might be too disabled for educational services, while also calling for more equitable access to services. Nancy B. Alisberg, managing attorney at Connecticut’s Office of Protection and Advocacy for Persons With Disabilities, part of a national network of civil rights organizations, said she worried that “schools could say, ‘Oh no, this child is too disabled, they won’t benefit from an education, so we don’t have to provide them with anything.’ It is, frankly, terrifying. ” Ms. Alisberg added, “I think it boils down to a belief on the part of the court that there are certain students who, based on the level of their disability, don’t deserve an education. ” The state said in its appeal that Judge Moukawsher demanded changes to educational policies that could be enacted only by the Connecticut General Assembly. “This decision would wrest educational policy from the representative branches of state government, limit public education for some students with special needs, create additional municipal mandates concerning graduation and other standards and alter the basic terms of educators’ employment  —   and entrust all of those matters to the discretion of a single, unelected judge,” Mr. Jepsen, a Democrat, wrote in his statement. There have been dozens of school funding lawsuits across the country. But this one, known as Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education Funding v. Rell, was set apart by the extent of the changes the judge required, which went far beyond dollars. The coalition said it was weighing its options. Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, has stood on both sides of the case. When the lawsuit was filed in 2005, Mr. Malloy, then the mayor of Stamford, spoke out in support. Years later, he appointed Judge Moukawsher to his current seat on the bench. Now the state is resisting the judge’s decision. Mr. Malloy said in a statement that he accepted the attorney general’s decision to appeal and hoped systemic education problems could be addressed in the coming session of the General Assembly, calling a legislative approach “always preferable to a judicial decision. ” “We hope that this moment marks the start, rather than the stalling, of a statewide dialogue around finding a better way to fund our schools, which ultimately results in a better solution for our students and communities,” the governor said. “We should act together, and we should do it sooner rather than later. ”"
Top Cardinal: Islam Wants To Dominate The World,"A senior cardinal has said there is “no question that Islam wants to govern the world” and the only way to save Western civilisation is to return it to its Christian roots. [Cardinal Raymond Burke said that while Muslims were “lovely people” their religion teaches that it should dominate the state, and any country with a Muslim majority must submit to Islamic law.  Speaking to Religion News Service, the American cardinal criticised Christian leaders who “simply think that Islam is a religion like the Catholic faith or the Jewish faith. ” “That simply is not objectively the case,” he claimed. “When they become a majority in any country then they have the religious obligation to govern that country,” the cardinal added. “If that’s what the citizens of a nation want, well, then, they should just allow this to go on. But if that’s not what they want, then they have to find a way to deal with it. ” He also said that areas of France and Belgium have become “  zones” that are effectively “little Muslim states”. When asked how the West should respond to increasing Islamisation, Cardinal Burke said: “I think the appropriate response is to be firm about the Christian origin of our own nation, and certainly in Europe, and the Christian foundations of the government, and to fortify those. ” “We have to say no, our country is not free to become a Muslim state,” he added. The cardinal was speaking ahead of the publication of his book Hope For The World: To Unite All Things In Christ, which takes the form of an extended interview. The Catholic Herald quotes the cardinal as saying in the book: “Islam is a religion that, according to its own interpretation, must also become the State. The Koran, and the authentic interpretations of it given by various experts in Koranic law, is destined to govern the world. “In reality, there is no place for other religions, even though they may be tolerated, as long as Islam has not succeeded in establishing its sovereignty over the nations and over the world. ” Cardinal Raymond Burke is patron of the Sovereign Order of Malta and is seen as one of the leading figures among traditionalist Catholics. He has become known for his uncompromising conservative views and has a strong affinity for the traditional Latin Mass.  "
"Brooks: Trump ’Lashing Out’ in ’Extremely Disturbing’ Ways, Not ’Projecting Mental Stability’ - Breitbart","On Friday’s “PBS NewsHour,” New York Times columnist David Brooks argued that there is no “serious” evidence of collusion between the Trump camp and Russia, but the president is reacting in a disturbing manner.  Brooks stated, “[I]t may be a witchhunt, but he’s acting like a witch. You know, to me, we’ve had this  —   the idea that there’s been collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign has been investigated for a long time. And so far, we’ve had no really serious evidence that they did collude, and everything else seems to be leaking out. So, I begin to be a little suspicious —  and maybe I’m wrong —  we’ll see over the long term whether there was any actual act of collusion. There were certainly conversations maybe about some building and some investment, but so far, no evidence of an underlying crime. ” He continued, “But this, to me, is not a criminal story. It’s a psychological story. And it’s a story about a president who seems to feel under more pressure, under more threat, lashing out in ways that are painfully   but also extremely disturbing to anybody around him. And so, whether it’s the North Korean Cabinet hearing that he held recently, where they all had to praise him, or the tweets as late as this morning, this is not a president who’s projecting mental stability. And the idea that he’ll fire somebody, whether it’s Mueller or anybody else, seems very plausible. And so, to me, if there’s something really damaging here, it’s something that has not yet happened caused by the psychological pressure that he apparently feels. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"
’Veto Gunmageddon’ Launched to Repeal California Gun Controls,"A group of gun rights supporters began distributing petitions to guns stores and firing ranges. The group aims to collect enough signatures to secure a popular vote on gun controls recently passed by lawmakers and signed by Governor Jerry Brown (D). [The movement seeking the popular vote is called “Veto Gunmageddon. ”  On July 1, Brown signed six new gun controls into law. Among them were a statewide ban on the possession of “high capacity” magazines, an enhancement of the state’s “assault weapons” ban, and a measure requiring background checks for ammunition purchasers. Then, on July 24, Brown circled back and signed another gun control measure he passed over on July 1. The additional measure requires that anyone assembling a gun at home first apply for a serial number from the government. It is clearly a way to extend registration and the government’s knowledge of guns owned by   citizens. According to The Mercury News, Veto Gunmageddon believes the people will strike these laws down if given a chance, and they are using their petitions to secure that chance. Barry Bahrami is leading the Veto Gunmageddon movement. He said, “This is what the people’s veto is for. Anyone who knows anything about firearms looks at these laws and knows how ridiculous they are. ” Bahrami’s contention that the laws are ridiculous is substantiated by a cursory view of crime stats in cities that already have some of the requirements Brown signed into state law on July 1. For example, Los Angeles instituted a “high capacity” magazine ban last year, and during the first six months of this year, violent crime jumped 20 percent in the city. Moreover, approaching the argument from another angle, consider Elliot Rodger’s May 23, 2014, attack on Santa Barbara. As he drove around randomly shooting individuals, he only used   magazines —  the   “standard capacity” magazines now mandated for everyone. So the new ban on “high capacity” magazines is basically a ban on using any magazine larger than Elliot Rodger used to carry out his attack.

I ’went about it the wrong way’: Pizzeria gunman explains his motive,"’  ’ ’   In his first interview with the media since he fired an assault   rifle in a Washington pizzeria, Edgar M.

Ted Cruz going on Obamacare," (CNN) Ted Cruz is going on Obamacare. The newly announced Republican presidential candidate told CNN’s Dana Bash on Tuesday that he will sign up for health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act    a law he has been on a crusade to kill. ”We’ll be getting new health insurance and we’ll presumably do it through my job with the Senate, and so we’ll be on the federal exchange with millions of others on the federal exchange,” Cruz said.  Asked whether he would accept the government contribution available to lawmakers and congressional staffers for their health care coverage through the ACA, Cruz said he will ”follow the text of the law.” ”I strongly oppose the exemption that President Obama illegally put in place for members of Congress because (Senate Minority Leader) Harry Reid and the Senate Democrats didn’t want to be under the same rules as the American people,” Cruz said, before repeating: ”I believe we should follow the text of the law.” Under the Affordable Care Act, members of Congress and some designated congressional staffers are required to obtain health care coverage through the D. C. Health Link Small Business Market. The Office of Personnel Management’s guidelines state that lawmakers and their staff receive a ”government contribution” if they get health care coverage through the ACA.  But some lawmakers have declined to accept the contribution, saying they do not want to get special treatment. After the interview, a Cruz spokesperson clarified that he wouldn’t take the contribution. Cruz’s admission comes one day after CNN first reported that the senator would no longer have access to health benefits through his wife’s employer, Goldman Sachs. Heidi Cruz, a managing director at the firm’s Houston office, has gone on unpaid leave for the duration of the senator’s presidential campaign and will not have access to the company’s benefits during that time.  Cruz’s campaign appeared caught by surprise Monday by questions about the senator’s health care. Asked how Cruz’s family would be covered after his wife lost her Goldman Sachs benefits, Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler repeatedly answered that he didn’t know. It’s a deeply ironic development for the Texas conservative firebrand, who vaulted to fame during his few years in the Senate in large part by denouncing President Barack Obama’s landmark health care law. He led an effort to defund the law that contributed to the 2013 government shutdown. Cruz denied that there was anything ironic about him going on Obamacare, saying he was simply following the law. ”I believe we should follow the text of every law, even laws I disagree with,” Cruz told CNN. ”It’s one of the real differences    if you look at President Obama and the lawlessness, if he disagrees with a law he simply refuses to follow it or claims the authority to unilaterally change.” After the publication of this story, Cruz advisers said there was nothing unusual about the senator signing up for insurance coverage through his employer. They argued that Obamacare has wiped out the individual market, leaving Cruz with few options.  Cruz said he will continue advocating for repealing the law. ”What is problematic about Obamacare is that it is killing millions of jobs in this country and has killed millions of jobs,” Cruz said. ”It has forced millions of people into part time work. It has caused millions of people to lose their insurance, to lose their doctors and to face skyrocketing insurance premiums. That is unacceptable.”"
"After Mother Teresa Canonization, Pope Francis Throws Pizza Party","After officiating the canonization Mass for Mother Teresa of Calcutta on Sunday, Pope Francis played host to 1, 500 poor people from a number of Italian cities, throwing them a pizza party in the Vatican. [The Vatican brought in a team of some 20 pizza bakers, complete with three mobile ovens, to churn out   Neapolitan pizzas for the guests in the spirit of the Albanian nun who devoted her life to serving the “poorest of the poor. ”  The canonization Mass, which saw Mother Teresa honored officially as a Catholic saint, took place in a sunny Saint Peter’s Square Sunday before a crowd of more than 100, 000 people from around the world. The Pope had reserved one of the areas closest to the altar for 1, 500 homeless people from around the country to be able to take part in the ceremony. The guests came from shelters run by the Missionaries of Charity, the religious order founded by Mother Teresa, in the cities of Milan, Bologna, Florence and Naples. “They traveled all night by bus to participate first in the canonization and then in the lunch,” said Archbishop Konrad Krajewski, the Pope’s almoner. In his homily at Mass, the Pope called Mother Teresa an “emblematic figure of womanhood and of consecrated life” and held her up as a “model of holiness” for today’s generation. In all aspects of her life, Francis said, Teresa was “a generous dispenser of divine mercy, making herself available for everyone through her welcome and defence of human life, those unborn and those abandoned and discarded. ” Sunday’s   lunch took place in the ample Paul VI hall, which serves as a center for meetings and large gatherings in the Vatican City. The pizzas were served by 250 of Mother Teresa’s sisters along with some 50 brothers of the male branch of the Missionaries, and other volunteers who offered their services for the occasion.

Federal Transgender Bathroom Access Guidelines Blocked by Judge - The New York Times,"A federal judge has blocked the Obama administration from enforcing new guidelines that were intended to expand restroom access for transgender students across the country. Judge Reed O’Connor of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Texas said in a   ruling, which he said should apply nationwide, that the government had not complied with federal law when it issued “directives which contradict the existing legislative and regulatory text. ” Judge O’Connor, whom President George W. Bush nominated to the federal bench, said that not granting an injunction would put states “in the position of either maintaining their current policies in the face of the federal government’s view that they are violating the law, or changing them to comply with the guidelines and cede their authority over this issue. ” The judge’s order on Sunday, in a case brought by officials from more than a dozen states, was a victory for social conservatives in the continuing legal battles over the restroom guidelines, which the federal government issued this year. The culture war over the rights of transgender people, and especially their right to use public bathrooms consistent with their gender identities, has emerged as an emotional cause among social conservatives. The Obama administration’s assertion that the rights of transgender people in public schools and workplaces are protected under existing laws against sex discrimination has been condemned by social conservatives, who said the administration was illegally intruding into local affairs and promoting a policy that would jeopardize the privacy and safety of schoolchildren. The ruling could deter the administration from bringing new legal action against school districts that do not allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms of their choice. “We are pleased that the court ruled against the Obama administration’s latest illegal federal overreach,” Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas said in a statement on Monday. “This president is attempting to rewrite the laws enacted by the elected representatives of the people and is threatening to take away federal funding from schools to force them to conform. ” A spokeswoman for the Justice Department, Dena W. Iverson, said the department was disappointed with the decision and was reviewing its options. In a statement, several civil rights organizations that had submitted a brief opposing the injunction called the ruling unfortunate and premature. “A ruling by a single judge in one circuit cannot and does not undo the years of clear legal precedent nationwide establishing that transgender students have the right to go to school without being singled out for discrimination,” the groups  —   Lambda Legal the American Civil Liberties Union and the A. C. L. U. of Texas the National Center for Lesbian Rights the Transgender Law Center and G. L. B. T. Q. Legal Advocates  Defenders  —   said in their statement. The ultimate impact of the Texas decision is unclear and is likely to be limited, legal experts said. For one thing, more senior courts in other regions have agreed with the administration that transgender students and workers are protected by existing laws against sex discrimination, and their decisions will not be altered by the Texas ruling. Also, the decision will not necessarily affect the outcome of other current cases. In the most prominent one, a federal court in North Carolina is weighing almost identical issues in suits brought by civil rights groups and the Justice Department that seek to block a state law requiring people in government buildings, including public schools, to use bathrooms that correspond to the gender on their birth certificates. Adding another major note of uncertainty, the United States Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a decision by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals that required a school district in Virginia to allow a transgender boy to use the boys’ bathrooms. The Supreme Court issued a temporary injunction until it decides, probably this fall, whether to hear the case. If the Supreme Court does take the case and reaches a majority decision one way or another, then existing rulings by district and appeals courts could be superseded. If the Supreme Court takes the Virginia case but then is divided, four to four, on the issues, the Fourth Circuit’s existing decision in favor of transgender rights would take effect, although it would not be a nationally binding precedent. The Texas lawsuit, filed by Mr. Paxton on behalf of officials in 13 states, argued that the Obama administration had overstepped its authority in a series of pronouncements in recent years holding that discrimination against transgender people is a violation of existing laws against sex discrimination, including Title IX in federal education laws and Title VII in federal civil rights laws governing the workplace. In May, in the latest such statement, the federal Justice and Education Departments issued a letter to public schools stating that transgender people should be free to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identities, and that schools that refused could lose federal funds. “A school may not require transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity or to use   facilities when other students are not required to do so,” the letter stated. The letter was quickly condemned by social conservatives, leading numerous state governments and school districts around the country to file lawsuits seeking to prevent the administration from taking action. The Obama administration, seeking to deflect the Texas lawsuit and another brought by 10 other states, argued that the directive was not a regulation or mandate but rather an explanation of how the administration interpreted existing   protections. But it carried a threat that the administration might sue noncompliant school districts and seek to cut off vital federal education aid. The states argued not only that the administration was wrong as a matter of law, but also that it had failed to follow legal procedures for issuing what the states called a “new mandate” that “harms school districts from coast to coast by usurping lawful authority” and jeopardizing “billions of dollars in federal funding. ” The Justice Department countered that the case was not suitable for litigation because the states had not shown evidence that they faced imminent harm, let alone a likelihood of success on the merits. If the administration brought action against school districts, the government and groups supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights argued, the school districts or states could make their case in court. “There is a multistep procedure before a state might lose federal funding,” said Jon W. Davidson, the legal director of Lambda Legal. “The government would have to specifically challenge a state, the state could respond, the government could bring a lawsuit, and then litigation in the courts would decide whether the government’s interpretation of the law is correct or not. ”"

Loretta Lynch is having a surprisingly bad day in the Comey testimony,  —   Chris Cillizza (@CillizzaCNN) June 8, 2017,  If it wasn’t for Trump becoming president, the corruption with Obama’s Department of Justice would be a major story. https:  .   —   Josh Kraushaar (@HotlineJosh) June 8, 2017,  Comey also just testified that he did not believe that Lynch could “credibly deny” the Hillary Clinton email scandal investigation, and that she had a serious conflict of interest. He also testified in exchange with Sen. John Cornyn ( ) the Senate Majority Whip, that it is possible a special prosecutor was needed for the email scandal. He said he considered calling for appointing a special counsel in the scandal, but decided against it. UPDATE 12:08 P. M. Oh my.

M. There are now serious questions being raised as to whether Loretta Lynch, the former Attorney General from the Obama administration, will be subpoenaed to testify after this hearing where Comey has implicated her. Legit question: is Loretta Lynch going to be subpoenaed as a result of this testimony?  —   Mike Shields (@mshields007) June 8, 2017,  Meanwhile, Comey’s admission he is a leaker serious hurts him.

Leaking to a friend for disclosure can raise serious questions.  —   Jonathan Turley (@JonathanTurley) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 12:02 P. M. Donald Trump, Jr. highlights an excellent question from Sen. Roy Blunt ( ) to Comey. Comey did not have a great answer. Sen Blunt: If you told Sessions you didn’t want to be alone with Trump again, why did you continue to take his calls?  —   Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 12:01 P. M. From our RNC friends, here’s video of Sen. Rubio crushing another leftist media narrative during his questioning of Comey.  Basically, Comey was so concerned about President Trump’s conversations with him that he alerted exactly nobody who could do anything about it. In other words, this whole thing is a giant  . Except for Comey implicating himself as a leaker. UPDATE 11:58 A. M. Comey is in big trouble after this hearing. He admitted he’s a leaker, and has an actual network through which he leaks information to the press. In addition, he withheld from leaking information that would have vindicated President Trump weeks ago. White House social media director Dan Scavino captures it clearly and concisely on Twitter: Because if it was leaked that @realDonaldTrump was personally not under   it would have crushed the entire narrative. pic. twitter.   —   Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) June 8, 2017,  President Trump still has yet to Tweet, so no free drinks yet here at Union Pub. Looks like the owners here made a smart decision since this place is standing room only right now. UPDATE 11:54 A. M. Oh, man, this keeps getting better and better. Comey just shredded the Democrats AND now the fake news media. Oh Boy. Comey says there have been many many stories based on classified information about Russia that are just ”dead wrong”  —   Maeve Reston (@MaeveReston) June 8, 2017,  I wonder if any of the media outlets that have printed repeated stories on these matters will check their reporting again or correct it if they’re wrong. Not holding my breath. UPDATE 11:50 A. M. Comey has emerged throughout this hearing before the American people looking very much like a drama queen. One of the more memorable lines is when he says when Trump called him to ask him if he was free for dinner, he had to break a date with his wife. Comey says Trump called him at his desk. ”Free for dinner tonight? ””I said yessir  …    I had to call my wife and break a date with her.”  —   Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) June 8, 2017,  That’s not the only   Comey testimony: COMEY JUST QUOTES HENRY 11 on what he thought Trump meant: ’Will no one rid me of this toublesome priest”  —   Trip Gabriel (@tripgabriel) June 8, 2017,  Meanwhile, even CNN’s Jim Acosta —  a vehemently   media figure in the heart of the opposition party’s mothership CNN —  is joining in on the   fun.

Swamp Things are going to Swamp. UPDATE 11:45 A. M. Comey’s open admission he orchestrated a potentially illegal leak puts him in serious potential trouble, the New York Times people note.

While obstruction is now off the table for Trump, as Breitbart’s Joel Pollak detailed, Breitbart’s John Hayward notes that obstruction is back on the table for several leading officials from now former President Barack Obama’s administration. Hayward says Congress needs to investigate Loretta Lynch, the former Attorney General, as well as Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton —  the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee —  for obstruction of justice. Big takeaway from the Comey hearing: urgent need to investigate Loretta Lynch, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton for obstruction,  —   John Hayward (@Doc_0) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:29 A. M. Our very own Joel Pollak is out with another bombshell piece detailing how this hearing has shattered the media’s and the Democrats’ efforts to taint President Trump with “obstruction of justice. ” “Democrats have hinged their hopes for impeachment  —   and reversing the 2016 elections  —   on the idea that Trump committed obstruction of justice. That case has now been smashed beyond repair,” Pollak writes, pointing to a Comey exchange with Sen. Jim Risch ( ). Read his whole story here. UPDATE 11:26 A. M.

M. from this morning’s Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXMTom Fitton of Judicial Watch,  says there is no evidence of any wrongdoing by President Trump or his team. And he called the special counsel “wasteful. ” If Robert Mueller, the special counsel, comes up with nothing as every one of his contemporaries has before him, it will be the biggest waste of taxpayer dollars —  and of Americans’ time —  in a long time. Listen to the audio here, or at the link to the story from our own Dan Riehl: UPDATE 11:16 A. M.

Marco Rubio ( ) the former 2016 Trump GOP primary rival astutely noted that basically the only thing that did not leak to the press is the one fact that would have helped Trump —  that Trump himself was not under investigation. That is despite the fact that Congressional leaders were briefed on that point.

This is probably the first time ever that people in Washington, D. C. —  the Swamp —  are upset that President Donald Trump is NOT Tweeting. UPDATE 11:10 A. M. Video of Comey wishing there are tapes of his conversations with Trump: Comey: ”I’ve seen the tweet about tapes. Lordy, I hope there are tapes.” (via @MSNBC) pic. twitter.   —   Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 11:07 A. M. Breitbart’s Joel Pollak has an excellent piece up already on how Comey’s opening statement to the Committee this morning is all about him. “Former FBI director James Comey opened his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday by complaining about ‘shifting explanations’ for why he had been fired, and by attacking the Trump administration,” Pollak writes. “Comey said that he had originally intended to accept his firing quietly, but then found that the administration’s statements about the matter ‘confused me and increasingly concerned me.’ He said that President Donald Trump had assured him that he was doing a good job, and that he had assured the president in return that he intended to stay. ” Read the whole thing. Also, it’s worth noting that even the Wall Street Journal —  not some rightwing blog by any stretch —  even says that Comey’s written opening statement proves that President Trump should have fired him. Which is exactly what President Trump did. Read the Journal’s editorial board piece here. UPDATE 11: 00 A. M. The GOP war room is up and running. Our friends over at the Republican National Committee are cutting videos that shows Comey’s testimony actually fully vindicates President Trump, despite whatever the opposition party media and congressional Democrats say:  Politico has an RNC talking points document circulated this morning. Read the whole thing here. Politico also has a story on how the RNC is taking the lead on pushing back on the highly discredited Comey’s testimony. “The RNC’s role is to support and defend the president and this White House and this week is no different,” Ryan Mahoney, the RNC communications director, told Politico. “And we prepare for everything, and we’re prepared for the hearing this week. ” Read the whole piece here. UPDATE 10:59 A. M. Despite the fact there have been a number of inaccurate pieces throughout the establishment media, the establishment media is celebrating itself.

Feinstein tells Comey he’s “big” and “strong,” then asks him if he was overwhelmed by the Oval Office and wonders why he did not tell the president he was wrong when he brought this subject up with him. He questions whether he would have handled himself the same way if given a second chance. “I hope there are tapes,” Comey also said of his meetings with Trump, noting he has seen the president’s Tweet about the possibility of tapes. UPDATE 10:55 A. M. Comey, under questioning from Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( ) says his relationship with Trump got off to a rocky start. He also embarrasses her when she asks him if the reason he was fired had anything to do with the Russia investigation, and he said “yes, because the President said so. ” Here in Union Pub, the   crowd broke out into laughter. UPDATE 10:53 A. M. Comey just killed the case against Trump over “obstruction of justice” that the media is building, as fast as they began building it. He said Trump saying he hopes Comey lets the investigation of Flynn go was not an order to drop the investigation. UPDATE 10:51 A. M. The media is highlighting two separate things early on in the Comey bonanza: The fired former FBI director’s use of the word “lie” twice, and him being concerned about meetings with President Trump. Establishment media going to do their thing. Comey has now used ”lie” twice. 1. Referring to WH defaming him and the FBI: ”those were lies”:2.

M. Since Comey has nothing, and the whole case is falling apart, Hillary Rodham Clinton’s   Brian Fallon is sadly offering up that special counsel Robert Mueller is now investigating Trump. WH plan of declaring victory because Trump was not being investigated in January is now moot. Comey made clear Mueller is investing him now,  —   Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) June 8, 2017,  But, sadly, if they have no evidence Trump colluded with the Russians —  probably because it is likely no evidence even exists —  then the special prosecutor will find the same thing that Comey found: NOTHING. But, nevertheless Hillary Clinton’s acolytes persisted: Comey said he expects Mueller to assess, as part of his investigation, whether Trump obstructed justice. That would mean he’s a subject now.  —   Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:40 A. M. Comey testified that he was “confused” about being fired by President Trump.

Despite the fact that Comey has nothing, but instead actually ended up in his written opening statement vindicating President Trump, the media elites in Washington are celebrating Comey’s “poker face” —  as if it means something substantive. James Comey’s poker face is savage. #ComeyTestimony,  —   Michelle Ruiz (@michelleruiz) June 8, 2017,  UPDATE 10:30 A. M. As Comey comes under questions from Burr, our very own Joel Pollak notes that Comey’s altered opening statement was a deeply personal statement furthering the giant nothingburger he put out last night through the committee. Comey failing again so far, just like he did when he was working on the Hillary Clinton email scandal last year. So far the Comey testimony is all about him  all about political retribution against the president for firing him. Disgraceful performance,  —   Joel B.

"Speaker Ryan on PM Theresa May: ’This is a Time For Bold Leadership’, U.S. ’Committed’ To Bilateral Trade","Despite months of clear bilateral focus from the White House and the apparently death of the controversial Transatlantic Trade Investment Partnership (TTIP) speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan used a political speech in London to claim the deal was progressing. [Speaking at an event hosted by establishment think tank Policy Exchange on Wednesday evening attended by several members of the UK Parliament, Ryan talked up future trade deals with Britain  —   but also brought up the secretly negotiated TTIP trade arrangement with the European Union that many considered dead with the arrival of President Trump, and had been the subject of major protests across Europe. He said:  Now that Article 50 has been invoked, the UK and EU will determine the best path forward over the course of negotiations. We want the parties to come together and strike a lasting agreement. A strong   relationship is in all of our best interests. In that same vein, the United States will continue to work closely with our EU friends, and chart a path forward on   negotiations. At the same time, we are committed to work with President Trump and your government to achieve a bilateral trade agreement between the United States and Great Britain. This is one of the bipartisan messages I bring with me: that the United States stands ready to forge a new trade agreement with Great Britain as soon as possible, so that we may further tap into the great potential between our people. One of those who sounded the   of TTIP was Professor Ted Malloch, the man widely regarded as Trump’s pick for ambassador to the European Union, who spoke on the Breitbart Daily Show in January to give his perspective. Giving a blunt  of the health prospects of the trade negotiations that would have seen the secretive and undemocratic agreement, Professor Malloch said: “TTIP is a   it isn’t going to happen in the Trump world. ” The European Union itself, which has pressed for TTIP to be passed despite years of fruitless negotiations, may find themselves surprised by the apparent reversal of policy claimed by Speaker Ryan. The bloc had conceded defeat on the matter with the election of President Trump as early as last year, reported Breitbart London, with EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström remarking it would make no sense to expect further talks on the issue.  "
Trump campaign says it raised $51M since late May,"Washington (CNN) Donald Trump’s campaign on Wednesday announced it raised $51 million since late May, a sign that his first major fundraising foray has proved moderately successful. The haul is likely to calm some fears that Trump will be unable to compete financially with Hillary Clinton, who has spent tens of millions of dollars on ads while Trump raised his first dollars. But Trump still starts in a deep hole compared to her    he had only $1. 3 million on hand as of June 1    and the new figures nevertheless reveal that he will be substantially dependent on the Republican National Committee. Clinton’s campaign announced last week it had raised $68 million in June for her campaign and joint fundraising committees. But unlike Trump, most of that cash went to her official campaign, giving her more control over how to spend it. Trump raised $26 million via   fundraising, and $25 million from 22 fundraisers for his joint fundraising committee, the campaign said. The lion’s share of the online money will go to Trump’s official campaign, and a heavy majority of the joint committee cash will head to the RNC.  The campaign did not specify how much would go to each group, or how much was raised in June as opposed to the last week of May. The RNC spends its cash not purely on presidential politics    as Trump’s campaign would    but rather on helping the entire Republican ballot. Trump personally contributed $3. 8 million to his campaign as well, bringing the total to $55 million. He did not reveal an updated    figure, a key piece of data that he will be required to share as part of a federal elections report later this month. ”The results from this month show the enthusiastic movement the campaign has created. People want to invest in a better future for America and Make America Great Again! The campaign very much appreciates the broad support,” the campaign said in a statement. Later Wednesday afternoon, Trump appealed to his Twitter followers for donations, tweeting, ”To all of my twitter followers, please contribute whatever you can to the campaign. We must beat Crooked Hillary.” Trump only started fundraising in earnest in late May, and his national fundraising schedule took him from Texas to Arizona to West Virginia in the month of June. His campaign has struggled to attract top bundlers, and he is expected to trail Clinton by at least $500 million in total dollars raised. Yet his digital operation remains a sign of promise: His campaign claimed that one of his fundraising emails collected $2 million at once, and a powerful   operation backed by his most fervent supporters could help close the gap with Clinton. And Trump is expanding his   network, too. The Trump campaign and the RNC announced this month that they are adding about 85 fundraising veterans to their operation. Trump’s fundraising shop previously consisted publicly of only about 20 people. Trump’s campaign said it attracted more than 400, 000 supporters, with 94% of them giving less than $200. Full details of Trump and Clinton’s June fundraising numbers must be reported to the Federal Election Commission by July 20."
Clinton Campaign Chairman Mocks Hillary: ’Laughing Too Hard Is Her Authentic Weirdness’ - Breitbart,"Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta mocked her tendency to laugh loudly at inappropriate times in another embarrassing snit between top Democrats, leaked emails reveal. [Podesta and senior advisor to advocacy group Engage Cuba Luke Albee discussed the contentious House Committee hearing held about her conduct during the deadly terrorist attack on a U. S. embassy in Benghazi, Libya.  “Thought she was really good. Really good. She sometimes laughs a little too hard at jokes that aren’t that funny. Other than that  …    A,” Albee wrote on Sept. 20, 2015. “Laughing too hard is her authentic weirdness,” Podesta replied that day. Albee later smeared South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, who led the questioning, as a Klu Klux Klan member: “Was sensitive enough not to wear his sheet to the hearing,” he wrote back to Podesta on Oct. 22, 2015. “I think he protested too much. Made this all about Committee’s legitimacy and not what happened,” Podesta said. The leaked email is part of a series of releases from Wikileaks regarding the Clinton campaign. Remarking on Hillary Clinton’s quirk of laughing loudly at odd moments has been repeatedly derided as “sexist” by the mainstream media."
Blue State Blues: The White House Loves the Russia ’Scandal’ - Breitbart,"The Trump White House seems quietly to be enjoying the Russia hacking “scandal. ”[Certainly it has its    frustrations, especially for Sean Spicer, who has to face the press corps and its obsession with meaningless minutiae.  But the joke is on the journalists. They are spending so much time on the   that they are missing what President Donald Trump is actually doing. He complains on Twitter about the coverage, but the truth is that the distraction is very useful. The “scandal” is no longer about Russia. Now it is about how House Intelligence Committee chair Devin Nunes ( ) found information backing up Trump’s claims that his team was under surveillance by the Obama administration. Was Nunes approached by whistleblowers who came to his congressional office? Or were the whistleblowers sent by the White House to Nunes? It makes no difference at all, but the media think they are onto something very important. CNN called it a “” without specifying what, exactly, Nunes was supposed to be “covering up. ” And the answer is: nothing. Even if  —   for argument’s sake  —   the White House had approached Nunes rather than the other way around, the worst that could be said about it is that Nunes behaved like a partisan Republican. If so, he is no more partisan than ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff ( ) who is abusing his position to launch conspiracy theories against the GOP. The core of Schiff’s case, as presented at the House Intelligence Committee last Monday, is a lie  —   namely, the false claim that the Republican Party altered its platform at the behest of Trump aides in order to appease the Russians. As Byron York of the Washington Examiner has demonstrated, the Republican platform was “was actually strengthened, not weakened” against Russia. Schiff is still pretending that some other evidence will emerge on   ties. But the idea Russia colluded with the Trump campaign is ludicrous, for three reasons. The first is there is no evidence whatsoever to support that claim. Obama’s own James Clapper and Mike Morell even said so  —   though it took Trump’s tweets about “wiretapping” to flush them out of hiding. Second, the Russians could not have known that Trump would win, and would not have targeted Clinton alone when it seemed that she could exact punishment once she took office. The third reason is that Hillary Rodham Clinton was arguably the most   official since Alger Hiss. From the Russian “reset,” to giving up missile defense, to the   New START treaty, to the uranium giveaway, to the loss of the Middle East, and to the loss of the Crimea (which happened on her successor’s watch, while she remained silent) Clinton ran the State Department almost like a   satellite. Indeed, if Donald Trump really wanted to appease Russian President Vladimir Putin, it would be hard to find anything left with which to appease him. The Russians saw Trump’s criticism of NATO as useful, and applauded him. But they likely preferred Clinton. Already, Trump has been much tougher on Russia than Obama ever was. From blasting Russia at the UN Security Council over the eastern Ukraine, to threatening to tear up the New START treaty, Trump has opposed Putin  —   and it shows. Trump foreign policy adviser Sebastian Gorka, formerly of Breitbart News, is also a vociferous critic of Russia. So the Russia “scandal” is much ado about nothing. But it keeps the media distracted from what Trump is really doing  —   such as taking a chainsaw to Obama’s regulations  —   and it keeps the Democrats from developing an actual message. The beauty of it all? Aside from Trump’s tweets, the media and the Democrats are creating this distraction themselves. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

Biden announces $2.45 billion federal loan to Amtrak,"Washington (CNN) Vice President Joe Biden announced Friday a $2. 45 billion loan to Amtrak from the Department of Transportation, the largest loan in the department’s history. Biden announced the new loan at his namesake Joseph R. Biden Jr. Train Station in Wilmington, Delaware. The $2. 45 billion will be used to purchase 28 new train sets for the   Acela train between Washington through New York and into Boston. The money will also be used to rehabilitate railroad tracks and upgrade four stations, including Washington’s Union Station and Baltimore’s Penn Station. America’s crumbling infrastructure, ”This loan is a key step to providing investments needed to help keep high speed trains moving throughout the region, and to help all commuters in the Northeast Corridor,” Biden said. ”We need these kinds of investments to keep this region    and our whole country    moving, and to create new jobs.” CNN reported in May that many aspects of US rail systems    particularly along the Northeast Corridor    are in need of repair and rehabilitation. The price of renewing and safeguarding the web of railways that covers the over   East Coast stretch stands at an estimated $20 billion. Amtrak is funding the train sets and infrastructure improvements through the Federal Railroad Administration’s Railroad Rehabilitation  Improvement Financing program that will be repaid through growth in Northeast Corridor revenues, Amtrak has said. Amtrak is already heavily subsidized by the federal government. The system’s 2015 adjusted operating loss was $306. 5 million, the most recent year for which data is available, and the service requested $1. 83 billion in federal funding for the 2017 fiscal year, Amtrak told CNN Friday.  Amtrak’s funding has long been a topic of discussion in Congress. ”Why in this country are we so boneheaded to not understand the essential value of a rail system that is modern throughout the whole country? Why do we argue about whether or not it makes sense,” an impassioned Biden asked in Wilmington, calling the Northeast Corridor an ”overall security net” for the economy. ”We can’t make this country work without rail,” he added. The vice president’s support for Amtrak has been  . As a senator, he made the commute to Washington from Wilmington nearly every workday for more than 35 years. ”If we get elected, it will be the most   administration ever,” he told a fellow passenger shortly after being named Barack Obama’s running mate in 2008. Eight years later, he called Amtrak staff ”my best friends in the world.” ”I have traveled over 2, 100, 000 miles on Amtrak. I have made over 8, 000    roughly 8, 400 round trips. I believe it’s about 257 miles a day. And these men and women have become my family,” Biden said Friday. He admitted he’s cut back on rail travel since becoming vice president: ”I only do it once a week now. Secret Service here, it drives them crazy. They want me to fly.”"

Thousands take to the streets to protest Trump win," (CNN) They chanted   Trump slogans. They flooded city streets. They gathered near the White House, disheartened and dismayed. ”Not my President, not today,” many across the nation yelled. In cities from Boston to Los Angeles, thousands of demonstrators gathered Wednesday night in protest of election results that mean the billionaire real estate developer will be the next president.  As many as 5, 000 people were at a protest in New York, police estimated. Among the issues being yelled about outside Trump Tower were immigration and other controversial topics from the campaign. ”I came out here to let go of a lot of fear that was sparked as soon as I saw the results,” protester Nick Powers said. He said he feared Trump will support stronger    policies that would put many people in prison. He was worried that Trump’s victory would embolden sexist views.  Many of the protests were in cities with large Democratic bases    in Atlanta Austin, Texas Boston Chicago Denver Philadelphia Portland, Oregon San Francisco, Seattle and Washington.  In Chicago, people walked down a normally busy Lake Shore Drive carrying signs. Many headed to Upper Wacker Drive, where a crowd was growing near the Trump Tower. CNN’s Ryan Young estimated the throng at a few thousand people covering the street for half a mile. Many were using a vulgar chant aimed at the  .  One college student showed CNN a sign that said, ”I still can’t believe I have to protest for civil rights.” ”It’s been really frustrating, because as a nation we thought we had come so far but it seems like we’re taking many steps back,” another woman said, ”so we want to come together to change that and make sure we keep going forward.” In Portland, marchers chanted ”No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA” as they trekked through downtown. Protesters in D. C. who headed to the Trump International Hotel, shouted the same slogan. After an earlier solemn gathering at the White House a few dozen young people remained, their cries profane. Hundred of mostly young Latino protesters marched on Los Angeles City Hall Wednesday night. As the protest grew throughout the night, protesters set on fire a piñata depicting the head of  . They chanted ”I will not live in fear,” ”Fight back, stand up” and ”¡Si se puede!” (Spanish for ”It can be done”). Several protesters said they feared that family or friends might be deported once Donald Trump is sworn into office. In Austin, protesters blocked a highway Wednesday afternoon.  Students burned a flag on the campus of American University in Washington, and they walked out of class in high schools and colleges across the country the day after the Presidential election.  In downtown Los Angeles, high school students crowded the steps of City Hall on Wednesday afternoon.  Protester Brooklyn White was holding a sign that said ”Hate won’t win.”  The    voted for Hillary Clinton and was disappointed.   ”We can’t let it stop us. If he’s the President then fine, but if  Donald Trump is gonna be it then he has to listen,” she said.  At Berkeley High School in California, about 1, 500 students walked out of classes Wednesday morning. In Des Moines, Iowa it was hundred of high school students who left class to protest of election results.  In Phoenix, about 200 students from Carl Hayden High School marched to the state Capitol in protest.   Earlier Wednesday, trash fires burned on an Oakland, California, highway as an illuminated sign in the nation’s capital proclaimed that the United States was ”better than bigotry.” The Oakland Police Department said as many as 6, 000 demonstrators had marched in the streets by Wednesday night. ”People are furious not just at the results of the election, but the rhetoric of Donald Trump,” Ahmed Kanna, an organizer for Social Alternative Berkeley, told CNN’s Don Lemon. White House candlelight vigil, A candlelight vigil for Clinton supporters in front of the White House on Wednesday evening drew those who wanted to mourn their election loss. The peaceful crowd called out ”you are not alone” to over 2, 600 people watching the gathering on Facebook, organizers said.   Maybelline McCoy, an immigrant from Panama, came to the vigil with her three children.   ”My biggest fear is that they will be limited, that they will see people being silenced and invalidated and that I won’t be able to shield them,” she said.  Protests after the vote count, In the wee hours of Wednesday morning after the votes were counted, one member of the crowd near the White House held an   American flag, alongside the LGBT rainbow flag, in silent protest. Brian Barto, a protester who had remained at the White House after most dispersed, told CNN affiliate   in Washington that he was ”destroyed, honestly distraught.”  ”Everything that has been built up has been destroyed. . .. America has failed (minorities).” Latasha Wilson said she was scared about the next four years. ”He doesn’t respect women, Black Lives Matter, Latinos. He’s a racist. . .. There are multiple things that add up,” she said of the  . Supporters celebrate, Others went to the White House late Tuesday and early Wednesday to show their support for Trump.  Nicholas Elliot, a student at Washington’s Georgetown University, said he was elated about Trump’s election.  ”I feel pretty good, a year and a half process has ended and it ended my way,” the Texan told WJLA. He said he thought it was ”definitely the responsibility of both parties” to unite the country.  Referencing the United Kingdom’s Brexit vote to leave the European Union, which ”translated strongly here,” he said he had no fear his candidate would lose.  ”There is a hidden vote,” he said, contending people didn’t voice their true voting intentions to pollsters in case they were perceived as sexist, racist or homophobic.  In New York on Wednesday morning, groups of Trump supporters cheered his victory outside Trump Tower.  Pop star Lady Gaga, a vocal Hillary Clinton supporter who had performed at the Democratic candidate’s final rally in North Carolina, stood atop a sanitation truck outside Trump Tower in New York, brandishing a sign that read: ”Love trumps hate.”  Images and footage shared on social media showed dumpster fires on what was described as a stretch of Broadway, from 14th to 20th streets in the city.  At the University of Louisville in Kentucky, the base of a   bronze cast of Rodin’s ”The Thinker” was   with the message: Trump #BuildThatWall.” "
DHS secretary: Electronics ban may be expanded to flights departing US," (CNN) Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly confirmed to CNN Friday that he is considering expanding the ban on large electronics in airplane cabins to include flights departing from the US to overseas.  If that happens, then it would mean any electronic device larger than a cell phone would not be allowed on some flights leaving the US, not just certain inbound US flights, as is currently the case. Kelly was at Reagan National Airport  just outside the nation’s capital in Virginia Friday, meeting and shaking hands with Transportation Security Administration officers and speaking briefly on camera to reporters.  When asked whether it is true that he has hinted the laptop ban could expand to US soil, Kelly said that those characterizations of his thinking are accurate. ”No, they didn’t misread me,” he answered. ”I would tell you that the threats against passenger aviation worldwide are constant. The good news is that we have great intelligence collection overseas    US intelligence collection. We also have great sharing with partners overseas. So, we are doing everything we can to get after these threats    but they are real.” The original ban applies to certain   flights, including those originating in Cairo, Egypt Dubai and Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates Istanbul, Turkey Doha, Qatar Amman, Jordan Kuwait City Casablanca, Morocco and Jeddah and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  But Kelly signaled this month that he’s looking at possibly expanding the ban due to security concerns. ”The protocol where we put large electronic devices down inside the cargo compartments, . .. I made that decision based on intelligence from a certain part of the world    sophisticated threats,” Kelly said Friday. ”We are now looking at kind of a worldwide hard look at raising the bar, the minimum bar, on aviation security. So, still contemplating extending the ban, as we work with partners.” He added, ”We will make a decision when the time is right.”"
What happened the night of the Secret Service crash?,"Washington (CNN) The circumstances surrounding the two Secret Service Agents under investigation for allegedly driving under the influence and reportedly interrupting an active bomb investigation remain murky, according to accounts from law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation. CNN interviews with multiple sources reveal that while the two agents were returning from a farewell party, it’s still unclear when, exactly, the agents were stopped, and what gave the impression that they weren’t entirely sober. RELATED: Top House Republican: Secret Service failings put Obamas in ’jeopardy’ According to one source, the agents implicated in the incident are George Ogilvie, a top supervisor in the Washington field office, and Mark Connolly, a   member of President Barack Obama’s personal security detail.  Ogilvie was driving Connolly back to his car, parked on West Executive drive, the source said, after a farewell party for retiring agency spokesman Edwin Donovan held at Clyde’s restaurant near downtown D. C.’s Verizon Center. The two agents drove through the area that was part of the suspicious package investigation, first apparently driving under the police tape.   Multiple sources emphasized that, at least in arriving at the initial security checkpoint, the agents did not appear to be behaving erratically. A law enforcement source familiar with the incident said ”the car was moving pretty slowly,” a speed another source described as ”literally one mile an hour.” The Washington Post reported that the agents under investigation disrupted an active bomb investigation and drove right past the package. The Post has also reported the agents appeared intoxicated. While approaching the first security checkpoint at the White House, the car nudged an orange barrel out of the way, moving it just a few feet, one source said. There was no collision, the source said, and no damage to the car. The source said the security checkpoints went smoothly  —   the car was stopped at the first for a few seconds while the agents’ IDs were checked, and again at the second, where officers checked the car for explosives using a dog and a detection device. This source could not explain when the conduct of the agents became an issue with the other officers, but indicated it didn’t happen during the initial security checkpoints  —   opening the possibility that the incident under investigation took place at a later point that night. A U. S. law enforcement official confirmed to CNN that the officers in question were allowed to go home that night after a supervisor on duty overruled   law enforcement who wanted to arrest the agents and conduct sobriety tests, a breach of protocol that’s sparked a Homeland Security Inspector General investigation. Secret Service Director Joe Clancy did not learn about the incident until five days after it occurred, according to a law enforcement source close to the investigation. Sources could not say whether that was before or after the White House was informed. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Thursday decried the latest misconduct from the agency, with House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz saying the situation ”begs a lot of questions” and warning the state of the Secret Service has put the first family at risk. ”The more I’ve learned about [the incident] the more concerned I’ve become,” he said on CNN. ”We’re very united, Republicans and Democrats, in saying that the safety of the president is paramount, and we’re putting this person in jeopardy, and his family in jeopardy.”"
UnitedHealthcare Sues Dialysis Chain Over Billing - The New York Times,"Private health insurers can pay more than $4, 000 for each dialysis treatment. Government health plans like Medicaid pay around $200. That gaping price difference was the motivation for a scheme, orchestrated by a   dialysis chain, that illegally pushed poor people in Florida and Ohio out of inexpensive government programs and into expensive private plans sold by UnitedHealthcare, according to a lawsuit the giant insurer filed in federal court on Friday. UnitedHealthcare says the arrangement needlessly exposed the patients to medical bills. The suit accuses American Renal Associates, a public company that operates nearly 200 dialysis clinics across the country, of fraudulently billing millions of dollars since the beginning of the year. UnitedHealthcare is trying to recoup that money. The insurer argues that the effort was aided by the American Kidney Fund, a nonprofit patient advocacy group, which paid the patients’ premiums for private insurance. The insurer said American Renal Associates “earmarked donations” to the kidney fund to pay for the coverage, violating   laws in the process. The lawsuit also says that the company’s patients were not told that the kidney fund would stop paying their premiums if they received a kidney transplant. The kidney fund, which is not listed as a defendant in the lawsuit, is overwhelmingly financed by dialysis companies. American Renal Associates said on Friday that the lawsuit was without merit and that the company would vigorously defend itself. “At all times, we are dedicated to putting patients first, and we structure all of our relationships within that framework,” Michael R. Costa, vice president and general counsel, said in a statement. The American Kidney Fund declined to comment on the specifics of the lawsuit, but said it was “deeply troubled” by the allegations of what it described as “improper use” of its program by a dialysis provider. The company says it keeps contributions from providers separate from decisions about whether to offer assistance to patients, an arrangement that it said was “affirmed” by the federal government in 1997. In a statement, its chief executive, LaVarne A. Burton, said that the group did not recommend particular facilities or insurers and that nearly   of the 79, 000 patients receiving assistance from the fund were on Medicare. The assistance the fund provides, she said, “is a lifeline for people who depend on dialysis for their survival. ” The suit, filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, touches on an issue regulators have focused on in recent years: the role of third parties paying for insurance. Federal and state regulators have expressed concern about payments made by outside groups that are closely tied to industry, where the goal appears to be less about helping patients than about generating profits. This week, the top insurance regulator in Idaho said insurers could refuse payments from organizations like the American Kidney Fund. Minnesota made a similar decision in June. “There are third parties out there just trying to help people,” said Dean L. Cameron, director of the Idaho Department of Insurance, citing religious organizations as an example. But the practice becomes problematic when the funding is tied to the doctor or the facility providing care, he said. “Those kinds of arrangements concern us. ” The dialysis industry has come under scrutiny from federal regulators in recent years for a variety of actions, including overbilling Medicare. Many dialysis centers say they lose money because the government programs pay them so little. People who need dialysis and have   renal disease are eligible for Medicare coverage, even if they are under 65. If they are poor, they may also qualify for Medicaid, which covers nearly all    costs. Patients may be enrolled simultaneously in both programs. At the same time, UnitedHealthcare has a keen financial interest in keeping very ill patients, like those who need dialysis, out of its private plans. Under the federal health care law, insurers must cover everyone, no matter how sick they are. Dialysis removes toxins from the blood when the kidneys do not work properly, and many patients need treatments three times a week for years. According to the lawsuit, American Renal Associates devised a clever plot aimed at converting patients over to private plans. The company identified poor patients in rural areas of Florida who did not have a nearby dialysis clinic in UnitedHealthcare’s network, the suit says. The centers then persuaded these patients to switch to UnitedHealthcare plans, using the American Kidney Fund’s program to pay their premiums. Finally, the centers billed UnitedHealthcare    prices of about $4, 000 per dialysis treatment, compared with just $200 under Florida’s Medicaid program, the suit said. Because the UnitedHealthcare plans required greater    contributions than Medicaid’s coverage, the centers waived any part of the dialysis bill that was not paid by the insurer. UnitedHealthcare says patients remained responsible for bills from other doctors, which they would not have had to pay under Medicaid. Kidney transplants, rather than dialysis, are seen as the best options for most patients with   renal disease, but the American Kidney Fund does not pay for premiums after patients receive a kidney transplant. Patients were not informed of that. Ms. Burton, the kidney fund chief executive, said the fund’s work was focused on people who need dialysis and not on transplant patients. “Our greatest hope is that the people we are assisting will receive transplants, but the reality is that most people with kidney failure have to spend time on dialysis,” she said in the statement. A   player in the dialysis industry, American Renal Associates enters into partnerships with kidney specialists to run its clinics. A New York private equity firm, Centerbridge Partners, owned the company before it went public in April. In its public filings, the company acknowledges its dependence on treatments paid by private insurers. Those payments cover just 13 percent of the treatments the clinics provide, but account for 40 percent of the company’s operating revenue. This reliance on privately insured patients is typical of the dialysis industry, said Eric R. Havian, who represented a   in a 2014 case involving charges of kickbacks against DaVita HealthCare Partners, one of the industry’s biggest players. Even if only a few people receive private insurance at a center, Mr. Havian said, “they may make enough profit on those two or three patients to wipe out all the losses they are incurring from the Medicaid patients, and make enormous profits on top of that. ” UnitedHealthcare said it had already paid about $2 million to American Renal Associates this year. It provided details about 27 patients in Florida and Ohio, but said there could be more. Insurers say that charities with ties to providers are a concern when they pay premiums only for people with a specific health condition, because doing so often raises overall prices. “What we’ve seen happening in the marketplace is some companies have been targeting people who use their services to enroll them in private coverage,” said Alissa Fox, a senior vice president with the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, a trade group. The American Kidney Fund’s   program is one of the hallmarks of the group’s mission. The group says on its website that it assists one in five dialysis patients in the United States with health care expenses. The fund has close ties to the dialysis industry: It acknowledges that dialysis companies pay for its   program, and in 2015, 78 percent of its $264 million in revenue came from two companies, according to its financial disclosures. The kidney fund declined to name the companies. The organization’s chairwoman is a former executive at DaVita and Fresenius Medical Care, the nation’s two leading dialysis chains. Those industry ties expose the profit motive that underpins the programs, according to Patrick Burns, executive director of Taxpayers Against Fraud, a   advocacy group. “There is a bottom line here, and the people who manage these programs are well aware of it, on both sides,” he said."
Talking About Sex and ‘The Affair’ With Dominic West - The New York Times,"For two seasons, Noah Solloway was the resident punisher in “The Affair,” the Showtime drama about a novelist who leaves his moneyed wife for a waitress grieving the death of her son  —   and spins the experience into a best seller. But my how the tables have turned. “It’s a show that very much deals with people in extremity, and this season it seems to be poor old Noah, which is obviously quite interesting to play,” Dominic West said of his onscreen alter ego. (Season 3 begins Sunday, Nov. 20, at 10 p. m.) The tangled web picks up three years after Noah chivalrously claimed responsibility for a    to protect the women he loved. His stint in prison has left him traumatized, persecuted by a guard he knew in childhood. His father has just died. And someone is following him at the New Jersey college where he has been forced to trade in his formerly opulent life for tattered academia. In a phone interview from London, where he lives when not shooting the series in New York, Mr. West, 47, talked about infidelity, redemption and the womanizer some viewers love to hate. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Were you surprised that Noah took the fall for Helen and Alison? I thought it was quite a neat trick, actually. I was often dismayed by Noah’s behavior and the seeming irrationality of it. So I was quite glad that he had done something noble that was in some way his redemption. And I suppose that was my first thought: “Thank God, he’s turning out to be a hero after all. ” A couple of important new characters have been added, starting with the French actress Irène Jacob as Juliette. Is she a love interest? Very much so. Noah has this romance with a beautiful Frenchwoman who represents something, I suppose, completely out of his universe. She’s a professor of medieval literature, and the idea of courtly love is, I think, very important to Sarah [Treem, the showrunner] as a contrast to what’s going on in America in terms of sexual politics on campus, consent and a   idea as to what relationships and intimacy are about. And what about Brendan Fraser, who plays Gunther, the menacing prison guard? I think Sarah has been reading a lot of Jung, because another big theme is the idea of the doppelgänger and the shadow, and the notion that if we’re not in some kind of synthesis with our darker side then terrible things happen. So in some way Gunther is Noah’s doppelgänger. He was a childhood friend, and there is jealously and rivalry. His character now has the upper hand and puts him in solitary confinement, where Noah comes face to face with his demons. And it takes Noah into sort of delusional territory so that, as the season goes on, we’re not quite sure what’s real and what is invented. Why do you think the series is so polarizing? It’s deliberately provocative. It’s deliberately melodramatic. There’s never a moment where there aren’t six things going on in the protagonist’s mind that aren’t highly traumatized and mentally extreme. And a lot of the characters don’t behave in a way that is necessarily sympathetic, and that is entirely deliberate on Sarah’s part, because she’s interested in taking them on a journey where they have redemption, and they overcome their shortcomings. And I couldn’t really argue with that, even if I didn’t really like the behavior myself. What are your own thoughts about infidelity? It’s extraordinary what a hot topic it is and how everybody has a very strong view about it, so that’s a very good premise for a TV show. What I didn’t want to happen, and I don’t think it has happened, is that it would be a sort of morality tale where, “Don’t have an affair, kids, because you’ll end up killing people and going to jail with Brendan Fraser. ” [Laughs] With so much talk about sexual impropriety and infidelity during the election, I’m wondering if you find either a disqualifier for a leadership role. Is it a disqualifier when a presidential candidate talks about groping women? Yes, it’s one of the more visceral, obvious disqualifiers for any presidential nominee. But the dreadful thing is that it’s not something the majority of people feel. A lot of couples watch “The Affair” together. Do you watch it with your wife?  Certainly not! I can’t really watch myself for very long without cringing and rushing for the off button. And my wife has watched little bits and said, “Very well done and marvelous, and I don’t need to watch any more. ”"
71-Year-Old Dana Rohrabacher Staffer Knocked Unconscious by Anti-Trump Protesters - Breitbart,"A    staffer for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( ) was knocked unconscious by   protesters as she attempted to leave her office, according to a report from CBS Los Angeles. [Kathleen Staunton, who works as Rohrabacher’s district director, had the door of her Huntington Beach office yanked open in front of her as she tried to leave, causing her to trip, hit her head, and fall unconscious. A    girl also got caught up in the incident, but thankfully was not harmed.  In a statement, Rohrabacher said that he was “outraged beyond words that protesters who mobbed my Huntington Beach office violently knocked down my faithful district director, Kathleen Staunton, causing her to be hospitalized. ” “And, yes, deliberate or not, the incident came as part of a mob action that not only intimidates but coerces. Though the protesters think of themselves as idealists, they engaged in political thuggery, pure and simple,” he continued.

Politico: Steve Bannon’s First Pick for President Was Sarah Palin,"Ruairí   writes at Politico that before Stephen K. Bannon “embraced the mogul from Manhattan,” the former Breitbart Executive Chairman and current chief strategist to Donald Trump had his eye “on another gifted populist” outsider  —   former Alaska governor Sarah Palin. Both Bannon and Palin realized that the Republican Party needed to “drain the swamp” in DC and champion the forgotten American working class if it ever wanted to regain the White House again. [From Politico:  Steve Bannon thought he had found his perfect presidential candidate. This person was “an outsider,” someone who was “not part of the political establishment,” “not for sale,” with “an ‘America First’ foreign policy approach” and “a ‘Drain the Swamp’ mentality about Washington, DC. ” What Bannon loved most was how this person seemed to “put the American worker —  the little guy —  first. ” Except Bannon wasn’t thinking about Donald Trump. The dream candidate he had in mind? Sarah Palin. Years before the partisan provocateur of the 2016 cycle hitched himself to the upstart populist billionaire from New York, Bannon openly fantasized about transforming the former governor of Alaska into the very kind of   who could humiliate the elites of both parties, the very kind of   outsider that Trump, with Bannon’s help, would ultimately prove to be. So he put all his energy into helping the   Mama Grizzly eat Washington’s lunch. This was back in 2011 and Bannon, a filmmaker whose credits at the time included an homage to Ronald Reagan and two films on the Tea Party movement, told the National Review that he saw “a direct lineage” between the Tea Party movement and the Reagan Revolution, and he was desperate to find a contemporary Reagan. For Bannon, the upcoming 2012 election was an opportunity to “fight for the soul of the Republican Party. ” He told an audience in Chicago in July of that year, “If we want to get eviscerated and have another 2008, all we have to do is run an establishment Republican. ” It was just a few months earlier that Rebecca Mansour, currently the Senior West Coast Editor at Breitbart News and previously an aide and speechwriter to Sarah Palin, reached out to Bannon to ask if he would make some short videos for a potential Palin presidential campaign. Mansour told Politico recently that Bannon was enthusiastic about her boss’s potential candidacy it was Bannon, she said, who identified Palin as an “outsider” with a “drain the swamp” mentality. Bannon saw in Palin someone who, in his own words, presented “an existential threat to not just the progressive left, but also to the entrenched country club Republican Party. ” Read the rest here. "
Washington family killings suspect charged with murder,"Washington (CNN) The man charged with the killing of three members of a prominent Washington, D. C. family and their housekeeper did not act alone, prosecutors said they believe.  Darron Dellon Dennis Wint made his first appearance before a District of Columbia judge Friday to face   murder charges following the discovery last week of the victims in a scorched mansion.  Earlier reports identified the suspect as Daron Dylon Wint, but newly obtained court documents show that this was just one of several aliases that he apparently used his legal name is Darron Dellon Dennis Wint. Prosecutors alleged that Wint did not pull off the slayings and arson on his own.  The crime ”required the presence and assistance of more than one person,” according to the criminal complaint.  Court documents reveal that the incident began sometime after 6 p. m. on May 13, and continued through the afternoon of the next day. The fire at the mansion was reported at 1:24 p. m. on May 14, but the victims had been held against their will since the previous day.  Wint’s attorney questioned the evidence, but the judge went forward with the charges and ordered Wint to remain imprisoned without bond.  As of Friday, no one else had been charged in connection to the killings.  D. C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier said, ”it’s pretty obvious that there was coordination” in the crime, but cautioned that it remains unclear what form that help took.  Lanier told CNN: ”Whether there was someone else that actually took part in the kidnapping and the murder, it’s going to take time to get this evidence together, and we just don’t want to jump to conclusions or draw conclusions too soon.” While five others who were arrested along with Wint had been questioned and released, investigators are interviewing others, the chief said.  A grisly discovery, The arrest came a week after the grisly discovery of the bodies of Savvas and Amy Savopoulos, and their son, Philip. The fourth victim, housekeeper Veralicia Figueroa, was found alive at the home and taken to the hospital, where she died.  A day after they ”barely missed” catching him in New York, Cmdr. Robert Fernandez of the U. S. Marshals Service said, authorities spotted Wint, 34, leaving a Howard Johnson hotel in College Park, Maryland.  They tracked, surrounded and stopped Wint, who was riding in the back of a Chevrolet Cruze, and they also stopped a small moving truck that had been traveling alongside in northeast Washington. Officers found $10, 000 in cash during the arrest, according to the criminal complaint, Three women were with Wint in the car, and two men were in the moving truck, including Wint’s brother. Though questions remain, the victims’ families breathed a little easier knowing that a suspect is in custody. ”While it does not abate our pain, we hope that it begins to restore a sense of calm and security to our neighborhood and to our city,” the Savopoulos family said in a statement.  Signs of trouble before the fire, The fire in the $4. 5 million home in one of Washington’s toniest neighborhoods, not far from the home of Vice President Joe Biden, was a story in itself.  But soon it became evident that the blaze wasn’t the full story. The victims were bound with duct tape, and they suffered from   trauma, according to a source familiar with the investigation. There were signs that Philip, the    son, had been stabbed and tortured, according to the source.  According to court documents released Friday, the boy’s body was found in a bedroom on the second floor, which sustained heavy fire damage. The body was on the charred remains of a   bed, the documents state. The fire consumed a majority of the bed frame.  Figueroa’s husband, Bernardo Alfaro, raised the prospect that the victims’ torment started a day earlier, telling CNN affiliate   that his wife didn’t come home the night of May 13. Alfaro knocked on the mansion’s door the next morning, noting that family’s blue Porsche was parked on the street. He knew something was wrong, according to WJLA. He suddenly got a phone call from Savopoulos telling him that Figueroa was at a hospital with Amy Savopoulos, who wasn’t feeling well. ”I started thinking, ’Why? She doesn’t drive. She doesn’t speak very good English,’ ” Alfaro said. A second housekeeper, Nelitza Gutierrez, also received a text message from Amy Savopoulos hours before the fire began, telling her to stay home. It came a day after Gutierrez got a voice mail message from Savvas Savopoulos telling her not to come the following day because his wife was sick. ”Sometimes you never understand why something happens, but I’m lucky I’m still here,” Gutierrez told CNN’s Joe Johns. Source: ’Whoever was in the house was looking for money’ What really happened is largely a mystery. The motive for the killings has not been divulged, but investigators are considering that money may have been a prime factor. ”Whoever was in the house was looking for money,” said the source familiar with the investigation. According to the court documents, as the episode unfolded inside, one of Savopoulos’ employees came to the home and dropped off $40, 000. Wint and other suspects made off with the money, the documents state.  The money had been earmarked for a martial arts studio that Savvas Savopoulos was opening up in Chantilly, Virginia. Savopoulos was a martial arts enthusiast, according to online posts, and Wint once worked for American Iron Works. Savvas Savopoulos was the CEO and president of American Iron Works, a building materials manufacturer based in Hyattsville, Maryland. DNA on pizza crust, Investigators identified Wint as a suspect in an unusual way. On the night of May 13, a Domino’s deliveryman brought two pizzas to the Washington home while the family members and their housekeeper were being held inside against their will, according to the criminal complaint. The pizza boxes were found in the same place where three of the victims were located. The pizza was ordered by a woman    believed to be Amy Savopoulos    and paid for with her credit card, according to the court documents.  The pizza order included instructions for the pizza to be left at the door because the woman who ordered it claimed she was nursing a sick child and couldn’t come to the door, the documents state.  The delivery man placed the pizzas on the front porch, rang the door bell, and left.  Investigators said they traced Wint to the scene after finding his DNA on pizza crust.   calls Wint ’kind, gentle, nonaggressive’ An attorney who represented Wint in six earlier cases    none of which, he says, ended in guilty verdicts    said he believes authorities have ”the wrong guy.” Even if his DNA was found on pizza crust, it doesn’t mean Wint went inside the Savopoulos mansion, much less bound and killed anyone, attorney Robin Ficker told CNN’s ”New Day.” A video released by Washington police of a man outside the mansion didn’t show any identifying facial features, the attorney said.  ”I know him to be a kind, gentle, nonaggressive person (he is) someone you wouldn’t mind your grandmother going to lunch with,” the Maryland lawyer said. ”. .. It’s a rush to judgment. There’s a presumption of innocence, which is not being mentioned by police.” According to court records, Wint has faced multiple charges over the years, including theft, assault and a sexual offense. He was cleared of some of them, but he has three assault convictions in New York. He attended Marine Corps recruit training in 2001 but left before completing the camp. It was not clear why. A neighbor of Wint’s parents expressed sympathy for them. ”I feel very sad for them, for the pain they’re going through, which is not their fault,” Devera Zianal said. ”Whatever happened, if he is guilty, he had choices. I know he was not raised this way.” Friends mourn slain family"

"Bomb Scare Brings Chaos to the Heart of Hollywood, Sets Off Commuter Nightmare - Breitbart","A suspicious package lying against the third rail of the Metro Red Line in the heart of Hollywood prompted city officials to shut down a major segment of Hollywood Blvd, wreaking havoc for commuters on Friday at 4:30 p. m. [The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s bomb squad was summoned to investigate the package. Consequently, they shut down the Hollywood station on the corner of Hollywood Blvd and Highland. Moreover, for safety precautions nearby stations at   City and   were also temporarily closed, reported ABC 7.

Judge Blocks Trump Order on Refugees Amid Chaos and Outcry Worldwide - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   A federal judge in Brooklyn came to the aid of scores of refugees and others who were trapped at airports across the United States on Saturday after an executive order signed by President Trump, which sought to keep many foreigners from entering the country, led to chaotic scenes across the globe. The judge’s ruling blocked part of the president’s actions, preventing the government from deporting some arrivals who found themselves ensnared by the presidential order. But it stopped short of letting them into the country or issuing a broader ruling on the constitutionality of Mr. Trump’s actions. The   legal case played out on Saturday amid global turmoil, as the executive order signed by the president slammed shut the borders of the United States for an Iranian scientist headed to a lab in Massachusetts, a Syrian refugee family headed to a new life in Ohio and countless others across the world. The president’s order, enacted with the stroke of a pen at 4:42 p. m. Friday, suspended entry of all refugees to the United States for 120 days, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely, and blocked entry into the United States for 90 days for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security said that the order also barred green card holders from those countries from   the United States. In a briefing for reporters, White House officials said that green card holders from the seven affected countries who are outside the United States would need a    waiver to return. Mr. Trump  —   in office just a week  —   found himself accused of constitutional and legal overreach by two Iraqi immigrants, defended by the American Civil Liberties Union. Meanwhile, large crowds of protesters turned out at airports around the country to denounce Mr. Trump’s ban on the entry of refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Lawyers who sued the government to block the White House order said the judge’s decision could affect an estimated 100 to 200 people who were detained upon arrival at American airports. Judge Ann M. Donnelly of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama, ruled just before 9 p. m. that implementing Mr. Trump’s order by sending the travelers home could cause them “irreparable harm. ” She said the government was “enjoined and restrained from, in any manner and by any means, removing individuals” who had arrived in the United States with valid visas or refugee status. The ruling does not appear to force the administration to let in people otherwise blocked by Mr. Trump’s order who have not yet traveled to the United States. The judge’s   ruling came swiftly after lawyers for the A. C. L. U. testified in her courtroom that one of the people detained at an airport was being put on a plane to be deported back to Syria at that very moment. A government lawyer, Gisela A. Westwater, who spoke to the court by phone from Washington, said she simply did not know. Hundreds of people waited outside of the courthouse chanting, “Set them free!” as lawyers made their case. When the crowd learned that Judge Donnelly had ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, a rousing cheer went up in the crowd. Minutes after the judge’s ruling in New York City, another judge, Leonie M. Brinkema of Federal District Court in Virginia, issued a temporary restraining order for a week to block the removal of any green card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport. In a statement released early Sunday morning, the Department of Homeland Security said it would continue to enforce all of the president’s executive orders, even while complying with judicial decisions. “Prohibited travel will remain prohibited,” the department said in a statement, adding that the directive was “a first step towards   control over America’s borders and national security. ” Around the nation, security personnel at major international airports had new rules to follow, though the application of the order appeared chaotic and uneven. Humanitarian organizations delivered the bad news to overseas families that had overcome the bureaucratic hurdles previously in place and were set to travel. And refugees already on flights when the order was signed on Friday found themselves detained upon arrival. “We’ve gotten reports of people being detained all over the country,” said Becca Heller, the director of the International Refugee Assistance Project. “They’re literally pouring in by the minute. ” Earlier in the day, at the White House, Mr. Trump shrugged off the sense of anxiety and disarray, suggesting that there had been an orderly rollout. “It’s not a Muslim ban, but we were totally prepared,” he said. “It’s working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over. ” But to many, the government hardly seemed prepared for the upheaval that Mr. Trump’s actions put into motion. There were numerous reports of students attending American universities who were blocked from returning to the United States from visits abroad. One student said in a Twitter post that he would be unable to study at Yale. Another who attends the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was refused permission to board a plane. A Sudanese graduate student at Stanford University was blocked for hours from entering the country. Human rights groups reported that legal permanent residents of the United States who hold green cards were being stopped in foreign airports as they sought to return from funerals, vacations or study abroad. There was widespread condemnation of the order, from religious leaders, business executives, academics, political leaders and others. Mr. Trump’s supporters offered praise, calling it a necessary step on behalf of the nation’s security. Homeland Security officials said on Saturday night that 109 people who were already in transit to the United States when the order was signed were denied access 173 were stopped before boarding planes heading to America.   people who were stopped were eventually given waivers to enter the United States, officials said. Legal residents who have a green card and are currently in the United States should meet with a consular officer before leaving the country, a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told reporters. Officials did not clarify the criteria that would qualify someone for a waiver, other than that it would be granted “in the national interest. ” But the   administration appeared to be implementing the order chaotically, with agencies and officials around the globe interpreting it in different ways. The Stanford student, Nisrin Omer, a legal permanent resident, said she was held at Kennedy International Airport in New York for about five hours but was eventually allowed to leave the airport. Others who were detained appeared to be still in custody or sent back to their home countries. White House aides claimed on Saturday that there had been consultations with State Department and homeland security officials about carrying out the order. “Everyone who needed to know was informed,” one aide said. But that assertion was denied by multiple officials with knowledge of the interactions, including two officials at the State Department. Leaders of Customs and Border Protection and of Citizenship and Immigration Services  —   the two agencies most directly affected by the order  —   were on a telephone briefing on the new policy even as Mr. Trump signed it on Friday, two officials said. The A. C. L. U.’s legal case began with two Iraqis detained at Kennedy Airport, the named plaintiffs in the case. One was en route to reunite with his wife and son in Texas. The other had served alongside Americans in Iraq for a decade. Shortly after noon on Saturday, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, an interpreter who worked for more than a decade on behalf of the United States government in Iraq, was released. After nearly 19 hours of detention, Mr. Darweesh began to cry as he spoke to reporters, putting his hands behind his back and miming handcuffs. “What I do for this country? They put the cuffs on,” Mr. Darweesh said. “You know how many soldiers I touch by this hand?” The other man the lawyers are representing, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, who was en route to Houston, was released Saturday night. Before the two men were released, one of the lawyers, Mark Doss, a supervising attorney at the International Refugee Assistance Project, asked an official, “Who is the person we need to talk to?” “Call Mr. Trump,” said the official, who declined to identify himself. While the judge’s ruling means that none of the detainees will be sent back immediately, lawyers for the plaintiffs in the case expressed concern that all those at the airports would now be put in detention, pending a resolution of the case. The White House said the restrictions would protect “the United States from foreign nationals entering from countries compromised by terrorism” and allow the administration time to put in place “a more rigorous vetting process. ” But critics condemned Mr. Trump over the collateral damage on people who had no sinister intentions in trying to come to the United States. Peaceful protests began forming Saturday afternoon at Kennedy Airport, where nine travelers had been detained upon arrival at Terminal 7 and two others at Terminal 4, an airport official said. Similar scenes were playing out at other airports across the nation. An official message to all American diplomatic posts around the world provided instructions about how to treat people from the countries affected: “Effective immediately, halt interviewing and cease issuance and printing” of visas to the United States. Internationally, confusion turned to panic as travelers found themselves unable to board flights bound for the United States. In Dubai and Istanbul, airport and immigration officials turned passengers away at boarding gates and, in at least one case, ejected a family from a flight it had boarded. Seyed Soheil Saeedi Saravi, a promising young Iranian scientist, had been scheduled to travel in the coming days to Boston, where he had been awarded a fellowship to study cardiovascular medicine at Harvard, according to Thomas Michel, the professor who was to supervise the research fellowship. But Professor Michel said the visas for the student and his wife had been indefinitely suspended. “This outstanding young scientist has enormous potential to make contributions that will improve our understanding of heart disease, and he has already been thoroughly vetted,” Professor Michel wrote to The New York Times. A Syrian family of six who have been living in a Turkish refugee camp since fleeing their home in 2014 had been scheduled to arrive on Tuesday in Cleveland. Instead, the family’s trip has been called off. “Everyone is just so heartbroken, so angry, so sad,” said Danielle Drake, the community manager for US Together, an agency that resettles refugees. A Christian family of six from Syria said in an email to Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania, that they were being detained on Saturday morning at Philadelphia International Airport despite having legal paperwork, green cards and visas that had been approved. In the case of the two Iraqis held at Kennedy Airport, the legal filings by his lawyers say that Mr. Darweesh was granted a special immigrant visa on Jan. 20, the same day Mr. Trump was sworn in as president. A husband and father of three, Mr. Darweesh arrived at Kennedy Airport with his family. Mr. Darweesh’s wife and children made it through passport control and customs, but agents of Customs and Border Protection detained him. In Istanbul, during a stopover on Saturday, passengers reported that security officers had entered a plane after everyone had boarded and ordered a young Iranian woman and her family to leave the aircraft. Iranian green card holders who live in the United States were blindsided by the decree while on vacation in Iran, finding themselves in a legal limbo and unsure whether they would be able to return to America. “How do I get back home now?” said Daria Zeynalia, a green card holder who was visiting family in Iran. He had rented a house and leased a car, and would be eligible for citizenship in November. “What about my job? If I can’t go back soon, I’ll lose everything. ”"
Leaked Documents Confirm Facebook Deciding Which News Stories Trend - Breitbart,"Mere days after Tom Stocky, Facebook’s Trending News manager, rejected reports that his subordinates “artificially inject” items into its list of trending news stories, a leak of internal guidelines published in The Guardian show that the company does exactly that. [The document shows that Facebook’s team behaves like a typical Old Media outlet, with editors selecting and approving stories at virtually every stage of the process. The company also keeps a list of 1, 000 “trusted” outlets that it uses in its Trending News feature.  The document also instructs staffers to check if a story is headlining on mainstream outlets like CNN, BBC, Fox News, and The New York Times before assigning it “ ” importance. This is in stark contrast to the company’s outward claim that its Trending News feature merely reflects what’s currently trending among its userbase. Moreover, editors are given the power to insert new topics into the trending list, provided they pass a particular threshold of popularity. This specifically contradicts a claim by Tom Stocky, the company’s manager of Trending News, who earlier this week said “we do not insert stories artificially into trending topics, and do not instruct our reviewers to do so. ” This follows a week of damaging reports from anonymous sources at the company, who told Gizmodo that members of Facebook’s Trending News feature, which is intended to reflect only the most popular news topics being discussed on Facebook, routinely discriminated against conservative news sources.  This news is likely to add to the political momentum building against Facebook, which now faces the prospect of a congressional inquiry into political bias at the company. Earlier this week, Republican Senator Jim Thune sent CEO Mark Zuckerberg a letter demanding answers on the issue. The RNC has also put out a statement calling on Facebook to address its bias against conservatives. According to The Guardian, the lesson of the latest leak is clear. Facebook, once the centre of a supposedly   social media revolution, is now starting to behave like a traditional mainstream media outlet. Its news operation is “now akin to a traditional media organization,” says The Guardian.  In a statement to the newspaper, Facebook   Justin Osofsky maintained that it did not discriminate politically. The guidelines demonstrate that we have a series of checks and balances in place to help surface the most important popular stories, regardless of where they fall on the ideological spectrum. Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to systematically discriminate against sources of any political origin, period. What these guidelines show is that we’ve approached this responsibly and with the goal of creating a   product  —   in the hopes of delivering a meaningful experience for the people who use our service.

"U.S. Combat Missions May End, but Fighting Goes On - The New York Times","President Obama inherited two wars from his predecessor, George W. Bush, and has struggled to wind them down. American troops are still in both Iraq and Afghanistan, but their missions have changed and there are far fewer troops in combat than at the heights of those wars a decade ago. Didn’t Mr. Obama declare an end to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan? Yes. Mr. Obama declared an end to the combat mission in Iraq in 2010, and the one in Afghanistan in 2014. But we still have thousands of troops in both countries. Why are the troops still there? Mr. Obama sent American forces back to Iraq in 2014 after the Islamic State seized wide stretches of territory there and was threatening to take Baghdad. In 2015, Mr. Obama, saying he continued to oppose the idea of an “endless war,” said he would keep thousands of troops in Afghanistan to continue to target remnants of Al Qaeda and to help Afghan forces defeat the Taliban. How many troops do we have in each country? The Pentagon will not say exactly. Military officials say there are roughly 5, 000 troops in Iraq and 11, 000 in Afghanistan. At the heights of those conflicts a decade ago, the United States had more than 150, 000 troops in Iraq and 100, 000 in Afghanistan. Wait, why don’t we know exactly how many troops are in each country? The Pentagon says that for “force protection” reasons it cannot say how many service members there are in the theater. Mr. Obama has set a cap of 4, 087 troops for Iraq and 9, 800 in Afghanistan. The Pentagon can exceed the caps because it uses an accounting system that exempts many groups from being counted, including troops that commanders plan on having in the country for less than four months. What is the mission of those troops?  Most of them are dedicated to what is called “train, advise and assist,” in Pentagon jargon. In layman’s terms, that means helping the Iraqis and Afghans beat back their enemies without actually sending Americans out to do a lot of the fighting, as the United States did a decade ago. The other mission is a counterterrorism one in which American troops and airmen take direct action against Islamic State and Qaeda militants. So what does that mean our troops are doing on a    basis? In both countries, Air Force jets conduct strikes on militants, safe houses, ammunition depots and training camps. On the ground, commandos launch raids to kill and capture militants military advisers train local commanders and soldiers, at times, fight alongside the local forces. Does that mean the troops are in combat? The White House does semantic cartwheels to say neither mission is combat. In 2014, when Mr. Obama first sent troops back into Iraq, he was unequivocal in his description of their mission. “I want the American people to understand how this effort will be different from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,” he said. “It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil. ” The White House has stuck to the notion that the troops are not in combat. Pentagon officials roll their eyes at such denial, and senior officials  —   including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  —   have publicly called it combat. How has Mr. Obama changed the United States’ role in Iraq? At the end of 2011, Mr. Obama  —   who had campaigned on ending the war in Iraq  —   decided to pull out the 50, 000 troops we still had in the country and declared an end to our mission there. After the Islamic State took substantial territory in Iraq in 2014, Mr. Obama sent several hundred advisers back to Iraq to determine the strength of the Iraqi military and how the United States could help it combat the Islamic State. By the end of that year, he had increased the United States’ involvement, and roughly 1, 550 troops were in the country. In 2015, the number climbed to 3, 000, and this year Mr. Obama increased it to over 4, 000. When are the troops going to return home? Military commanders say more troops are likely to be sent into Iraq in support of Iraqi forces preparing to try to retake Mosul. The troops in Afghanistan were initially supposed to return home by 2017. But the Taliban have had a significant resurgence, and the troops are likely to remain there through next spring, if not longer. According to the website icasualties. org, six American service members have died in Iraq this year and three in Afghanistan. In the past decade and a half, 4, 501 Americans have died in Iraq and 2, 381 in Afghanistan."
Stephen Miller Exposes Faux-Feminism of CNN Panel with Facts About Muslim Migration and Open Borders - Breitbart,"Members of Sunday morning’s panel on CNN State of the Union are oblivious to the barbaric,   practice facing hundreds of thousands of U. S. girls as a result of unbridled Muslim migration.[      When the CNN panel sought to criticize Donald Trump for his   sexist retweet that has monopolized the news cycle for several days, Trump’s senior policy advisor Stephen Miller punched back, slamming Washington’s political class and corporate media for expressing “feigned indignation” about a retweet while ignoring serious issues facing U. S. women. “The political class in Washington D. C. works itself up into a feigned indignation about things that don’t actually affect the lives of the American people,” said Stephen Miller. He went on: I think it says a lot about the conscience of Washington D. C. how many hours we’ve spent discussing a retweet. And it would be nice if   the outrage that has been spent in feigned indignation over this retweet had instead been spent this summer when Kate Steinle was murdered in cold blood by an illegal immigrant in San Francisco. Congress did nothing when an American citizen was murdered and died in her father’s arms in cold blood. Miller explained that the political class in Washington D. C. gets mad about the wrong things. Miller then proceeded to list issues that should actually be a source of righteous indignation: “We don’t get mad when Americans are murdered by illegal immigrants, we don’t get mad when people have their jobs taken by cheaper foreign workers here on visa programs, we don’t get mad when entire cities are crushed by our trade policies that send jobs overseas  …     So I think a big part of the Trump campaign is that people want to get mad about the right things. ” Miller continued: It’s a choice that the political class makes in D. C. in terms of what they want to focus on  …     It is a trivial issue to be debating retweets when it is a fact that you have Americans dying every single day as a result of our immigration policies. You want to talk about women’s issues? Here’s something we should be talking about. This is a fact: as a result of uncontrolled migration into this country —   you can look this up, this is a statistic from Equality Now  —   half a million U. S. girls in this country are at risk of female genital mutilation. The fact that half a million U. S. girls are   of female genital mutilation as a result of   Muslim migration has been widely documented by publications ranging from NPR, to ABC, to Reuters, to Newsweek, to the Daily Beast, to the Huffington Post, to the Atlantic, to the New York Times.  As the New York Times wrote in February of 2015, “Genital Cutting Cases Seen More as Immigration Rise. ” As Newsweek reported in February of 2015, immigration is “the sole factor for the rise in numbers”: More than half a million women and girls in the U. S. are at risk of undergoing FGM in the U. S. or abroad, or have already undergone the procedure, including 166, 173 under the age of 18, according to the Population Reference Bureau (PRB). Immigration to the U. S. from African and Middle Eastern countries —  where the practice of FGM is a deeply entrenched cultural tradition —  is the sole factor for the rise in numbers, says Mark Mather, a demographer at PRB who led the data analysis. There has not been an increase in the practice happening in the U. S. itself, he says  …     African immigration to the U. S. has doubled every decade since 1970, with more than 1. 8 million   people now living in the U. S. according to Census data. Immigrants from Ghana, Nigeria, Ethiopia and Egypt, all countries that perform FGM( also known as female circumcision) accounted for 41 percent of total African immigrants. According to the latest numbers, nearly one in five girls at risk for FGM in the U. S. are from Egypt, which tops Somalia as the most   country  …     Immigration to Western countries where FGM is not traditionally practiced means health care providers have had to adapt to the harmful medical consequences of FGM. While this statistic has been widely reported, it is almost never mentioned on major television news programming on corporate media. Indeed, not only was the CNN panel unaware of the fact that half a million U. S. girls are   of suffering the barbaric practice of having their external genital organs removed, but one panelist —   a   feminist —   bizarrely sought to deny the veracity of the report and cover up the gruesome reality facing hundreds of thousands of U. S. girls. “This is exactly what happens with Donald Trump,” said Neera Tanden, a   feminist and president of the Center for American Progress. “He says something outrageous. ” Miller pushed back: “You don’t think that statistic is correct?” Tanden said that she did not believe the statistic was accurate: “No, I don’t think half a million girls. ” On her twitter page, Tanden describes herself as, “progressive, Indian American, feminist, mom, wife. Not in that order. ” While Tanden was quick to attack Miller’s   statement, it is unclear from the exchange how her decision to enable the violent practice against women  —   by casually dismissing its prevalence  —   comports with her values as a “progressive  …     feminist. ” The Atlantic has described how the procedure is carried out: It usually involves the complete removal of the clitoris, and often the removal of some of the inner and outer labia. In its most extreme form —  infibulation —  almost all the external genitalia are cut away, the remaining flesh from the outer labia is sewn together, or infibulated, and the girl’s legs are bound from ankle to waist for several weeks while scar tissue closes up the vagina almost completely. A small hole, typically about the diameter of a pencil, is left for urination and menstruation. The cutting is usually done with a razor, a kitchen knife, or a pair of scissors. It is rare for any anesthesia to be used. In 2012, Al Jazeera recounted the experience of one London woman: Aissa describes how her sister was taken away by a woman to “wait for her turn” while Aissa’s stepmother instructed her to lay down on a bed. Aissa did as she was told, as four women stood over her pinning her to the bed as another woman began to cut her. No anaesthetic was used to remove Aissa’s clitoris with a razor blade. Aissa explains that it doesn’t matter how tightly you are held down, your body instinctively convulses, which results in deeper and longer incisions. ‘The pain is, well, it’s so difficult to describe to you what it is like. Imagine when you cut your finger, it’s a million times worse than that. But that doesn’t even begin to describe the type of pain that takes over when the part of your body that has the most nerve endings in it is cut away. Only girls who have been cut will ever know what that level of pain is like. I honestly thought I was going to die, and then everything went black.’ However, on Sunday’s panel, Tanden pushed back against Miller’s claim by suggesting that Donald Trump’s tone remains a more pressing women’s issue than the physical assaults and murders carried out by migrants against U. S. women: The fact is that if we actually want to fight sexism in America I agree with Doug that the wrong way to go is Donald Trump, who judges women on their looks, who says terrible things about women in every way he could possibly do, and the reality is that the reason why he’s losing women in the general electorate, the reason why independent women, young conservative women say they will never support Donald Trump is because of what he does every day. The CNN panel also included Nina Turner, a former state Senator in Ohio. On her Twitter page, Turner describes herself as a “wife, mother, sister” and “fighter for the people. ” According to the Population Reference Bureau, over 24, 000 girls in Ohio are at risk of Female Genital Mutilation. Despite the rise of the misogynistic practice in her home state  —   which has emerged solely as a result of unchecked Muslim migration  —   Turner did not express support for Trump’s proposal to temporarily pause Muslim migration during the panel. Nor did Turner praise Trump for his decision during a recent GOP debate to highlight the hostile attitude towards women promoted by Islam. The CNN panel also included political class operative Doug Heye, the former deputy    for communications to failed House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. Cantor was defeated in a crushing primary election due to his support for mass migration. During the CNN panel, Heye  —  whose former boss pushed immigration policies that would have resulted in greater violence against American women  —   made clear that what really offended him morally was the idea of supporting Donald Trump for President: “I’ll never be a Donald Trump supporter,” Heye said. During the panel discussion, Miller further addressed the economic effects of immigration and highlighted how Trump’s position on immigration and trade differs from that of Sen. Ted Cruz: In 2013, Sen. Cruz pushed an amendment to the Gang of Eight bill which would have actually doubled immigration including Muslim migration. And if you look at polling, by a    margin, Americans —  Democrats, Independent, Republican, black, white, Hispanics —   by a    margin agree that we should raise wages for people already living here instead of importing more foreign workers. So that’s a very mainstream issue. So if you look at really two issues that Cruz has been very aggressive on —  pushing more foreign workers, and pushing offshoring and more   free trade deals —  he is far outside the mainstream of the GOP and the American electorate. So we think we’re going to do very well in Wisconsin by focusing on trade and immigration issues that appeal to the broadest swath of the electorate.   OO. ready( function()  ) })"
"One Week after Brexit, Only UK Stocks Are Higher - Breitbart","Despite all the hysteria from media and political elites that claimed the UK would stagnate if British voters passed Brexit to leave the EU, it turns out that UK stocks are higher a week later while the other stock markets are still down. [In perhaps the most arrogant establishment response on the first day after the Brexit vote, Harvard educated James Traub, wrote in the elite Foreign Policy Magazine: “It’s Time for the Elites to Rise Up Against the Ignorant Masses. ” Traub demanded that elites use their power to nullify the vote by the “fist shaking” British rabble, because it represented an “utter repudiation of the bankers and economists and Western heads of state who warned voters against the dangers of a split with the European Union. ”  But a week after the referendum victory for the “leave” voters, the British stock market index is up +2. 6 while the French shares tanking  .3 percent, German equities tumbling  .3 percent and U. S. stocks down about 1 percent. The UK remains a member of the European Union, and will do for some considerable time to come. Which means for the terms of trade, regulation, free movement and so on, the UK government and private sector are operating under precisely the same rules as they did a week ago. Any “impacts” therefore are the result of expectations  —   or uncertainty  —   about what will change in the future. According to the stock markets where individuals put real money behind their expectations, the UK is financially better off from the Brexit while France and Germany are worse off. For the United States investors, the Brexit is not financially a big deal. As Breitbart News predicted, Brexit caused a 10 percent decline in the exchange rate of the British pound versus the euro. But this means that British exports are cheaper and more competitive in continental Europe while the Continent’s goods are more expensive. This explains why UK stocks are up. Breitbart News also predicted that the UK’s sovereign credit rating would be cut, but markets already expected the downgrade and UK bonds traded up as interest rates fell to the lowest point since the   century. The Brexit vote has already slowed immigration to the UK and there appears to be the possibility of a sharp reversal of migration flows between the UK and the rest of Europe. In first hours following the June 23 Brexit vote, the   establishment demanded that the United Kingdom pay a punitive economic price for having the audacity to threaten the EU’s viability. According to EU President Martin Schulz: “The British have violated the rules. It is not the EU philosophy that the crowd can decide its fate. ” The only punitive suggestion against the UK so far is that the European Parliament threat to eliminate English as the official government language. But English is the only language spoken by the majority of the other 27 nations of the EU. Despite Germany’s financially domination of the EU, few of the 26 other member states speak “Deutsch. ” Europe and the United Kingdom had already created a     across the western continent by the 1980s, through the European Economic Community and the European Trade Association. So Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, famously said in 2007, “The most puzzling development in politics during the last decade is the apparent determination of Western European leaders to   the Soviet Union in Western Europe. ” Big Government, Breitbart California, National Security, Brexit, communism, EU, ignorant masses"
How much are the Rio Olympic gold medals worth?,"Rio de Janeiro (CNN) The making of the 2016 Rio Olympic and Paralympic medals is a mix of art and science.  A team of about 100 people, including sculptors and machine operators, have been working in secret inside the Brazilian Mint to produce more than 5, 000 medals ahead of the Games.   And while the athletes will be earning the medals, the makers of the medals feel an equal connection to their shiny masterpieces. ”Seeing them on the podium, I’ll know I made that medal,” said Nelson Neto Carneiro, the sculptor who made the mold for the 2016 medals. ”I’ll feel like I’m getting a medal myself.”  Carneiro has made many coins during his   tenure at the Brazilian Mint, but he said sculpting the Olympic medals is one of the most exciting projects he has done.  While the mold can be made using a computer, Carneiro worked on it for two weeks by hand with precision tools that, he says, gave him more control over the design. Once the   mold is scanned into a computer a CNC router, or a   cutting machine, etches the metallic mold. Then the mold is put under a microscope for quality control before heading to the factory.   Factory workers then use a loud press machine to strike the mold with 550 tons of force    three times    to create the coveted round symbols of victory. The gold medals go through an extra step called the ”bath of gold.” The gold medal is actually made of 494 grams of silver and 6 grams of gold.   The Games kick off August 5 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The melted gold and silver of a gold medal is worth about $587 in current market prices. The last time Olympic medals were made of pure gold was during the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden."

Is Giving the Secret to Getting Ahead? - The New York Times,"Editor’s note: We’re resurfacing this 2013 magazine article to remind you that tirelessly helping others could be the key to hyperefficiency. Just after noon on a Wednesday in November, Adam Grant wrapped up a lecture at the Wharton School and headed toward his office, a   speed walk away. Several students trailed him, as often happens at conferences, Grant attracts something more like a swarm. Grant chatted calmly with them but kept up the pace. He knew there would be more students waiting outside his office, and he said, more than once, “I really don’t like to keep students waiting. ” Grant, 31, is the   and   professor at Wharton. He is also one of the most prolific academics in his field, organizational psychology, the study of workplace dynamics. Grant took three years to get his Ph. D. and in the seven years since, he has published more papers in his field’s   journals than colleagues who have won   awards. His influence extends beyond academia. He regularly advises companies about how to get the most out of their employees and how to help their employees get the most out of their jobs. It is Grant whom Google calls when “we are thinking about big problems we are trying to solve,” says Prasad Setty, who heads Google’s people analytics group. Plenty of people have made piles of money by promising the secrets to getting things done or working a   week or figuring out what color your parachute is or how to be a brilliant   manager. But in an academic field that is preoccupied with the study of efficiency and productivity, Grant would seem to be the most efficient and productive. When we arrived at Grant’s office on the Philadelphia campus, five students were waiting outside. The first was a student trying to decide between Teach for America and a   job at Google. Grant walked her through some other possibilities, testing her theories about potential outcomes. Although she was aware of the crowd, she seemed to be in no hurry to leave, in part because Grant was so clearly engaged. A second student came in. Then a third. Someone dropped off a bottle of wine to say thank you another asked for a contact (Grant pledges to introduce his students to anyone he knows or has met, and they shop his LinkedIn profile for just that purpose). For every one of them, Grant seemed to have not only relevant but also scientifically tested,   advice: Studies show you shouldn’t move for location, since what you do is more important than where you do it. Studies show that people who take jobs with too rosy a picture get dissatisfied and quit. If you truly can’t make a decision, consider delegating it to someone who knows you well and cares about you. Is there anything else I can help you with? How else can I help? He was like some kind of  . Grant might not seem so different from any number of accessible and devoted professors on any number of campuses, and yet when you witness over time the sheer volume of Grant’s commitments, and the way in which he is able to follow through on all of them, you start to sense that something profoundly different is at work. Helpfulness is Grant’s credo. He is the colleague who is always nominating another for an award or taking the time to offer a thoughtful critique or writing a lengthy letter of recommendation for a student  —   something he does approximately 100 times a year. His largess extends to people he doesn’t even know. A student at Warwick Business School in England recently wrote to express his admiration and to ask Grant how he manages to publish so often, and in such   journals. Grant did not think, upon reading that   I cannot possibly answer in full every such query and still publish so often, and in such   journals. Instead, Grant, who often returns home after a day of teaching to an   of 200   responded, “I’m happy to set up a phone call if you want to discuss!” He attached handouts and slides from the presentation on productivity he gave to the Academy of Management annual conference a few years earlier. For Grant, helping is not the enemy of productivity, a   diversion from the actual work at hand it is the mother lode, the motivator that spurs increased productivity and creativity. In some sense, he has built a career in professional motivation by trying to unpack the puzzle of his own success. He has always helped he has always been productive. How, he has wondered for most of his professional life, does the interplay of those two factors work for everyone else? Organizational psychology has long concerned itself with how to design work so that people will enjoy it and want to keep doing it. Traditionally the thinking has been that employers should appeal to workers’ more obvious forms of  : financial incentives, yes, but also work that is inherently interesting or offers the possibility for career advancement. Grant’s research, which has generated broad interest in the study of relationships at work and will be published for the first time for a popular audience in his new book, “Give and Take,” starts with a premise that turns the thinking behind those theories on its head. The greatest untapped source of motivation, he argues, is a sense of service to others focusing on the contribution of our work to other people’s lives has the potential to make us more productive than thinking about helping ourselves. “Give and Take” incorporates scores of studies and personal case histories that suggest the benefits of an attitude of extreme giving at work. Many of the examples  —   the selfless C. E. O. ’s, the consultants who mentor ceaselessly  —   are inspiring and humbling, even if they are a bit intimidating in their natural expansiveness. These generous professionals look at the world the way Grant does: an   filled with requests is not a task to be dispensed with perfunctorily (or worse, avoided) it’s an opportunity to help people, and therefore it’s an opportunity to feel good about yourself and your work. “I never get much done when I frame the 300   as ‘answering ’ ” Grant told me. “I have to look at it as, How is this task going to benefit the recipient?” Where other people see hassle, he sees bargains, a little work for a lot of gain, including his own. The message sounds terrific: Feel good about your work, and get more of it done, and bask in the appreciation of all the people you help along the way. Nice guys can finish first! (Now there’s research to prove it.) But I couldn’t help wondering, as I watched Grant race through his marathon day (even one of his mentors admitted, “He can be exhausting”) about the cost of all this  . If you are devoted to being available to everyone, all the time, how do you relax? How can you access the kind of creativity that comes from not being on task every waking moment? How do you make time for the more important relationships in your life? As Grant’s office hours came to an end four and a half hours later, he patiently continued offering help until he finally had to close the door and tell a student to try him by phone he would squeeze him in on his commute or by  . But he would not say no. The study of job design in the   and   century focused on how to improve the drudge work of manufacturing: Grant is credited with reviving the field, shifting the thinking toward the more modern conditions of a service and knowledge economy. He first realized that his ideas about giving at work might actually yield quantifiable results when he was a    graduate student at the University of Michigan, and he proposed a study set in a university   call center. Call centers, even on college campuses, are notoriously unsatisfying places to work. The job is repetitive and can be emotionally taxing, as callers absorb verbal abuse while also facing rejection (the rejection rate at that call center was about 93 percent). The manager, Howard Heevner, did not have a lot of faith that Grant would be able to motivate his  . He had already tried, in a previous job at a call center, the usual incentives  —   cash prizes, competitive games  —   and was generally unimpressed with the results. But Grant had a different idea. When he was an undergraduate at Harvard, he took a job selling advertisements for the travel guide series “Let’s Go,” but he was terrible at it. “I was a pushover,” he says in “Give and Take,” “losing revenues for the company and sacrificing my own commission. ” Then he met another undergraduate whose job at “Let’s Go” was helping her pay her way through college. Suddenly the impact of his role became clear to him: without advertising revenues, the company could not make money, which in turn meant it couldn’t provide jobs to students who needed them. With that in mind, he was willing to make a harder sell, to take a tougher line on negotiations. “When I was representing the interests of students, I was willing to fight to protect them,” he writes. It would not be a   psychology book if every anecdote did not have a dramatic ending: Grant eventually sold the largest advertising package in company history and less than a year later, at 19, was promoted to director of advertising sales, overseeing a budget of $1 million. As a psychology major, Grant always hoped to do a study on the “Let’s Go” staff, in which the books’ editors and writers would meet with or read letters by people whose travels had been enhanced by their work. Would knowing how the books benefited others inspire them to work harder? Now, at the call center, Grant proposed a simple,   experiment: given that one of the center’s primary purposes was funding scholarships, Grant brought in a student who had benefited from that  . The callers took a   break as the young man told them how much the scholarship had changed his life and how excited he now was to work as a teacher with Teach for America. The results were surprising even to Grant. A month after the testimonial, the workers were spending 142 percent more time on the phone and bringing in 171 percent more revenue, even though they were using the same script. In a subsequent study, the revenues soared by more than 400 percent. Even simply showing the callers letters from grateful recipients was found to increase their   draws. When Grant went back and talked to the callers about their improvement, many actively discounted the possibility that the brief encounter with a scholarship student helped. “Several of them were stunned,” Grant said. “Their response was, ‘Yeah, I knew I was more effective, but that was because I had more practice,’ or, ‘That was because I had a better alumni pool in that period  —   I got lucky.’ ” Eventually, having replicated the test five times, Grant was confident that he had eliminated other explanations. It was almost as if the good feelings had bypassed the callers’ conscious cognitive processes and gone straight to a more subconscious source of motivation. They were more driven to succeed, even if they could not pinpoint the trigger for that drive. The study quickly raised Grant’s profile in his field, partly because it relied on hard data: dollars, as opposed to manager assessments or  . “I don’t know the last time there was a study in our field that had such striking results,” says Stuart Bunderson, a professor of organizational behavior at Washington University. “In terms of an intervention that has practical significance and moves the needle on employee behavior  —   you don’t see them that often. ” The intervention was also a manager’s dream: fast and practically free. Over the years, Grant has followed up that study with other experiments testing his theories about prosocial motivation  —   the desire to help others, independent of easily foreseeable payback. In one study, Grant put up two different signs at   stations in a hospital. One reminded doctors and nurses, “Hand hygiene prevents you from catching diseases” another read, “Hand hygiene prevents patients from catching diseases. ” Grant measured the amount of soap used at each station. Doctors and nurses at the station where the sign referred to their patients used 45 percent more soap or hand sanitizer. These studies, two of Grant’s best known, focus on typically worthy beneficiaries: needy students and vulnerable patients. But some of his other research makes the case that prosocial behavior is as applicable in corporate America as it is in a hospital or a university. “Think of it this way,” he said. “In corporate America, people do sometimes feel that the work they do isn’t meaningful. And contributing to   can be a substitute for that. ” Take, for example, Grant’s study of workers at Borders who contributed to an   fund managed by the staff, with Borders matching donated funds. The money was set aside for employees in need  —   someone facing a pregnancy that would put a strain on their finances, for example, or the funeral of a loved one. Interestingly, Grant found that it was not the beneficiaries who showed the most significant increase in their commitment to Borders it was the donors, even those who gave just a few dollars a week. Through interviews and questionnaires, Grant determined that “as a result of gratitude to the company for the opportunity to affirm a valued aspect of their identities, they developed stronger affective commitment to the company. ” The study is uplifting and troubling at the same time: even Grant acknowledges the possibility of corporations playing off their employees’ generous impulses, as a sop to compensate for other failings  —   poor pay or demeaning work. (After all, if the employees at Borders had better benefits and pay, they might not have needed the emergency fund.) Jerry Davis, a management professor who taught Grant at the University of Michigan and is generally a fan of his former student’s work, couldn’t help making a pointed critique about its inherent limits when they were on a panel together: “So you think those workers at the Apple factory in China would stop committing suicide if only we showed them someone who was incredibly happy with their iPhone?” Grant’s answer to these questions is academic: he tries to understand how these mechanisms function but does not necessarily advocate implementation. “I am also skeptical about the motivations of corporations,” he said. “My concern is ultimately for the success and   of people in organizations. To the extent that individual and group accomplishments and quality of work life contribute to profits, I’m happy, but that’s not my primary goal. ” For all his general interest in psychology, Grant doesn’t seem interested in digging too deeply into the origins of his own psyche. About his   desire to help, he says simply: “My mother has what she calls the   gene. Maybe I just inherited it. ” He grew up in the suburbs of Detroit, raised by a lawyer, his father, and a teacher, his mother. He was an upbeat boy, though socially awkward and burdened by numerous food allergies and strong aversions  —   to haircuts, to bluejeans, to chocolate. He felt things deeply those aversions were matched by equally consuming passions. An aspiring basketball player, he would not allow himself to go inside until he made 23 consecutive free throws, even if it meant missing dinner. (That he never made the   team is the one failure that still pains him.) On weekends, he played video games for so many consecutive hours  —   10 was not unusual  —   that his mother called the local paper to complain about what the paper called, in the subsequent article, “The Dark Side of Nintendo. ” Grant started significantly losing his hair in his 20s, as if his head were trying to keep pace with his overall precociousness. Now almost entirely bald, he has a striking, monklike look. Though he comes across as charming and agreeable, there are still traces of the awkward boy he says he once was, a hint of discomfort in the smile he gives a student he runs into unexpectedly, a longstanding dread of parties (“unless they like psychology or magic tricks, in which case I’d come alive,” he said). He is aware of his own introverted tendencies, and some of his research involves the strengths of introverts at work. For the most part, Grant has more than compensated for the shyness he felt growing up. Once phobic about speaking in public, he forced himself to lecture as much as he could as a graduate student, handing out feedback forms so he could methodically learn from his weaknesses. He developed strategies for socializing comfortably, even though, he said, “I feel uncomfortable when I’m in a situation and I don’t know what people want or expect of me. ” Giving, he eventually realized, was a reliable way of mediating social interactions. On the day I followed Grant as he hurried to his office hours at Wharton, I read something on his face that registered as more than just busyness he seemed anxious. I wondered whether Grant was driven by the desire to help or a deep fear of disappointing someone. “That is one astute observation!” Grant said when I asked him about that by  . (With Grant, every observation is an astute one.) Grant often starts his research with observations about himself  —   “” they call it in the field  —   and he had conducted a study trying to determine which of those two impulses was more motivating. The answer turned out to be a combination of the two. “Givers motivate themselves to avoid complacency by focusing on the benefits to others if they succeed and worrying about disappointing them if they fail,” Grant wrote. One of Grant’s roommates, he went on, once joked that he had a productive form of O. C. D. “He noticed that when I was anxious about something, I had a habit of throwing myself   into tasks in which I felt responsible to others,” he said. “A few days later, my mentor, Brian Little, sent me an article by Ian McGregor, one of his doctoral students, who studied ‘compensatory conviction’: anxiety in one domain motivates people to dive into passionate pursuit in another. It was one of those crystallizing moments that triggered a ‘Yes, I want to be a psychologist!’ reaction  —   I was fascinated by how closely his theory and findings mapped onto my own experience. ” It’s not hard to imagine a   interpretation of Adam Grant: that his generosity might have its roots in some kind of need  —   maybe a need he feels, even more than the rest of us, to be liked. Or perhaps that he is channeling his extreme ambition into a   form of achievement. Productive and happy, Grant could even be seen as a paradigm of Freud’s definition of mental health: aggression sublimated into work. But he has never put much stock in psychoanalysis  —   if the work is not   he’s skeptical. “I think a lot of it is baggage that goes back to Freud, and Freud would always say that whatever is going on with you can be traced back to something that happened early in childhood with your mother,” he told me, by phone, as he was driving to work one day. “You can either accept that or be in denial. You can’t win!” He would rather simply understand himself as someone who gets a lot out of giving, then harness that feeling, study it and see how the mechanisms involved can inspire others to succeed. One night Grant forwarded me a grateful   from a student whose life, the student said, changed because of some advice Grant gave her. I commented that most people would be thrilled to receive one note like that in a lifetime. “I get several dozen a week,” Grant said. He agreed to send some my way. That evening, at around 8:30, the   started coming  —   Thank you for our conversation the other day and for your genius. . . . I couldn’t have done this without you. . . . I cannot thank you enough for your time and insight. . . . I’m thrilled. And I have you to thank. . . . After the first 10, I was impressed when they kept arriving, I was surprised. On and on, until almost 11, my   kept pinging when I awoke the next morning, I saw that he had forwarded me 41   from the preceding week, each one of them numbered for my convenience. Was this compulsive behavior? “Not really,” Grant said. “I would see it as   and focused. ” He said the question had generated a new research idea for him: “How Prosocial Behavior Can Mitigate O. C. D. Tendencies. ” Grant’s book, incorporating several decades of   research on reciprocity, divides the world into three categories: givers, matchers and takers. Givers give without expectation of immediate gain they never seem too busy to help, share credit actively and mentor generously. Matchers go through life with a master chit list in mind, giving when they can see how they will get something of equal value back and to people who they think can help them. And takers seek to come out ahead in every exchange they manage up and are defensive about their turf. Most people surveyed fall into the matcher category  —   but givers, Grant says, are overrepresented at both ends of the spectrum of success: they are the doormats who go nowhere or burn out, and they are the stars whose giving motivates them or distinguishes them as leaders. Much of Grant’s book sets out to establish the difference between the givers who are exploited and those who end up as models of achievement. The most successful givers, Grant explains, are those who rate high in concern for others but also in  . And they are strategic in their giving  —   they give to other givers and matchers, so that their work has the maximum desired effect they are cautious about giving to takers they give in ways that reinforce their social ties and they consolidate their giving into chunks, so that the impact is intense enough to be gratifying. (Grant incorporates his field’s findings into his own life with methodical rigor: one reason he meets with students four and a half hours in one day rather than spreading it out over the week is that a study found that consolidating giving yields more happiness.) The studies are elaborate, the findings nuanced  —   but it is easy to walk away from the book forgetting the cautionary tales about people who give too much and remembering only the wash of stories about boundless generosity resulting in surprising rewards: a computer programmer who built a Web site at no cost for music fans (one of whom turns out to be an influential figure in Silicon Valley) a financial adviser who travels to take on a client thought to be impoverished (only to find that person sitting on a significant fortune) the writers who start out working free on a project for a friend (and somehow end up among the most successful in Hollywood). I had assumed that Grant, and the other examples of extreme givers in his book, were simply superhuman in one way or another  —   not only in the acute empathy that makes giving so rewarding for them but also in their unusual focus and stamina and   speed, traits that allow them to bend time and squeeze in more generosity than the rest of us. Grant, clearly, has some advantages beyond his propensity to help: more than one of his colleagues told me, for example, that when they cannot find the citation for a particular paper, they simply   Grant directly, who is more reliable than Google and almost as fast (his childhood friends called him Mr. Facts). But Grant believes that in terms of giving, we all have the same muscle it’s just that he and the other givers in his book have exercised it more. In “Give and Take,” he cites a study that found that most people lose physical strength after enduring a test of will, like resisting   cookies when they are hungry. Typically, the study’s subjects could squeeze a handgrip for only 25 seconds after an exercise in willpower. But one group distinguished itself, squeezing the grip for 35 seconds after the test of will. They were people who were on the giving end of the   scale. “By consistently overriding their selfish impulses in order to help others, they had strengthened their psychological muscles, to the point where using willpower for painful tasks was no longer exhausting,” writes Grant of the study, conducted by researchers at Northwestern University. It seems too simple to assume that Grant just happens to be capable of great discipline across all facets of his life all those exercises in will, he would argue, feed each other, with one making the others possible. I like to think I am a typically helpful person, but after reading Grant’s book, I found myself experimenting with being more proactive about it. I started ending   by encouraging people to let me know if I could help them in one way or another. I put more effort into answering random entreaties from students trying to place articles. I encouraged contacts seeking work or connections to see me as a resource. And I did notice that simply avoiding the mental lag of deciding whether to help or not was helpful. At a minimum, Grant’s example presents a   rule: Unless the person on the other end is a proven taker, just do it  —   collaborate, offer up, grant the favor. The first time I exchanged those   I usually felt good after the second exchange on a given topic, I thought perhaps I had done my duty. But I noticed that every offer of help I initiated or granted engendered four or five   at the end of which I sometimes felt surly and behind on my work  —   and then guilty for feeling that way. Worse, those exchanges often even ended with the person on the other end wanting to meet for coffee. Coffee! Now I struggled to find a way to say, gracefully, that there was no way I could meet for coffee  —   not this week or next or the week after that, because there are only so many hours in the day, and if I do not get home in time to make dinner, my children will dine on Pirate’s Booty and Smarties, which would not make me feel helpful or productive or good. Children. It must be said that in the middle of a national debate about flexible hours and telecommuting, there is precious little in Grant’s book about work and family balance. The division of labor in Grant’s own marriage is very traditional his wife, who has a degree in psychiatric nursing, does not work outside the home, devoting her time to the care of their two young daughters and their home. Grant would be an extraordinary giver under any circumstances but it can only help that he doesn’t have to worry about running to the grocery store or renewing the car registration. “Sometimes I tell him, ‘Adam  —   just say no,’ ” his wife, Allison, told me, referring to the hundreds of requests he gets every day. “But he can’t say no. That’s what he is. That’s his way. ” Grant is devoted to his family  —   he has dinner most nights at home and takes his daughter to a preschool activity on many afternoons. But he also works at least one full day on the weekend, as well as six evenings a week, often well past 11. Once, when Grant was asked to give a talk on productivity, he confessed to a mentor that for all his research, he was still not sure what he did that was any different from anyone else. It wasn’t exactly a mystery, his mentor told him: He worked more. “I made a commitment to talk about that more,” Grant said. He did not mean to suggest that everyone should work on weekends he wanted them to be aware that they were making a choice, maybe even one they felt good about. “The way I see it, I have several different roles,” he told me: teacher, scholar, adviser, friend, to name a few. “I’d be concerned if any of those roles took more of my time than my family. ” Grant, of course, has conducted a study investigating whether giving behaviors at work translate into happiness at home. He found that people who felt they had contributed to others’   at work did not always feel great at the end of the workday but they usually did by bedtime, especially if they had reflected about their contribution in the intervening hours. It turns out that bringing your work home with you can be beneficial after all  —   if you’re thinking about it the right way. A skeptic might read Grant’s book and conclude that extreme givers are just matchers who are in it, maybe even subconsciously, for the long run. Eventually, in ways that are predictable and unpredictable, the bounty returns to them. Grant’s giving instincts might be reflexive, but they do clearly contribute to his success. “The entire world feels like it owes him a favor  —   including me,” says Justin Berg, a doctoral candidate who studies creativity at Wharton and who has collaborated with Grant. “People rush at the opportunity to work with him. ” And one round of giving enables another: when Grant calls on a work contact and asks her to meet with an undergraduate seeking work, chances are that contact is more than happy to enable Grant’s favor, because she has already been the beneficiary of more than one from him herself. The path to success is filled with people helping to clear the way. From the point of creativity, Grant’s undiscriminating helpfulness also reaps professional benefits, Berg says. “The best ideas occur to people who are touching multiple worlds and domains. And in our field, he’s at the nexus of a lot of them. ” Because one study found that old friends and connections can be even more valuable as resources than current ones  —   because they intersect with different worlds and therefore have more fresh ideas  —   Grant has a tickler built into his calendar reminding him, once a month, to get in touch with a contact he likes but with whom he has temporarily lost touch. And he is highly efficient about his giving: he virtually never says no to the   favor, something that will help someone out  —   an introduction, a quick suggestion  —   but cost him very little, relative to impact. We were sitting in Grant’s office one afternoon talking about efficiency, when he said: “The truth is, I don’t care how many articles I publish or how many words I write. Productivity is an imperfect way of indexing how much I’m contributing, how I’m using my limited time to make the most difference. ” It wasn’t until I was transcribing the conversation a few days later that I realized that when he referred to his limited time, he wasn’t just talking about a busy schedule there was a more existential tug in the phrase. I brought it up with him by phone. “It’s the kind of thing I almost never talk about,” Grant said. “But my responsibility is to be open. ” Mortality, he said, was the one subject that gave him something like panic attacks. He had always felt that way, since he was a brainy, sensitive kid playing basketball in his driveway, staring at the sun, suddenly terrified of what would happen when it burned out. That was why he first wanted to be a scientist  —   before he realized biology bored him and he would never reinvent physics  —   so he could help figure out how to extend life, or at least design the spacecrafts that he is sure, even now, will take us to safer planets if this one runs dry. Mortality, he said, is “something I can’t fix. I can’t do anything with or about it. ” He can’t let himself think about it too much he has lost days at a time to his anxiety, “to the point that it’s the equivalent of extreme physical pain. ” It struck Grant as odd that no one had ever tried to figure how the awareness of death motivates people’s behavior at work, and in 2009, he published a paper trying to understand the link between mortality and productivity: “The Hot and Cool of Death Awareness at Work: Mortality Cues, Aging and   and Prosocial Motivations. ” The study walks the reader through the fascinating field of death awareness, which measures how people respond to reminders of death, like a news clip about a deadly car crash. When and how, he asked, does the prospect of death become relevant to employees at work? Grant argued that when people’s reactions to reminders of death are “hot”  —   anxious and panicked  —   those workers tend to withdraw. But when they are “cool”  —   more reflective, as in response to chronic reminders, the kinds, for example, firefighters face  —   those workers would be more likely to “reflect on the meaning of life and their potential contributions. ” Grant wrote the paper, in part, to try to sort out his own hot and cool feelings on the subject. Contemplating the meaning of life doesn’t make him want to relax and work less. “I always go back to William James,” he said. “ ‘The greatest use of a life is to spend it on something that will outlast it.’ A big part of it is being remembered. ” Besides, relaxing stresses him out. “For me, in my moments of idleness, I experience the most existential anxiety, so I like that every moment is scheduled, even when it’s having on my calendar that I’m going to watch a television show with my wife. It means my brain is engaged in other things, and it’s not going to be a terrifying evening. ” Grant would be the first to say that he is not purely altruistic  —   that pure altruism, giving without regard for one’s   perhaps does not even exist. When he writes those 100 student recommendations, he says, he gets the satisfaction of helping them succeed. But there are other happy byproducts of that work as well: he might end up the beneficiary of those students’ good will later on and possibly inspire them to try to do right by those who will eventually ask them for help. He will also have kept himself busy enough that he won’t have much time to spend agonizing over what happens when he can’t give anymore. As he left the office after one of our meetings, Grant headed for his car, carrying another gift of gratitude: a twiggy box filled with organic jellies and dried fruit from the Environmental Defense Fund, to which he had recently spoken about how to motivate their  . On the way to the garage, Grant told me the story of a time that someone asked quite a lot from him. “So I got an   out of the blue from a recent Ph. D. who wanted career advice,” Grant said. “And I spoke to him for a while on the phone  —   twice. But then, after that, he asks me if I could give him comments on his dissertation, and he sends me this thing that was like 300 pages long. It was one of those moments  —   yikes!” Grant did not know this academic and was not an expert on the subject. This, I thought, was the   last straw, an occasion when Grant not only said no but also perhaps found the request itself galling. Surely he did not shun his family, his students, his ultimate Frisbee game, his research and his   list of   requests for the hours that it would have taken him to analyze a   dissertation. Even Adam Grant must say no sometimes. Grant said that he rarely feels resentful of such requests. “It’s on me if I want to say no,” he said. “I own my guilt. ” He did decide that in this case, the time it would take to read the paper would be excessive  —   and that indulging the impulse to read it all would be tantamount, in the logic of Grant’s thinking, to letting himself down, flouting his own rules of efficient giving. “So I just skimmed it for the most important parts,” he said, and gave general feedback on those points. The author then reworked the paper completely and sent it back to Grant to read again. Grant, of course, complied. “And guess what?” Grant said, breaking out in a smile. “The paper was great!”"
"Trump: Solve National Debt By Making Economy ’Dynamic,’ Doing ’Right Job’ of Purchasing Drugs for Medicare - Breitbart","GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump proposed tackling the national debt by doing “the right job” purchasing drugs for Medicare and creating a “dynamic economy” on Friday’s “O’Reilly Factor” on the Fox News Channel.  When asked why the national debt was a problem, Trump said, “[W]e’re getting to be a   version of Greece. we never do cutting. we never do anything. you know, I saw a statistic the other day, the  —   we’re the biggest purchaser of drugs in the world. Drugs, to make people better, for Medicare, et cetera, et cetera. We buy drugs. we spend the same, practically, as if you’re going to go buy drugs on a counter  —   from a counter, we spend the same. we could have saved $300 billion a year if we did the right job with the purchasing just of drugs. This is one item. ” Trump was then questioned on how he would bring down the national debt. He responded, “We have a country with no growth. We have no growth. ” He later added, after host Bill O’Reilly cut in to ask how this bring down the debt, “[W]e’re going to create a dynamic economy again. We’re going to bring the jobs back from China, from Mexico, from Japan. ” O’Reilly again asked how this would bring down the debt, to which Trump answered, “Because the country is going to start growing, and we’ll be up to 4 and even 5% and when we do that, we pay it back so easily. It’s easy to pay it back. ” O’Reilly then asked Trump how it would be easy. Trump stated, “Because essentially, if you look at the country like a   corporation, or a losing corporation, right now we’re a losing corporation. We’re going to make it a   corporation. ” O’Reilly then said, “OK, but then you’re going to have to raise taxes to get more money in to pay down that debt. ” Trump responded, “The problem we have is our taxes are so high, that nobody can  —   everybody’s choking. ” O’Reilly then asked how even with more economic growth, he would pay down trillions of dollars in debt. Trump said, “[L]isten, the politicians have caused this problem. We’re going to make our country dynamic again. Now, companies, big companies like Pfizer, are leaving. they’re going to make it worse. They’re leaving. Many  —   it’s called corporate inversion. Many companies are leaving because the taxes are so high. We have to lower taxes, not raise taxes. ” He added, “[T]he country will be more dynamic. It’ll be a dynamic  —   we are going to create a dynamic economy, where real jobs are going to be pouring into the country, and we’ll have a country that’s sustainable. It’ll work, Bill. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"
The Pillow Cure - The New York Times,"My neck is killing me. Isn’t yours? My shoulder hurts, too. Not always the same one, but always in the morning. Herniated disks, spinal stenosis, bone spurs: It’s a mess in there. As for the shoulders, one gave out with a horrible popping noise in a yoga class a few years ago the cause of the other’s decay remains a (very dull) mystery. These were the afflictions that sent me pillow shopping last week, and for which, on one particularly frigid evening, Saroya   a sales associate at Hastens, the Swedish mattress company, prescribed what she called “a   pillow cocktail. ” Ms.   whose nickname is Soy, was not referring to the handful of Advil washed down with a Bud that would be my   palliative. It’s the relationship, she said, between my head, my bed and my pillow. I had come to Hastens first because it is the purveyor of the $100, 000 mattress, an artisanal object made from wool, horsetail hair, cotton and mohair. (Like condo sales topping $100 million, this number sets a benchmark for a certain kind of lunatic luxury purchase.) And I knew I would find a pillow there to elevate the whole category. For years, the standard pillow for those with neck issues has been a crudely formed foam number, which is about as sexy as the cervical collar that is its daytime mate. Orthopedic bedding is not a style you want to cleave to, at least not for any length of time. You can’t mask an orthopedic pillow in a   print from John Robshaw, and its    contours throw the armada of the “dressed bed” into disarray. Hastens Anatomical Pillow is an unlovely name for a pretty object. At least, it comes with a case made from the company’s signature    check. It is made of down and feathers, and shaped like a padded O, or a Leigh Bowery headdress (yes, I did stuff my head into it later). Inside the O is a pocket into which you slip a neck bolster, made from the same proportion  —   15 to 85 percent  —   of down to feathers. For side or back sleepers like me, the   of the pillow is designed to fit under your neck and support its natural curve. Ms.   had me unwrap myself from all my layers so she could see my neck, and led me gently to what she said was Hastens’s best seller, the 2000T ($38, 000). “This is a   bed,” she said, “that’s really great for side sleepers. ” Tucking the pillow under my head, she traced my spine from   to my hairline with her fingers to make sure it was straight. My shoulders unscrunched, my eyelids fluttered. Reader, I went home with a $330 pillow. • These are boom times for the luxury bedding business. Hastens has been expanding exponentially, having opened two new stores in Manhattan last year now there are four locations in the city where you can buy a mattress that costs more than your car, and another Hastens store is to open in two weeks in Greenwich, Conn. But entire fortunes are being made in pillows, too. Consider the success of the My Pillow founder, Michael J. Lindell, a   former cocaine addict and inventor whose    pillows, which sell for about $50, brought in more than $100 million in sales in 2012, according to The Star Tribune of Minneapolis. No doubt you’ve seen his infomercial. He, too, had neck issues. He, like you, would “  all night long like a guppy,” as he puts it, until he developed his patented pillow filler, a stew of interlocking foam chunks.’ ”There are a few data sets to roughly gauge the size of the market for a product that would address the   nexus. In 2012, according to a survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics, and made available by the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons last week, 14 percent of adult Americans said they had neck pain within a   period in 2010, another N. C. H. S. survey noted that there were more than 10 million visits to doctors’ offices for complaints related to neck pain.” ’As it turns out, said Dr. Robert Gotlin, director of orthopedic and sports rehabilitation at Mount Sinai Beth Israel, we are designed for failure. “The fact is, from age 25 on, this process of failure begins,” he continued cheerfully. “The analogy is this: You go to a bowling alley and you hold a bowling ball over your head, and what happens is your arms gets tired. Basically, your head is that   ball. And over time, two things happen: your muscles get sore and your disks wear out. Or you get arthritis. We’re all going to wind up with at least one of these conditions at the same time we are still holding up this   object. I, like you, would love to go to bed and wake up without feeling any pain. ” As far as pillows are concerned, he said: “The real answer is, there is no answer. Foam or any of these pillows with the divots, the cutout supports, these are marketing items that have their own research attached that supports their claims. The best advice is to just pick one that feels good. The pillow should basically be one that keeps your head over your shoulders. Rather than spend all this money on the fancy things, see what’s comfortable. That could be the cheapest one. ” • At the Clean Bedroom in Brooklyn Heights, which sells organic bedding (natural latex and     cotton sheets, for example, in beige tones) and   bedroom furniture like dressers made from sustainable maple from the parlor floor of a brownstone building, Luis Camejo was explaining the niceties of   pillows. He was trying to locate a   one for me. Grains are good for support, he said, and because millet is a smaller grain than buckwheat, it’s less noisy  —   less crunchy  —   if you move around when you sleep. But he was sold out of the millet, and so were his company’s six other stores. It turned out that the seamstress at Sachi Organics, which makes the pillows, had a pinched nerve and was a week behind on their orders. Now that’s kind of ironic. “I’m an English major,” Mr. Camejo said. “So I’m not sure of the correct meaning of irony. ” How does an English major get into the bedding business? “Craigslist,” he said, as he rang up a buckwheat pillow ($80) and a shredded organic rubber contour pillow covered in beige wool ($199). •   on Mercer Street, directly opposite Andre Balazs’s solemn, Jean   glass castle, is a Greek organic bedding store that sells mattresses made from layers of coconut fibers, seaweed, cotton, wool and natural rubber. You could probably eat them, if times were tough. The main precept here is a sort of D. I. Y. bed: mattresses and pillows are made from zippered pockets stuffed with plant materials you can add to or remove. I was put to bed with slippers, a glass of   orange juice and a hand towel that Alisha Hylton, director of sales for   North America, spread over the Sithon VIII pillow (names here are derived from Greek mythology).   makes 12 kinds of pillows in various architectural styles and fillings, and a computer program on an iPad helps you figure out the one for you. Ms. Hylton said she used to measure her customers’ necks and shoulder spans with a ruler until a small child broke it now she just eyeballs them. The Sithon VIII ($316) had a bolster and a central pouch filled with seaweed, rubber and eucalyptus leaves. It comes with a bottle of eucalyptus oil and squares of linen you dollop with oil, then stick in that central pouch. I wasn’t eager to sleep in a fog of eucalyptus  —   it was too medical an aroma for bed  —   so Ms. Hylton added another, plainer model, the Sithon I ($117). None of the bedding is returnable, but in Europe you can try  ’s beds and pillows free, said Mike Efmorfidis, the company’s chief executive officer, at a   stay at one of their hotels. “I can’t offer you that here,” he said. “But you can sign up to sleep in the suite downstairs. Though not right now, because it’s occupied. ” Someone is sleeping under us right now? “Ah, he’s up now, he just passed by,” Mr. Efmorfidis said. Siestas in the suite, Ms. Hylton added, come complete with pillows and fresh linens. Customers typically choose   or   sessions, she said. It is perhaps a sign of the times that you can now find a bed by the hour, and just sleep in it."
’Walking Dead’ enters political coalition-building phase," (CNN) The following contains spoilers about ”The Walking Dead’s” February 12 episode. After the first half of its season seemed to inordinately wallow in violence and brutality, ”The Walking Dead” appears to be entering a more political phase, devoted to building coalitions against a totalitarian regime. Of course, the kick off to the current flight of episodes, which aired Sunday, is all about   with different constituencies in preparation for war    about Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and his group seeking to convince other communities to join them in a battle against Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). So far, the appeals haven’t been very effective, but there were signs of discord within the ranks that suggest some are willing to enlist in the cause, even if that means going against their leaders. While first impressions of this latest hour might be that not much happened, the shift toward persuasion, as opposed to brute force, represents something of a welcome respite. It also reflected a return    even if it’s only temporary    to keeping Rick’s gang together, as opposed to scattering them about and featuring individual or pairs of characters in   episodes. Although ”The Walking Dead” remains a major hit, ratings for the show steadily declined throughout the fall, which some attributed to its escalating levels of violence. That’s probably a   read on the defections, since other factors    including the show’s age and a few   cliffhangers    no doubt played a part. Still, the drop was precipitous enough to suggest a sizable number of viewers were losing patience with the program. Producer Gale Anne Hurd also acknowledged that the creative team was sensitive to the criticism and had sought to ”tone it down” after the season premiere. Obviously, there’s a   element associated with the horror genre that some fans expect. At its best, though, ”The Walking Dead” is about human interaction, and a   society where lawlessness is the norm. Throughout its run, the show has been about a search for safety and security under that scenario, with the zombies receding further into the background as the most serious threat. To be fair, Rick and his posse can’t stay comfortably ensconced anywhere for too long. A series with zombies baked into its DNA can’t become a debating society. Yet if there’s a way to engineer what amounts to an inflight course correction, part of that requires rediscovering the show’s core characters and internal sense of community. The premiere felt like a modest, lurching step in that direction, after having let Negan (heard, but not seen, Sunday) essentially overwhelm the narrative, thanks to a mix of his dictatorial manner and Morgan’s magnetic presence. At times ”The Walking Dead” has deviated from the comics, but the current storyline appears to be heading toward a major, potentially bloody showdown with Negan and the Saviors. Even so, the writers would benefit from remembering what made so many viewers connect with the show on an emotional level, not merely a visceral one. Besides, if nothing else it was sort of nice to get through an hour with a bit more talk and less head bashing, for however long that lasts."
Virginia mayor will resign after meth-for-sex bust," (CNN) By day, Richard ”Scott” Silverthorne is mayor of Fairfax, Virginia, a wealthy Washington suburb of 22, 000 people. He’s also a substitute teacher in the county public schools. But, as police revealed Thursday, Silverthorne, 50, allegedly had a side gig: meth dealer.  Silverthorne was arrested and charged with felony distribution of methamphetamine and misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia, Fairfax County police said. He was delivered to the Fairfax County Adult Detention Center and was later released on his own recognizance, police spokeswoman Meg Hawkins said. Silverthorne will resign from his post on Thursday, the city announced on Monday. Silverthorne’s legal troubles began with a tip about methamphetamine distributor to Fairfax County police in late July. Investigators identified a person who was allegedly distributing methamphetamine via a website used to arrange casual sexual encounters between men, police said in a statement. An undercover detective created a profile on the site, police said. Soon, he was communicating via text message with a suspect, who offered ”methamphetamine for sexual encounters,” according to the statement. Police set up a group sex encounter with Silverthorne, who allegedly agreed to bring drugs, along with other men. On Thursday, the parties rendezvoused at the Crowne Plaza hotel in Tysons Corner, where the mayor was arrested. Two years of misfortune, For Silverthorne, whose father was mayor in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the arrest was just the latest episode in two years of misfortune. Last year, he was laid off from his recruitment job with the National Association of Manufacturers, the Washington Post reported. Silverthorne ended up filing for bankruptcy after owing about $58, 000 to creditors and a bank foreclosed on his house, the Post reported. He moved in with a friend. To make matters worse, an oncologist diagnosed Silverthorne with squamous cell carcinoma of the neck. After the mayor’s arrest Thursday, investigators said they closed in on his alleged suppliers. They arrested two men identified as Juan Jose Fernandez, 34, and Caustin Lee McLaughlin, 21, both of Maryland. Fernandez was charged with felony distribution of methamphetamine, felony possession with the intent to distribute methamphetamine, and misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia. McLaughlin, who allegedly resisted arrest and had to be subdued with a Taser, was charged with felony distribution of methamphetamine, felony obstruction of justice, and misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia, according to police. ”It’s been a terrible year for me,” the mayor told the Post in late December.

EXCLUSIVE - #NeverTrump Convention Rebels: We Don’t Need A Rule Change To Stop Trump - Breitbart,"A group of   Trump Republican delegates is making one final    stand at the Republican convention in Cleveland from July  . [The #NeverTrumpers are a mix of   Ted Cruz supporters and Republicans who backed Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, and other candidates. They want to stop Mr. Trump, the winner of the GOP primaries, by peeling off enough of his pledged delegates on the first ballot to keep him below a majority, which would force a second ballot.  Trump has 1, 542 delegates, which gives him 305 more delegates than the majority threshold of 1, 237, which he battled to cross during the primaries in order to stave off a Ted Cruz plot to wrest the nomination away from Trump on the second ballot. 95 of Trump’s delegates are already unbound, giving him 1, 447 pledged delegates  —   210 above the majority threshold. If enough delegates defect to keep Trump at 1, 236 or below, most pledged delegates are freed by state laws on the second ballot. Then Cruz  —   who handpicked many delegates even in states that went for Trump  —   could   the mix alongside Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan, John Kasich, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, and other options. Can the   pull it off? Can they really unbind delegates that are “pledged”? It all depends  —   ironically enough for politics  —   on the word “conscience. ” Who Are The Rebels? The   rebels include supporters of different losing Republican primary candidates, but the main operatives behind the rebellion are all linked to the man who tried to broker the convention a couple months ago by manipulating delegate elections in various states: Ted Cruz. Cruz suspended his campaign after the Indiana primary in early May but he still showed up to the Kentucky Derby’s “Millionaire’s Row” ahead of the Kentucky primary, where he came in a close second. But, it’s not just Cruzers. “We come from the Rubio side, for sure, the folks that are behind this website,” Rubio bundler James Lamb, spokesman for DelegateRevolt. com, told Breitbart News. “There are folks coming in from Ted Cruz, a few from Ben Carson, Jeb Bush,” Lamb says, calling his group “a broad support system” for the movement. Lamb said that schoolteacher Kendal Unruh and, seemingly more importantly, Cruz’s Colorado volunteer coordinator Regina Thomson “are behind the main portion of this movement. ” Both Unruh and Thomson represent the Colorado delegation, which along with Wisconsin was the epicenter of Stop Trump efforts during the primaries. Unruh and Thomson’s Free The Delegates group has been organizing the movement’s national conference calls to keep people up to date on what’s going on. Lamb says that the movement started in Colorado, but has sparked “  around the country. ” The Coloradans are joined in rebellion by New Jersey politician Steve Lonegan, the fierce Cruz supporter who ran against Cory Booker for Senate in 2013. Lonegan works for the   Courageous Conservatives PAC, which is fighting to free the delegates. The rebels also include Eric O’Keefe, the Wisconsin Club For Growth director who battled   efforts to crush his governor Scott Walker, and who adamantly supports Cruz. O’Keefe was a big supporter of Cruz’s efforts to contest the convention back in April, when Cruz was still running. O’Keefe is still pushing to dump Trump, but maintains that this is not a power play by Cruz himself. O’Keefe’s brother Kurt O’Keefe is the treasurer of the   Trusted Leadership PAC, which is still operating on leftover donor money even though Cruz dropped out in early May. Trusted Leadership PAC executive director Chip Roy, Cruz’s former chief of staff, told Breitbart News that his PAC is only working to influence the Republican platform and the convention rules for 2020, not for 2016, and that the PAC is not working to unbind delegates in favor of Cruz. “Trusted Leadership PAC is working with conservative grassroots delegates to ensure future Party rules reflect the interests of the grassroots over the establishment. The PAC has not engaged in any unbinding movement,” Roy told Breitbart News. Another name also comes up in conversations about this rebel movement: Ken Cuccinelli of Virginia. Cuccinelli, who lost to Terry McAuliffe for governor, is a big Cruz backer who was integrally involved in Cruz’s push to broker the convention. Cuccinelli is not on record supporting the current rebellion. Cuccinelli did not provide comment for this report by press time. Cruz’s Virginia campaign   Beau Correll filed the first lawsuit this past week to change Virginia state law to unbind pledged delegates and allow them to make a “conscience vote” on the first ballot. So there you have it: it started in Colorado and sprouted branches in Wisconsin, New Jersey, and Virginia, and could still grow elsewhere. The Colorado Republicans infamously suspended their open caucus system in this presidential race. Party insiders unanimously threw all of their delegates behind Cruz, prompting outrage and a protest at the state capitol by Trump supporters who demanded a  . Breitbart News reported that Boulder County GOP chairwoman Peg Cage witnessed enough errors in the Colorado process that she told other Republican officials that the Colorado caucus might have to be done over. Some Cruz supporters were actually pushing for a   fearing that the Convention would unseat the Colorado delegation due to the controversy. Unruh did not provide comment to Breitbart News for this report. If the Trump campaign still wants to unseat the Colorado delegation, now might be the time. When you say   do you mean actually letting the people vote? That would be almost, dare I say, democratic! https:  .   —   Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) April 26, 2016,  What Is The ‘Conscience Clause’? Unruh is pushing for the Convention’s Rules Committee to “affirm” the existence of a conscience clause that can unbind pledged delegates on the first ballot. “Mr. Chairman, we are calling on you to support a rule at the Republican National Convention which would reaffirm the longstanding principle that delegates to the GOP Convention can vote their conscience in the name of preserving the legacy of our party and our nation,” Unruh writes in an open letter to Convention chairman Paul Ryan. Unruh’s “affirmation” does not have enough support in the Rules Committee (it would need a majority of the Committee’s 112 members) to actually pass. But as Unruh maintains, she only needs a quarter of the Rules Committee to force her proposal onto the floor of the convention, where it would have to get 1, 237 delegates  —   a majority of all the delegates there  —   in order to pass. Again, this is highly unlikely. But it’s also good strategy. Such a floor vote would happen on the first day of the convention, before the rebels have a chance to convene in person to discuss their strategy. Forcing a vote like this onto the floor will make every delegate in Cleveland aware of the possibility to defeat Trump. And here’s an important part: some of the rebels don’t think that they actually need to change the rules at all. “There’s already justification for the conscience exemption,” Lamb said, noting that it’s been used before throughout history. Lamb points to the book “Unbound” by Curly Haugland and Sean Parnell, published by the   Citizens in Charge Foundation. Haugland is the Republican National Committeeman from North Dakota and a Rules Committee member who has long been expressing his view that there is no such thing as a “pledged” delegate. Haugland, who mingled around CPAC this year talking about delegates, thinks the whole primary process doesn’t matter. He’s not necessarily against Trump, and he’s not part of the rebel movement. He’s been making this point for years. It just so happens that the Dump Trumpers are finally citing his work. Haugland points to “Rule 38” in the current version of “The Rules of The Republican Party. ” The document was adopted at the convention in Tampa in 2012 and revised by the Republican National Committee as recently as August 2014. Here’s the text of “Rule No. 38” known as “The Unit Rule”: No delegate or alternate delegate shall be bound by any attempt of any state or Congressional district to impose the unit rule. A “unit rule” prohibited by this section means a rule or law under which a delegation at the national convention casts its entire vote as a unit as determined by a majority vote of the delegation. Haugland interprets this rule to mean that there is no such thing as a “pledged delegate,” and that for all intents and purposes the primaries don’t matter and no state laws can trump that. The rule was apparently known as Rule 13 until the George W. Bush convention in 2000, when it became Rule 38, according to Haugland’s book. Haugland traces “The Unit Rule” in the Republican Party back to the 1860 convention, where Abraham Lincoln famously won as an underdog by working the delegates. For Paul Ryan’s part, he said in an interview that he will not force delegates to vote against their conscience. “The last thing I would do is tell anybody to do something that is contrary to their conscience,” Ryan said in a recent interview. State laws are likely the greatest impediment to a “conscience vote,” assuming the Convention does not change its rules. Cruz campaign veteran Beau Correll’s lawsuit in Virginia challenges state law requiring delegates to remain pledged to the state’s primary winner on the first ballot. If Correll manages to win this lawsuit before Cleveland, the game could change significantly, at least in Virginia. But the lawsuit will likely drag on, and other states have similar laws that have yet to be challenged in court. Correll’s suit states: “The First Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees delegates to the Republican Party’s and Democratic Party’s national conventions the right to vote their conscience, free from government compulsion, when participating in the selection of their party’s presidential nominee. Nonetheless, Virginia law acts to strip them of that right, imposing criminal penalties on delegates who vote for anyone other than the primary winner on the first ballot at a national convention. That law cannot be sustained under the First Amendment or as a legitimate exercise of Virginia’s authority under the United States Constitution. ” To justify this “conscience” vote, #NeverTrumpers are going   Social Justice Warrior. #NeverTrump operative Tim Miller, communications director for Jeb Bush’s failed campaign and an outside Establishment supporter of the rebellion, said that Trump’s “frankly racist behavior” among other factors is enough to allow delegates to vote their “conscience. ” Lonegan’s Courageous Conservatives PAC also notes that “Donald J. Trump has accelerated the use of ethnic stereotypes in a pathetic attempt to appeal to bigotry” in its open petition to free the delegates. But if some delegates try to invoke the   conscience exemption without a formal Convention rule change, it could be political suicide for them  —   especially if they come from state parties outside of Colorado, Wisconsin, or Virginia. Crushing The Rebels, Trump’s de facto campaign manager Paul Manafort is aware of the plot and he’s preparing to destroy it, possibly with extreme prejudice. Manafort has deputized six campaign staffers to lead a team of 150 Trump operatives that will oversee the convention delegates. The Trump operatives will keep in regular contact with Trump’s pledged delegates leading up to the convention. Manafort’s team is positioning themselves as the good cops. New York   power broker Carl Paladino, who predicts a “war” if anything happens, is positioning himself as the bad cop, vowing to step into any contested convention situation with the full force of his political machine. Unruh’s “affirmation” rule change is unlikely to pass the Rules Committee, which houses Cruz supporters like Morton Blackwell who still don’t want to ruffle feathers and throw the convention into chaos. So the plot will live or die on whether the “conscience” vote is really able to be invoked, in defiance of state laws, on the first ballot. And, of course, how many delegates will actually do it? The rebels have yet to offer any solid evidence that they have enough delegates to keep Trump from 1, 237 on the first ballot. But the potential is certainly there. Will this convention be marked by “conscience votes,” by   by chaos on the floor, by   warfare, by a situation similar to the 1964 convention fight between the Establishment’s Nelson Rockefeller and the Conservative Insurgency’s Barry Goldwater? Five months since the Iowa caucus, the Republican Party and the conservative movement are still reeling from a primary season that pitted ideological brother against brother, interest group against interest group, in combat so divisive that the party may never fully heal. There were Conservative Movement Blacklists, local convention   a failed   plot, and a migration of   Republican figures from the party. Considering all that has happened, maybe Cleveland was always destined to play out this way."
Police Seize $1 Million of Super Drug from Home,"Pennsylvania State Police raided the home of Kerri Malloy on Wednesday after postal workers notified them of a delivered package that contained carfentanil, CBS Pittsburgh reported. [Carfentanil, a tranquilizer designed to put down   elephants, is 10, 000 times more potent than morphine and is 100 times more potent than fentanyl. A dose of carfentanil the size of a grain of sand is considered a lethal dose for a human being.  “It’s so dangerous that while our people are gathering evidence they have to be in full suits that you would see for the clandestine team,” said Public Relations Officer Stephen Limani. State police indicated that the 5 grams of carfentanil seized are enough to make 50, 000 stamp bags of heroin. At $20 per stamp bag, Limani said that 5 grams of carfentanil are enough to create $1 million of the product. “I would be shocked if this delivery did not end up killing a large quantity of people in our area,” Trooper Limani told reporters. In addition to the carfentanil, police also discovered a grow operation of 136 marijuana plants. Police confirmed that child and youth services are also involved in the case because a child was among those living in the home.

Silicon Valley had a meltdown because it couldn’t use Uber and Lyft at SXSW,"’  ’ ’     Last May, voters in Austin, Texas,  their city government’s hard     line on background checks for Uber and Lyft drivers. Both     companies exited the city immediately, putting     regular users of the   services in a fix —  and     leaving more than 10, 000 drivers high and dry.   ’ ’     What has happened since has been considered a       success story, as the absence of the Silicon Valley duopoly     made room for a  —  by August, 10 licensed   services     had registered drivers with the city. ”Austin is showing the     world that yes, there is life after Uber,” CNN     Money  on March 8.     ”And it’’s pretty good.”   ’ ’     And then came South by Southwest, which brings about 70, 000     people to downtown Austin each March. On Saturday evening,     outages hit the new taxi startups, and overwhelming demand     cascaded from one broken app to the next, leading to a       breakdown and conferencewide freakout.   ’ ’     And lo, the elites called out in one voice, and what they said     was: Where the hell is my Uber?   ’ ’     “Austin is broken without Uber or Lyft,” tweeted Ryan Hoover,     the founder of ProductHunt.   ’ ’ ’t’t’tNo purer example of the hedonic treadmill than watching rich dudes freak out about having to navigate a major American city without Uber.  ’ ’TechCrunch  up the view from     Silicon Valley. ”Austin definitely missed its chance to     prove that cities are ready to   without Uber     or Lyft,” a reporter wrote.   ’ ’     It was a convincing demonstration of how thoroughly Uber     and Lyft have pervaded the habits of   American     executives. According to Certify, a company that analyzes     business expenses, business travelers in the fourth quarter of     2016  more than half of all     ground transportation expenses, including rental cars, on Uber     alone. It has been only six years since Uber launched in San     Francisco, and already, its absence is like a phantom limb     making founders writhe in frustration. In this wholesale class     allegiance to a single transportation company, however, these     people are outliers. Only 15 percent of Americans     had ever used a   service as     of last year, according to .   ’ ’     The outrage is dumb: Cities don’t function so differently now,     by any metric, than they did before the   apps     debuted five years ago.   ’ ”     But it’s also pernicious. It also illustrates how a happy     reliance on Uber has blinded a whole group of influential     Americans to a real mobility crisis in the U. S. that is getting     worse, not better. For people without a car, the American city     hasn’t been fully functioning for more than 50 years. Recent     downtown improvements like streetcars and bike shares do little     to address the transportation challenge of job sprawl. Bus     ridership is plummeting nationwide; ridership on the     nation’s   heavy rail system has  by 14 percent.     For people who don’t drive, transportation networks are not     getting them where they need to go.

I tend to     think transit’s wounds are mostly  . But       takes advantage of those shortcomings, pitching itself to     regulators, investors, and consumers as a necessary patch for     ailing transportation networks.   ’ ’     And the outburst from SXSW reminds me that so many loud voices     don’t just not participate in that     conversation about general mobility improvements in cities,     they’re not even conscious of its existence. They think a city     like Austin could reach ”full function” with a handful of     multinational taxi companies. They didn’t even think to     complain about how Austin’s transit system has cut service in     recent years, and ridership has fallen along with it —  down an     astounding  in 2016.     Looking for a bus isn’t an instinct they have anymore.   ’ ’     It may be naïve, but I’d like to think that the culture of     armchair transit experts agitating for better service has some     incremental political effect in New York, creating a grassroots     knowledge that filters up and out through reporters and     political staffers.   ’ ”     I doubt the panelists of South by Southwest would ever have     been lining up for Cap Metro bus service, even if the     alternative was to call a taxi service. But would     it kill them to complain about it? Among large U. S. cities,     only San Juan lost more transit riders than Austin last year.     That’s a problem that the   at SXSW could turn     their attention to.   ” ’Last May, voters in Austin, Texas. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’"
Silicon Valley Techies Complain About ’Scraping By’ on Six-Figure Salaries - Breitbart,"Several Silicon Valley employees, including a software engineer for Twitter who made a $160, 000 salary, were mocked online after complaining about their living standards in an article for The Guardian. [In the article, entitled “Scraping by on six figures? Tech workers feel poor in Silicon Valley’s wealth bubble,” the employee complained that his   salary was “pretty bad” for the area.  “I didn’t become a software engineer to be trying to make ends meet,” proclaimed the employee. “Families are priced out of the market. ” “The biggest cost is his $3, 000 rent  —   which he said was ‘ultra cheap’ for the area  —   for a   house in San Francisco, where he lives with his wife and two kids,” reported The Guardian sympathetically. “He’d like a slightly bigger property, but finds himself competing with groups of twentysomethings happy to share accommodation while paying up to $2, 000 for a single room. ” “The prohibitive costs have displaced teachers, city workers, firefighters and other members of the middle class, not to mention   residents,” they continued. “Now techies, many of whom are among the highest 1% of earners, are complaining that they, too, are being priced out. ” The Guardian also covered other Silicon Valley employees in the piece who were earning “between $100, 000 and $700, 000 a year” but still allegedly had trouble “making ends meet. ” “One Apple employee was recently living in a Santa Cruz garage, using a compost bucket as a toilet. Another tech worker, enrolled in a coding bootcamp, described how he lived with 12 other engineers in a   apartment rented via Airbnb,” The Guardian reported. “It was $1, 100 for a fucking bunk bed and five people in the same room. One guy was living in a closet, paying $1, 400 for a ‘private room,’” one man complained, while a female employee added, “We make over $1m between us, but we can’t afford a house  …     This is part of where the American dream is not working out here. ” Several San Francisco residents mocked the employees for their complaints. “Scraping by in the Bay Area on a   salary sure must be difficult!” joked San Francisco Chronicle reporter Lizzie Johnson.

Horror Game ’Outlast 2’ No Longer Banned in Australia - Breitbart,"The Australian Classification Board has rescinded the effective ban on Outlast 2. [There is some confusion as to whether there were any changes to the game’s content to escape the ban, with different outlets are reporting that the game was altered in response to the ratings controversy, while others assert that the content of the game was “not altered in any way during resubmission.  The initial classification ruling stated: The computer game is classified RC in accordance with the National Classification Code, Computer Games Table, 1. (a) as computer games that “depict, express or otherwise deal with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that they offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults to the extent that they should not be classified. The ACB itself told IGN that “it is satisfied that the original version of the game that was refused classification has been modified to allow the game to be classified R18+” which suggests that the content was indeed edited. The changes appear to be global  —   that is, all versions of the horror adventure appear would have been altered in the same manner. The statement released to Press Start by Red Barrels made that much clear: The statement released to Press Start by Red Barrels doesn’t make it clear whether the game was censored or not but asserted that Outlast 2‘s content would be the same in every region it was released: Outlast 2 has been rated R18+ by the Classification Branch in Australia and will be released 26th April 2017. There will be only one version of Outlast 2 available worldwide. On a broader scale, the reclassification might also owe Australian senator David Leyonhjelm some credit, who told the Australian Classification Board to “leave gamers alone” after the original ban was handed down. He revealed that both politicians and public servants are restricted from accessing popular gaming websites, even though most “wouldn’t know the different between a ghoul and an alghoul. ” Leyonhjelm decried the fact that “the mere suggestion of an    encounter between a creature and a human character was enough to get it banned altogether by the Australian Classification Board,” asserting that Outlast 2, like   open world RPG The Witcher 3, takes place “in a fantasy world, full of kinds of creatures, both human and  . ” He capped his argument with a salient point: “How is is that adults are not trusted to make choices about video games, and yet they are allowed to vote?” He added, “video games do not hurt anybody, and the govermment Classification Board should leave gamers alone. ” It’s a surprising turn toward common sense, and a hopeful sign for the future of interactive entertainment. If Australian gamers are fortunate, Outlast 2‘s release represents the first step toward a gaming environment that isn’t hamstrung by government censorship.

Khizr Khan: Trump has a ’black soul’,"Washington (CNN) Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim US soldier slain in Iraq in 2004, said Sunday that Donald Trump has a ”black soul,” indicating he lacks empathy and compassion.  Khan told CNN’s Jim Acosta on ”State of the Union” that he hopes Trump’s family will ”teach him some empathy.” ”He is a black soul, and this is totally unfit for the leadership of this country,” Khan said. ”The love and affection that we have received affirms that our grief    that our experience in this country has been correct and positive. The world is receiving us like we have never seen. They have seen the blackness of his character, of his soul.” Khan moved into the national spotlight after he pulled out a pocket copy of the Constitution during his speech at the Democratic National Convention. He said Trump would have barred his Muslim family from entering the United States. Khan said Sunday Trump’s ”policy, his practices, do not reflect that he has any understanding of the basic, fundamental constitutional principles of this country.” 10 takeaways from the DNC, ”He talks about excluding people, disrespecting judges, the entire judicial system, immigrants, Muslim immigrants. These are divisive rhetoric that are totally against the basic constitutional principles,” he said.  He also said Trump lacks key traits that presidents need. ”Two things are absolutely necessary in any leader or any person who aspires, wishes, to be a leader. That is moral compass and second is empathy,” Khan said.  Khan called on House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to withdraw their support for Trump.  ”It is a moral obligation    history will not forgive them,” he said. ”This election will pass, but history will be written. The lack of moral courage with remain a burden on their souls.” He said those GOP leaders have a ”moral, ethical obligation to not worry about the votes but repudiate him withdraw the support. If they do not, I will continue to speak.” Both McConnell and Ryan issued statements Sunday afternoon praising Khan’s son and reasserting their opposition to Trump’s proposed temporary ban on Muslim immigration, but neither mentioned Trump. ”Captain Khan was an American hero, and like all Americans I’m grateful for the sacrifices that selfless young men like Capt. Khan and their families have made in the war on terror,” McConnell said. ”All Americans should value the patriotic service of the patriots who volunteer to selflessly defend us in the armed services. And as I have long made clear, I agree with the Khans and families across the country that a travel ban on all members of a religion is simply contrary to American values.” Ryan said: ”America’s greatness is built on the principles of liberty and preserved by the men and women who wear the uniform to defend it. As I have said on numerous occasions, a religious test for entering our country is not reflective of these fundamental values. I reject it. Many Muslim Americans have served valiantly in our military, and made the ultimate sacrifice. Captain Khan was one such brave example. His sacrifice    and that of Khizr and Ghazala Khan    always be honored. Period.” Trump to Khizr Khan: ’I’ve made a lot of sacrifices’ The weekend    drew a sharper response from Jeb Bush, one of Trump’s vanquished GOP primary rivals.  ”This is so incredibly disrespectful of a family that endured the ultimate sacrifice for our country,” the former Florida governor tweeted Sunday night.  Former President George W. Bush’s office, in a statement from a spokesman, echoed some of the Republican congressional leaders’ views. ”President Bush isn’t commenting on this presidential election. President Bush remains deeply grateful for the sacrifice of all Gold Star families, as we all should be. He thinks about them and prays for them each and every day.” Khan pushed back on Trump’s suggestion that his wife, who was also on stage at the DNC, was not allowed to speak. He said she has high blood pressure and didn’t want to speak for fear she wouldn’t be able to hold herself together discussing her Gold Star son on stage. ”For this candidate for presidency to not be aware of the respect of a Gold Star mother standing there, and he had to take that shot at her, this is height of ignorance,” Khan said. ”This is why I showed him (the) Constitution. Had he read that, he would know the status a Gold Star mother holds in this nation.”  Trump had first suggested Khan’s wife was not allowed to speak in an interview with The New York Times’ Maureen Dowd, saying: ”I’d like to hear his wife say something.” Then, he told Stephanopoulos, ”If you look at his wife, she was standing there, she had nothing to say, she probably    maybe she wasn’t allowed to have anything to say, you tell me.” Khizr Khan’s wife, Ghazala Khan, responded to Trump in a Washington Post   Sunday.  ”Walking onto the convention stage, with a huge picture of my son behind me, I could hardly control myself. What mother could? Donald Trump has children whom he loves. Does he really need to wonder why I did not speak?” she wrote.  ”Donald Trump said that maybe I wasn’t allowed to say anything. That is not true,” Ghazala Khan wrote. ”My husband asked me if I wanted to speak, but I told him I could not. My religion teaches me that all human beings are equal in God’s eyes. Husband and wife are part of each other you should love and respect each other so you can take care of the family.” Khizr Khan had also said in an interview with The Washington Post that Trump’s attack on his wife was ”typical of a person without a soul.” Get ready: The election in 100 days away, ”Emotionally and physically    she just couldn’t even stand there, and when we left, as soon as we got off camera, she just broke down,” Khan told the Post. ”And the people inside, the staff, were holding her, consoling her. She was just totally emotionally spent. Only those parents that have lost their son or daughter could imagine the pain that such a memory causes.” Trump, in a statement released Saturday by his campaign, called Capt. Khan ”a hero to our country and we should honor all who have made the ultimate sacrifice to keep our country safe.” But after Khan’s Sunday CNN interview, Trump tweeted: ”I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!” Earlier Sunday, he also tweeted: ”Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our ”leaders” to eradicate it!” Trump also pushed back on Khan’s   suggestion that he has ”sacrificed nothing and no one” in an interview with with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos aired Sunday on ”This Week.” ”I think I’ve made a lot of sacrifices. I work very, very hard,” Trump said. ”I’ve created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures. I’ve had tremendous success. I think I’ve done a lot.”  And on Sunday night Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, issued a statement praising Humayun Khan and explaining Trump’s policies. ”Donald Trump and I believe that Captain Humayun Khan is an American hero and his family, like all Gold Star families, should be cherished by every American,” Pence said. ”Captain Khan gave his life to defend our country in the global war on terror. Due to the disastrous decisions of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, a once stable Middle East has now been overrun by ISIS. This must not stand,” Pence added. ”By suspending immigration from countries that have been compromised by terrorism, rebuilding our military, defeating ISIS at its source and projecting strength on the global stage, we will reduce the likelihood that other American families will face the enduring heartbreak of the Khan family.” ”Donald Trump will support our military and their families and we will defeat the enemies of our freedom.” Hillary Clinton also weighed in on Trump’s Khan comments on Sunday in remarks to parishioners at the Imani Temple Ministries in Cleveland, Ohio.  ”Mr. Khan paid the ultimate sacrifice in his family, didn’t he? And what has he heard from Donald Trump? Nothing but insults, degrading comments about Muslims, a total misunderstanding of what made our country great religions freedom, religious liberty,” she said. Clinton added: ”I don’t begrudge anyone of any other faith or of no faith at all. But I do tremble before those who would scapegoat other Americans, who would insult people because of their religion, their ethnicity, their disability, that is just not how I was raised, that is not how I was taught in my church.”"
‘A Sense of Dread’ for Civil Servants Shaken by Trump Transition - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Across the vast federal bureaucracy, Donald J. Trump’s arrival in the White House has spread anxiety, frustration, fear and resistance among many of the two million nonpolitical civil servants who say they work for the public, not a particular president. At the Environmental Protection Agency, a group of scientists strategized this past week about how to   President Trump’s environmental orders without being fired. At the Treasury Department, civil servants are quietly gathering information about   protections as they polish their résumés. At the United States Digital Service  —   the youthful cadre of employees who left jobs at Google, Facebook or Microsoft to join the Obama administration  —   workers are debating how to stop Mr. Trump should he want to use the databases they made more efficient to target specific immigrant groups. “It’s almost a sense of dread, as in, what will happen to us,” said Gabrielle Martin, a trial lawyer and   veteran at the Denver office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where colleagues now share daily, grim predictions about the fate of their jobs under Mr. Trump’s leadership. “It’s like the movie music when the shark is coming,” Ms. Martin said, referring to “Jaws,” the 1975 thriller. “People are just wary  —   is the shark going to come up out of the water?” This article is based on interviews around the country with more than three dozen current and recently departed federal employees from the Internal Revenue Service the Pentagon the Environmental Protection Agency the Justice and Treasury Departments the Departments of Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, and Housing and Urban Development and other parts of the government. They reveal a federal work force that is more fundamentally shaken than usual by the uncertainties that follow a presidential transition from one party to the other. Federal workers are more likely to be Democrats, according to surveys. But partisanship and ideology explain only some of the intense feelings among workers, many of whom have seen Democrats and Republicans in the White House come and go. At bars after work, in employee break rooms, on conference calls and on social media networks, employees at agencies targeted for steep reductions fear for their jobs. They worry about Mr. Trump’s freeze on hiring and regulations, his pledge to reverse environmental protections, and his executive order shutting down immigration for refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Some federal workers welcome Mr. Trump’s promises to create new jobs, build infrastructure and lower taxes. Others say they are focusing on doing their jobs and trying not to be distracted by the political noise that surrounds them. Still others say they are struggling with the question of whether they want to work for a president with whom they so strongly disagree. “What do you do,” asked Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, if you work at a place where the leader “avowedly renounces the work of that agency?” “All of a sudden, you are faced with a real moral dilemma,” continued Mr. Connolly, whose district just outside Washington is home to thousands of federal workers. Federal workers watched with growing alarm last year as Mr. Trump waged a campaign filled with antigovernment bombast and then during a transition in which he recruited cabinet secretaries hostile to the agencies they lead. Now they wait in these chaotic early days of Mr. Trump’s presidency as he and his political advisers use executive orders to shred the policies and traditions the workers have championed. The intensity of feeling was already raw in late December, when members of the Digital Service gathered for drinks at the Laughing Man Tavern, a Washington bar, to say goodbye to Mikey Dickerson, their boss and the Google engineer first hired to rescue HealthCare. gov, the government’s Affordable Care Act website. Mr. Dickerson had recruited many of them to overhaul outdated government systems and databases, with the goal of helping President Barack Obama open the country’s doors to refugees, protect immigrants, aid veterans and improve health care. Now, he said, those who choose to stay will be building better tools for the agenda of Mr. Trump. “This is a crisis moment,” Mr. Dickerson told his staff that night, according to a rough transcript of his remarks. “The coalition that brought us all together for a while is broken, because the values that we have all prioritized differently are now pointing in different directions. ” Four days after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, two of Mr. Trump’s advisers  —   Reed Cordish and Chris Liddell  —   attended the Digital Service’s staff meeting. The pair, who are close to Jared Kushner, the president’s    told the nearly 100 staff members that their expertise was valued by the president Mr. Kushner Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist and others in the West Wing. The message was meant to provide reassurance. But several members of the team said it had the opposite effect. One employee who still works there said it was the moment she realized their combined technological prowess would be harnessed for a new purpose. “At that moment, when folks heard the name Steve Bannon, it was like a punch in the gut. It became so real,” said the employee, who declined to be identified for fear of reprisals. Career employees are particularly nervous at the E. P. A. which Mr. Trump repeatedly singled out for attack on the campaign trail, vowing at one point to “get rid of” the agency. On Monday, about 100 employees at the agency’s Chicago office, which oversees the enforcement of environmental regulations in five Midwestern states, used their lunch hour to protest the Senate’s confirmation of Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general, to lead the agency. Mr. Pruitt was a fierce critic of its mission under Mr. Obama. “I have been through several transitions, but I have never had or seen this level of alarm,” said Nicole Cantello, an E. P. A. lawyer in the Chicago office, who heads the   union of the agency’s employees. Ms. Cantello, who has worked for the E. P. A. prosecuting cases since 1990, said that during the George W. Bush administration, some career employees had quietly bristled at more   environmental regulations. But at no point did they feel the alarm they do now, she said. “Unless there’s an abject abandoning of E. P. A. ’s role in the world, we’ll do what we’re told to do,” she said. In a video to E. P. A. employees this past week, the acting administrator, Catherine R. McCabe, acknowledged that “many of you are concerned about” reports that climate change data had been removed from the department’s websites. “I would like to allay the fears and rumors that scientific data and information are being deleted,” she said. “That is not the case. ” Despite such reassurances, the concerns of federal employees are being spread across social media, on accounts with names like “@Rogue_DOD,” “@Alt_DeptofEd” and “@AngryWHStaffer. ” One anonymous Twitter user created “@WhitehouseLeaks,” with a purported mission to reveal the secret workings of the Trump administration from within the West Wing. Many federal employees recoiled at reports that the president was about to issue an executive order rolling back certain rights for lesbians, gays and transgender people. “There was a group of people who were planning some public display of protest with the purpose of leaving,” a federal employee in Washington said. Another official, who worked at Treasury until this past week, said his friends would have considered that order “the last straw” and most likely would have quit. The president did not issue such an order. Many government employees said they were inspired by the actions of Sally Q. Yates, a top   official in the Justice Department who was fired as  acting attorney general after she refused to order the department’s lawyers to defend the legality of Mr. Trump’s travel ban. More than 1, 000 State Department diplomats registered their opposition to the ban by signing a dissent letter asserting that the new policy would “run counter to core American values” and would not make the country safer. At the Defense Department, where uniformed men and women work with civilians, several    employees expressed outrage that Mr. Trump would announce the travel ban at the Pentagon, a building filled with people from different faiths and countries. That same day, the Defense Department posted a message on Twitter about a former refugee who became a Marine. “From refugee to #Marine. @USMC Cpl Ali J. Mohammed takes his fight to the doorstep of those who cast his family out,” it read."

The king with 100 wives," (CNN) Abumbi II, the 11th fon, or king, of Bafut, Cameroon, has close to 100 wives. They weren’t all his to start.  According to local tradition, when a fon dies, his successor inherits all his wives and then marries his own queens.  ”The queens have a great role to play in the fondom,” notes Prince Nickson, also of Bafut, noting that it is up to these women behind the man to shape him in his kingly role. ”Behind every successful man must be a very successful, staunch woman,” says Abumbi’s third wife, Queen Constance.  ”Our tradition has it that when you are king, the elderly wives remain to hand down the tradition to the younger wives, and also to teach the king the tradition because the king had been a prince, not a king.” Despite the fact that polygamy is legal in Cameroon, the data shows that there are far fewer polygamous marriages across the African continent. The practice is being challenged by changing values, the spread of the Christian faith, the growing appeal of the western way of life but also the rising costs of having large families. It is against this backdrop that Cameroon’s traditional rulers must walk the fine line between two often conflicting cultures.  ”During colonialism other values came in, of governance, different from the traditional values we had and therefore there is this constant conflict between the traditional values and modern western values,” admits Fon Abumbi II, who has ruled Bafut, the largest fondom in the region, for 47 years.    ”My role is to blend them, to find the way forward so my subjects can enjoy the fruits of development and modernity without destroying their culture.  Without a culture, you are not a human being, you are an animal. And therefore the chieftaincy institution is the guarantor of our culture.” Though polygamy is often met with criticism in the West, there are some who deem it a valuable tradition. After meeting with Fon Abumbi II, Soni Methu, presenter for CNN’s Inside Africa, noted that there was more to the practice than meets the eye:  ”I understand that we might be quick to judge the lifestyle of the kings, but just like in the United Kingdom, African kingdoms and kings are bound to a rich culture and history. (Practices) like inheritance of all your father’s wives is nothing but a moral obligation.”  She also observed that many of these royals are highly accomplished. On meeting the queens of Fon Ndofua Zofia II of Babungo    one of Cameroon’s youngest traditional rulers    Methu said: ”All his young wives, forced on him by tradition, spoke fluent English in a   region and were great marketers.”  It is this seeming contradiction that makes life in the fondom fascinating and confusing. Are they stuck in the past or keeping pace with the present? Fon Zofoa III doesn’t think you have to choose. He may have ”inherited” 72 wives and more than 500 children after his father’s death, but he considers himself a very modern king.  ”To run a kingdom nowadays in this era, you must be educated because things are moving very fast. Like they used to say, education is light, ignorance is darkness.” To meet the fon, or king, of Bafut, as well as his wives, watch the video below: Read more: Making blockbusters in a nation without cinemas.

"VIDEO: Armed Employee Sneaks up Behind Armed Suspect, Foils Robbery Attempt - Breitbart","An armed employee at Cleveland, Ohio’s Convenient Food Mart, crept up behind an armed suspect and foiled a robbery attempt. [The incident occurred in the Stockyards district around 10:45 pm Saturday.  According to Cleveland. com, the suspect,    Frederick Thornton, walked into the business wearing a surgical mask, pointed a gun at the    clerk, and demanded money. He allegedly became aggravated with the clerk’s pace and “smacked his gun against the register,” demanding the money be handed over quicker. Banging against the register and screaming at the clerk caused enough noise that a    working in the back of the store noticed the commotion, retrieved a handgun, and went out to intervene. The video shows the employee sneak up behind Thornton and put the gun against his back.  Thornton then spun around. The two began to wrestle for control of the guns. An employee came out from behind the counter, took away Thornton’s gun and fired warning shots into the air. Thornton then put his hands in the air at the sound of gunfire and asked the employees “not to shoot. ” While one employee held Thornton at gunpoint, the second armed employee ran outside to see if any accomplices were waiting on Thornton to exit the store. Police soon arrived, arrested Thornton, and charged him with “aggravated robbery. ” Store owner Haytham Mustafa expressed pride in the way his employees handled the situation. He said, “Thank God no one was hurt. They really handled it well. They didn’t go overboard and didn’t hurt anyone.

Tesla Passes Ford in Market Value as Investors Bet on the Future - The New York Times,"DETROIT  —   The record pace of auto sales in the United States is slowing down, leaving investors increasingly bearish on auto stocks. But there is one exception. Tesla, the   upstart, continues to surge. On Monday, Tesla surpassed Ford Motor in market value for the first time and moved within striking distance of General Motors, starkly illustrating the growing gap in investors’ optimism over its future versus the prospects for the traditional carmakers from Detroit. While G. M. and Ford may have strong profits and healthy balance sheets, Tesla offers something Wall Street loves much more: the potential for dramatic growth. “Investors want something that is going to go up in orders of magnitude in six months to six years, and Tesla is that story,” said Karl Brauer, a senior editor at Kelley Blue Book. “Nobody thinks Ford or G. M. is going to do that. ” Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, has shattered the conventional wisdom that automakers should be viewed as a stable, reliable investment. Instead, he promotes his   company as a dynamic vehicle for growth, despite the risks and challenges ahead of it. In his vision, Tesla is going to change the world, and is primed to cash in on the two transformative trends in the industry: the shift to electric vehicles as part of a broader societal move to cleaner energy, and the advent of automated driving. “Tesla is very vocal in talking about how they are positioned as we move from humans driving cars powered by gasoline to computers driving cars powered by batteries,” Mr. Brauer said. At the end of Monday’s trading, Tesla reached a market capitalization of $48. 7 billion compared with Ford’s $45. 6 billion, according to Bloomberg. General Motors was at $51. 2 billion. Tesla’s market milestone came at the intersection of two countervailing trends. On Sunday, Tesla said its   sales were up 69 percent from the same period a year ago. On Monday, monthly sales figures for the conventional automakers showed them struggling to meet last March’s performance. That sent stocks in the Detroit automakers down for the day  —   G. M. was off 3. 4 percent and Ford 1. 7 percent  —   while Tesla’s stock soared by more than 7 percent. Despite the recent boom years for the American motor industry, in which G. M. and Ford have been the biggest beneficiaries, executives are working overtime just to convince Wall Street that their business model can produce incremental improvements. Mr. Brauer said that reception was unfortunate for G. M. and Ford because “the reality is, they’re as financially healthy as they’ve ever been, and they’re in very good position for the future. ” Both companies have rebounded steadily since the recession, although G. M. needed a bankruptcy filing and $49 billion government bailout to recover. And both have taken advantage of the   consumer demand for new vehicles in recent years, especially for pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. But neither automaker has convinced Wall Street that it has shed its    reputation tied to broader economic cycles, or is at the forefront of new technology being developed for   vehicles and electric cars. The Detroit automakers are hardly sitting still in their efforts to improve current results and future prospects. G. M. made the momentous decision recently to sell its   European division, and Ford is adding jobs to accelerate its shift toward electric and autonomous vehicles. Both automakers have bought technology companies to bolster their   engineering expertise, and their executives have embraced the chance to work with the Trump administration on scaling back government regulations. All the same, both companies are ranked near the bottom in    ratios for the companies that make up the Standard  Poor’s 500 index. Last week, one of G. M.’s large investors, the hedge fund Greenlight Capital, proposed the creation of two classes of stock  —   one that strictly pays dividends, and a second tied directly to earnings and future growth in areas like   cars and   services. G. M. directors flatly rejected the idea as too risky, and the chief executive, Mary Barra, said there was no need to deviate from “executing a plan that is delivering record financial and operation results. ” Yet while industry analysts generally supported the decision, G. M.’s share price barely budged on the news that it was staying the course. And Monday’s data, showing total industry sales off 1. 6 percent, underscored that overall demand for new vehicles is slipping despite a bevy of discounts and incentives. G. M. showed a slight gain from the prior March, while Ford sales fell sharply. Several other automakers, such as Toyota, Fiat Chrysler and Hyundai, also reported declines. Of course, based on the number of cars actually being made, they are in a different league from Tesla. G. M. sold 256, 000 vehicles in the United States last month, and Ford 234, 000. Tesla’s sales for the same period: 4, 000. But it was the growth and the outlook, not the raw numbers, that moved the markets. Investors tend to look at Tesla as a technology   rather than an automaker. “It’s almost like Tesla is positioned in people’s minds as an energy storage company that happens to put most of its batteries on wheels,” said Andrew Stewart, chief investment officer at Exchange Capital Management, an investment firm in Ann Arbor, Mich. Tesla is also prone to more volatile stock movements because Mr. Musk and other board members and top executives own a large chunk of shares, leaving a relative few that change hands frequently, he said. “Whenever there’s interesting news, the people trying to buy are buying from a limited number of people who are willing to sell,” Mr. Stewart said. “While you have Ford and G. M. and they’re these     industrial companies. ” Because of Tesla’s acclaim and the limited number of shares being traded, the company draws more individual investors, and its share price tends to spike whenever Tesla or Mr. Musk makes news. This week’s jump in its stock price was set off by a brief news release on Sunday that said Tesla had delivered more than 25, 000 cars in the first quarter, exceeding analysts’ estimates. While Tesla may enjoy the favor of investors, it still faces some daunting hurdles to reach its goals. This summer, the company is supposed to start making the Model 3, a compact electric model that Tesla plans to sell for $35, 000 and produce in significantly higher volumes. It currently offers two vehicles, the Model S luxury sedan and the Model X S. U. V. both of which sell for $90, 000 or more when options are added in. (People who buy its cars benefit from a $7, 500 federal tax credit on environmentally friendly cars, a selling point with an uncertain future.) Once Tesla begins producing the Model 3, Mr. Musk expects production to ramp up quickly, with a goal of making 500, 000 cars a year by 2018. Achieving that target will not be easy, Mr. Brauer said. “That’s five times growth in volume,” he said. “I don’t know of any car company that’s ever done that in a   period. ”"
"Ralph Stanley, bluegrass music legend, dies at 89"," (CNN) Bluegrass music pioneer Ralph Stanley died Thursday at the age of 89, publicist Kirt Webster announced on Stanley’s official website. The ”patriarch of Appalachian music who with his brother Carter helped expand and popularize the genre that became known as bluegrass, died Thursday from difficulties with skin cancer,” Webster wrote. Stanley was already famous in bluegrass and roots music circles when the 2000 hit movie ”O Brother, Where Art Thou?” thrust him into the mainstream. He provided a haunting a cappella version of the dirge ”O Death” and ended up winning a Grammy. ”’O Brother’ has done wonders for me and anyone who plays this style,” Stanley told CNN in 2001. Stanley was born in Big Spraddle Creek, Virginia, in 1927 and grew up playing and listening to traditional mountain music, according to his biography on the International Bluegrass Music Museum website.  After World War II, he and his brother Carter formed the Stanley Brothers and their Clinch Mountain Boys and gained regional success playing for crowds mostly in the Appalachian Mountains.  Ralph played banjo and sang. After Carter’s death in 1966, he took on duties as front man for the groups, the IBMM said. In the 1960s, the Stanleys were exposed to new audiences on college campuses, in Europe and at music festivals, thanks to the folk music boom. His group was the first bluegrass band to play at the Newport Folk Festival, in 1959, the IBMM said. Ricky Skaggs and Keith Whitley were just two of the musicians who played in his band and later became   in their own right. Despite health problems, Webster said, Ralph Stanley ”continued to record and tour into his 80s, often performing with his son Ralph Stanley II on guitar and his grandson Nathan on mandolin.” Stanley was a member of the Bluegrass Hall of Fame and the Grand Ole Opry and was presented a ”Living Legend” award by the Library of Congress in 2000."

Afghanistan Forces Struggle to Hold Firm Against Taliban in South - The New York Times,"   Afghanistan  —   As Taliban fighters push toward the southern city of Lashkar Gah, members of Afghanistan’s elite forces are trying to hold their ground here, about 10 miles from the city, the capital of Helmand Province and a critical link in the defense of the entire region. The Afghan government’s need to rely on the special forces, highly trained for commando raids, to guard the perimeter of the city exposes a stark reality. As Helmand, the largest province in Afghanistan and the center of its opium production, endures intense enemy fire this summer, the regular police and army forces have failed to stand firm, raising the possibility that the Taliban could overrun Lashkar Gah. “The police, as soon as they were inflicted with some casualties, gave up about 27 posts one after another without a fight, and our posts were surrounded by surprise,” said Col. Nematullah Khalil, the commander of the Afghan Army’s Third Regiment, 215 Corps, whose soldiers are trying to help the special forces hold the line in    in the Nad Ali district. “The enemy planted a lot of mines wherever they reached, and that slows us down. ” Lt. Col. Mohammad Omar Jan, the police chief of the Nad Ali district, rejected that assessment. The army is blaming the police to cover up its own weakness, Colonel Jan said, adding that the army was responsible for   ’s security because his forces were busy trying to secure the district governor’s compound. “The police are fighting in the front line and suffer heavy casualties more than any other forces,” he said. In the scorching heat on the front lines near    members of regular police and army units looked tired on a recent day as they gathered in small clusters, resting in the shade of some buildings’ mud walls. The main road that separates the Afghan forces from the Taliban, who have been striking more forcefully and relentlessly this fighting season, is heavily mined. The   cornfields around the largely abandoned homes look calm, but at night the forces regularly clash with the Taliban. The troops have managed to retake only about a mile in the 10 days since they lost much of the    area, said Colonel Khalil, the Afghan Army officer. The entire area held by government forces in Helmand has shrunk in recent months. Four districts, including Musa Qala and Nawzad, that were the focus of thousands of American and coalition troops during the 2010 surge are under Taliban control. Frequent airstrikes and reinforcements are required to keep many of the other 10 districts, some only nominally in government control, from falling. While Afghan officials insist that Lashkar Gah will not be lost, their   strategy seems unsustainable against an enemy that has proved to be mobile and resilient. Defending the district centers that have not fallen to the Taliban has required a delegation of senior generals and officials from Kabul to shuttle back and forth to monitor developments. On Thursday morning, the senior generals led the fighting, pushing their ground troops and calling in strikes by Afghan and American aircraft to fend off Taliban advances on the district center of Nawa, just south of Lashkar Gah and one of the safest places in Helmand until recently. The Taliban fire, including mortar barrages, damaged the government buildings and demolished the watchtowers. On returning to Lashkar Gah, the generals remained in emergency mode, constantly on the line with troops in other districts, urging them to hold their ground. The Taliban fighters, many of them retreating from Nawa, shifted to exert pressure on the center of the neighboring district of Garmsir. The generals rallied some commandos and then piled into helicopters to save Garmsir. Another team was busy trying to clear the main road to Kandahar Province, which had remained blocked for a week because of Taliban mines and check posts, officials said. Sultan Muhammad, the police chief of Maiwand District, who participated in the road clearance, said that the authorities had defused as many as 100 roadside bombs, and that teams were continuing to clear more even as they were being engaged by the Taliban. Late on Sunday, the convoy of the provincial police chief, Gen. Aqa Noor Kentoz, struck a roadside bomb. The general and three of his guards were wounded, a spokesman for the provincial governor said. Why are the Afghan forces, who local security officials say outnumber the insurgents at least five to one and receive air support, struggling so badly in a strategic province? Helmand was a center of President Obama’s surge, in which tens of thousands of American and coalition troops were sent to try to secure the area, with hundreds of NATO military advisers still aiding the Afghans in the province. Some of the most senior members of the original Taliban are from Helmand, but they now operate from across the border in Pakistan, enabling them to move back and forth, often out of the reach of coalition forces. Beyond its symbolic value, Helmand remains a focus of their attacks not only because it is the gateway to other southern provinces, but also because its fields produce the highest amount of opium in Afghanistan and its vast deserts sit on the main opium trade route. Increasingly, the Taliban have come to resemble a drug cartel as much as an insurgency, relying heavily on the profits from the opium trade to fund their fight. Complicating the situation, officials in Helmand say, local strongmen are using their influence to plant their own men in provincial security jobs in outposts on the   route. Gen. Abdul Rahman Rahman, the deputy interior minister, said more than 90 percent of the police officers in Helmand were residents of the province and thus vulnerable to meddling and conflicting loyalties. For example, if a commander is replaced because of incompetence or abuse, security officials say, he is apt to take hundreds of his men with him, leaving a hole in the area’s defense. Political ties can also undermine security. When the brother of a powerful lawmaker who served as the security chief of the Garmsir district was fired recently over allegations that he was involved in the drug trade, the lawmaker organized protests in Lashkar Gah and Kabul. (One of the lawmaker’s nephews remains the head of counternarcotics in the province.) Moreover, military goals pale compared with the allure of financial gain. “The most important thing for the forces in Helmand is their own interests and business in the province  —   they are trying to get the amount of money which they have been told,” said Muhammad Jan Rasulyar, a former deputy governor of Helmand, referring to the widely held belief that commanders in lucrative posts pay   who help them get such jobs. “Differences between government authorities in Helmand made the Taliban stronger in the province, and this is the main reason for the increasing of conflicts. The authorities ward off each other instead of the enemy. ” The army itself has struggled to recover after suffering a record number of casualties in Helmand last year. Gen. Murad Ali Murad, the deputy chief of the army staff, said senior officers had tried to use the winter months to rebuild the 215 Corps. But the relentless pace of the fighting, in Helmand and in other parts of the country, derailed their efforts. New recruits with little experience were thrown into battle. “All of a sudden, the threats in Helmand increased and there was need for those forces to be used in the field, and we felt their deficiencies,” General Murad said. “We felt their lack of equipment and experience in the battlefield. ” Conversely, the Taliban seem to be growing in their actual fighting capability, or in their psychological hold over a struggling foe. Afghan commanders, security officials and   fighters say the insurgents are physically tough and use   goggles, snipers and sophisticated weapons. This phase of the war pits   insurgents who plant mines and then swiftly disappear against an armed force that is lured into traps while chasing the insurgents. This happens even as the soldiers are supported by aircraft that can rain down fire that makes the holding of any area costly for the Taliban. But more than anything, it is an uneven fight between insurgents prepared to attack and die, and soldiers who would flee to live. It is also a story told by the disparity in the unverified number of casualties provided by Helmand’s governor, Hayatullah Hayat. In the most recent two weeks of fighting, 210 Taliban fighters were killed and 40 were wounded, compared with 15 dead and 35 wounded for the Afghan forces, the governor said (though other local officials have suggested that the casualties to Afghan forces could be much higher)."
"Report: Identity of St. Cloud, Minnesota Mall Attacker Revealed as Dahir Adan, Say ’Leaders of Somali-American Community’ - Breitbart","UPDATE: Dahir Adan’s father, Ahmed Adan, says that police identified his son as the slain attacker. [Ahmed Adan told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis that police told him Saturday night that his son, Dahir A. Adan, died at Crossroads Center mall in St. Cloud. He says police didn’t mention the attack on the mall, but they seized photos and other materials from the family’s apartment. Authorities haven’t publicly identified the attacker. Minn. attacker was Dahir Adan, acc ro his dad, who said thru translator he born in Africa, lived in U. S. for 15yrs https:  .   —   Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) September 18, 2016,   The original story begins below: The Saint Cloud Times is reporting Dahir Adan, a member of the local Somali Community, was the man who attacked nine people at a local mall Saturday while shouting about “Allah. ” A short time earlier, St. Cloud   community members identified the deceased suspect as Dahir Adan. Leaders of the   community in St. Cloud gathered Sunday with his family and issued a statement of sympathy for the family and the nine victims of the attack. Community leader Abdul Kulane said as far as the family and community know, the suspect did not have any history of violence. He was known as a smart, accomplished student at Apollo High School. He was a junior at St. Cloud State University, Kulane said. Adan was also working   as a private security officer, leaders said. At a press conference on Sunday, St. Cloud, Minnesota city officials refused to release the identity of the man who attacked nine people with a knife in a local mall Saturday night while shouting “Allah. ” The attacker was killed by an   police officer from a nearby city who happened to be in the mall at the time. Mayor Dave Kleis of St. Cloud said that three of the victims were hospitalized, while six had not been hospitalized. Police Chief William Blair Anderson said that police had executed search warrants at two apartments in St. Cloud and had secured the suspect’s vehicle, which was found in the mall parking lot. Anderson also said the SCPD had had three “contacts” with the suspect, all of which were minor. At least one was a traffic incident. Anderson added that he did not know how long the suspect had been living in the St. Cloud community. The FBI     from Minneapolis said the FBI and the   Task Force were investigating the attack as a “potential” terrorism incident and was seeking the suspect’s immigration records. Mayor Kleis said the situation was “fluid. ” On Sunday, ISIS released a statement calling the attacker a “soldier of the Islamic state. ” According to the State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migrants interactive reporting website, 1, 061 Somali refugees have been resettled in St. Cloud in the six years since 2011, a pace that has accelerated over the past three years.   Somali refugees arrived in the Minnesota city  located seventy miles from Minneapolis in FY 2011,  and more than 200 per year have arrived in the four fiscal years since 2013. Only one other refugee from a different country of origin —  that one was from Burma, arrived during these six years. Across the state of Minnesota, 4, 995 Somali refugees arrived over this six year period. As the St. Cloud Times reported in 2015, tensions between the Somali refugees and local residents of St. Cloud have been high: Ethnic tension inside Technical High School became public spectacle Wednesday on its south lawn as more than 100 students and parents, most of them Somali, protested what they described as a pattern of bullying and discrimination to which school officials have not adequately responded. The protest started shortly before noon. Protesters, including students and parents, chanted slogans and waved posters. Inside the school, normal activity ground to a halt as the bulk of students not involved in the protest were contained to their classrooms. One of the protesters, Tech junior Hafsa Abdi, said students organized the event because administrators haven’t addressed conflicts between Somali and   students. Other protesters alleged unfair school disciplinary practices in which Somali students are disciplined more harshly than  . “They are not taking any calls right now,” a person who answered the phone at the St. Cloud Police Department tells Breitbart News about the department’s media representatives. Breitbart News also sent these questions by   to the St. Cloud Police Department, but has not received a response: Chief Anderson said at a Sunday press conference the department had three previous contacts with the attacker, so you obviously know his name. If you are not releasing his name now, when do you plan to release his name? Was the deceased attacker a resettled refugee? Was the deceased attacker a resettled refugee from Somalia? Was the deceased attacker a resettled refugee from Somalia residing in the St. Cloud community? Can you comment on the statement released by ISIS that the attacker was “a soldier of the Islamic state?” Local grassroots activists have been critical of the lack of information concerning the suspect’s identity, as well as local media reporting. “The reporting is so biased this morning a TV reporter on WCCO in Minneapolis interviewed an eyewitness who got close enough to identify the perpetrator without question. However, the description was edited down to a tall, thin male with a goatee!” a local grassroots activist tells Breitbart News. “A month ago, Governor Dayton was quick to visit St Cloud to tell critics of refugee resettlement that they should move to another state. Yet, the morning after mass stabbing a by what appears to be a Somali Muslim yelling ‘Allah’ the governor is nowhere to be found,” the activist adds. Back in 2015, Ann Corcoran of Refugee Resettlement Watch wrote, “Lutheran Social Service of Minnesota is responsible for the Somali chaos in St. Cloud. ” That supposedly ‘Christian’ charitable organization is directly responsible for the high Somali numbers in St. Cloud, and they are jointly responsible for bringing over ten thousand Somalis from around the world to colonize Minnesota towns in the last ten years alone —  Catholic Charities and World Relief MN (now Arrive Ministries) helped also. Corcoran added: A few years ago Saint Cloud, MN was targeted as a new Somali resettlement site by the US State Department and its contractor there —   Lutheran Social Service of Minnesota. Originally the Somalis there were what the refugee industry calls “secondary migrants” who move in from other areas of the state or from another state —  usually because they hear that an enclave of their kind of people is growing, sometimes for jobs, and sometimes for better welfare. St. Cloud’s Somali population is now growing as Somalis are arriving directly from hot spots around the world. (The direct resettlement by the Lutherans to St. Cloud began in around 2010.)"

This is the most WTF week in Washington in a long time," (CNN) Remember that time when former acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified in front of a Senate committee that she had warned White House counsel Don McGahn that national security adviser Michael Flynn was compromised by the Russians and was a potential blackmail target? That happened less than five days ago. This week in politics has seemed more like a month as stories    like the one involving Yates, Flynn and McGahn    that would have been MASSIVE news in a normal week are forgotten amid the next MASSIVE story to break. Walk down memory lane with me. And remember that all of these things have happened in the last 96 hours. Tuesday, May 9, The day is dominated by talk of why Trump didn’t fire Flynn for 18 days after Yates told McGahn about her concerns. Then, just before 6 p. m. ET, Trump fires FBI Director James Comey. Minutes later, CNN breaks the news that grand jury subpoenas have been delivered to associates of Flynn in connection with the ongoing FBI investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The White House communications shop goes into panic mode, with press secretary Sean Spicer’s         briefing as the  .  Wednesday, May 10, Vice President Mike Pence goes to Capitol Hill to argue that President Trump fired Comey because of a memo penned by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein arguing that Comey lost the confidence of the FBI with his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server. (Trump would directly contradict that assertion less than 24 hours later.) Then, Trump does a   with former Nixon Secretary of State Henry Kissinger even while comparisons of his firing of Comey to Nixon’s firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox in the infamous ”Saturday Night Massacre” swirl.  Later, pictures emerge of a smiling Trump shaking hands and laughing with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Yes, the same Kislyak at the center of the Flynn investigation. And the guy who Attorney General Jeff Sessions forgot he met with twice during the 2016 campaign, leading to his decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe. The White House later admits it was tricked by the Russians, who used the photos to troll Trump. Thursday, May 11  Two interviews with Trump    one in Time, the other in The Economist    come out in the morning. In the Time interview, Trump watches taped footage of the Yates hearing and offers biting commentary. In the Economist interview, Trump seems to claim he invented the phrase ”priming the pump.” Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe testifies in front of the Senate intelligence committee and directly contradicts repeated assertions by the Trump White House that Comey was disliked and distrusted by the rank and file at the FBI.   Trump sits for an interview with NBC’s Lester Holt in the afternoon, in which he insists he was going to fire Comey regardless of the Rosenstein memo    throwing two days of White House spin out the window    and acknowledges that Comey’s interest in the Russia investigation played a role in his dismissal. (The White House had repeatedly insisted the Russia investigation had nothing to do with Trump’s decision.) As a cherry on top of the day, Trump gets into a Twitter fight with comedian    and longtime nemesis    Rosie O’Donnell. Which brings us to the present. So far today, Trump has sent six early morning tweets in which he, among other things, threatened Comey to stay silent, floated the idea he might be taping conversations at the White House (Nixon, again!) argued that his staff can’t possibly be expected to tell the truth all the time and suggested canceling the daily press briefing. Trump’s lawyers also released a statement insisting that his last decade of tax returns do not show ”any income of any type from Russian sources.” They refused to release any of the documentation to back up that claim Trump has resisted releasing his tax returns for months, insisting they remain under audit. It makes me tired just writing it all. The pace at which the news moves in the Trump presidency is, literally, unheard of    the result of the   social media culture, Trump’s unpredictability, the level of interest (positive and negative) in everything and he does and, frankly, the long hours he keeps. It’s easy amid the barrage    and every week has been a maelstrom if not the Category 5 level of this week    to forget things that happened even a day or two ago.   Some of that is a concerted strategy on Trump’s part. If you throw 100 balls into the air every day, no one can catch them all. He has, throughout his life, shown a penchant for using a new headline (of his own making) to bump down a less favorable headline. He thinks and acts like a cable TV producer and he knows that whatever is freshest is what usually dominates. But there’s more here too. The pace at which Trump moves and acts    and tweets    often feels manic, as though he is playing right on the edge between strategic and totally out of control.   The events of this week seem to be firmly in the    space. Trump and his White House seem to be careening from one    disaster to another. There appears to be no consistent message, no consistent strategy and no real plan to get one.   The image that keeps coming to my mind is Trump, alone, angry and tweeting, while his staff runs around like chickens with their heads cut off trying to put out a fire    even as two more start behind them. Being unpredictable and unorthodox is one thing. Being totally out of control    a car with no brakes, a roller coaster car running out of track    is another. And Trump’s White House finds itself jammed into that car    with no clear sense of where they’re headed    right about now."
Ted Koppel to Sean Hannity: You Are ’Bad for America’ - Breitbart,"On this weekend’s broadcast of CBS’s “Sunday Morning” during a segment about the polarized media landscape in America, an exchange by CBS contributor Ted Koppel and Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity was featured that Koppel said Hannity was “bad for America. ”  Koppel suggested he was skeptical that the American public and more specifically Hannity’s viewers could differentiate an opinion show and a news show. He added that it was bad over the “long haul” because the audiences Hannity and others are reaching are more concerned with ideology than facts.

Plouffe on Trump: ’We Basically Have A Psychopath Running For President’ - Breitbart,"Sunday on NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe called Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump “a psychopath” in describing his run for president.  Plouffe  said, “I think the assessment was that Donald Trump would do some things to appeal to the middle of the electorate, to appeal to suburban college educated woman. He’s not. We basically have a psychopath running for president. I mean he meets the clinical definition. ” Host Chuck Todd pushed back, saying, “Wait a minute. Do you really think  —   diagnosing people on air and I assume you don’t have a degree in psychology, is that fair? I mean, we’re jumping to conclusions here. I think this is what gets voters frustrated with this kind of thing. ” Plouffe  added, “Listen. He  —   the grandiose notion of   pathological lying, lack of empathy and remorse. I think he does, right? I don’t have a degree in psychology but here is  —   Chuck, basically the race sits today. I think Hillary Clinton is guaranteed at least 269 electoral votes because Virginia and Colorado both campaigns are put away. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN"
"Trump may chill Obama’s warmer relations with Cuba, officials say","Havana, Cuba (CNN) President Donald Trump is expected to roll back portions of the Obama opening with Cuba as early as June, according to a US government official involved in the review of current US policy toward the   island. That official, as well as other current and former administration officials and Cuba experts, expect an announcement from Trump soon that the United States would no longer make unilateral concessions to Cuba    as critics accused the Obama administration of doing. They also expect that Trump will demand US fugitives of justice, such as Assata Shakur, who received political asylum on the island after being convicted of killing a New Jersey state trooper and escaping from a US prison, be extradited. And they believe the President will bar American companies from making deals with the Cuban military, which controls much of the   tourism industry. Trump is not expected to reverse all of Obama’s changes, which were seen as the most significant relaxation of tensions between the United States and Cuba since Fidel Castro’s 1959 revolution. But, current and former US officials say, Trump is looking to make a symbolic gesture that will fulfill his campaign promises to conservative   voters and   members of Congress without closing the door on Cuba’s emerging market for US businesses. ”I’m 1, 000 percent sure the President is going to deliver on his commitment,” Rep. Mario  .   who has lobbied the White House to reverse the Obama policy, told the National Journal in May. ”I have no doubt that you’re going to see in short order a different policy.” Cuban officials have refrained from direct comment. A White House official who did not want to be named said the administration is still considering what precise actions to take against Havana.  ”All of the suggestions in this article and more are on the table but none has been presented as yet to the President as of last night, but they are consistent with what he has said in the campaign,” the administration official said. ”Until he sees all the options before him    and none of us can speak for him    we do not know what he will decide in the end. You can take this administration’s actions on Venezuela as a guide.”  The Trump administration in May placed sanctions on eight members of Venezuela’s Supreme Court for stripping the country’s National Assembly of power, a move that was seen as contributing to the violent protests there. The sanctions prevent officials from traveling or doing business in the US and freeze any assets they may have abroad. The expected new policy in Cuba comes as Raul Castro appears to be finalizing his term as president. Castro has said he will step down in February 2018.  Although Castro is expected to hand pick his successor, the changing of the guard on the island would give the opportunity for the Trump administration to soon deal with a less polarizing figure if relations don’t significantly worsen. Before running for president, Trump had explored the possibility of opening hotels in Cuba. But on the campaign trail he took a much tougher line, threatening to cut diplomatic ties unless the government made concessions on human rights and religious freedoms. US officials said the administration was still looking at placing tighter controls on Americans visiting the island and possibly   a ban on US travelers bringing back Cuban cigars and rum, which was lifted by Obama. While the US prohibits tourism to Cuba, the US Treasury Department currently allows travelers to ” ” under 12 different categories of travel, such as educational tours and participating in sporting events. But the sources said Trump could end that practice, which has created a loophole that allows almost anyone to travel to the island legally.  Tightening up on those categories would likely impact earnings for the US airlines and cruise ship companies that began service to Cuba in 2016 and go against a rising   sanctions sentiment. In May, 55 US senators said they supported a bill to scrap the travel ban altogether. Trump also could overturn former President Barack Obama’s Presidential Policy Directive, which laid out general parameters for the US of a policy of engagement with Cuba. But sources said such a move would be largely cosmetic and would not have much impact.  Earlier this month, acting Assistant Secretary Francisco Palmieri, the State Department’s top diplomat for the Western Hemisphere, told reporters a focus of Trump’s revamped policy ”will be a high priority” to ensure that ”Cuba makes further substantive progress toward greater respect for human rights in the country.” For months, Cuban officials adopted a    attitude to Trump, with Raul Castro congratulating Trump on his electoral victory and saying he hoped to work with the new US president to continue to improve relations. But on May 20, considered by many Cubans in exile to be the island’s independence day, Trump issued a statement saying, ”The Cuban people deserve a government that peacefully upholds democratic values, economic liberties, religious freedoms, and human rights, and my Administration is committed to achieving that vision.” Later that day, a Cuban state broadcaster read a statement saying Trump’s views on Cuba were ”poorly advised” and ”clumsy.”"

He   said the reaction to the   was less than warm. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ”In a presidential campaign, and we’’ve seen a lot of them   and every one is defined as the most important one we’’ve had   in our history, but the fact of the matter is that goes on,” he   said. ”But this vote, by the current Congress of the United   States, is decided by the current makeup of the United States   Senate and the United States House.” ’ ’   ”I happen to believe  —   I don’’t want to try and project anyone   else’’s thinking  —   but this is a very serious matter,” he   continued. ”And when I see the presidential campaign going on,   it’’s almost a surreal   presidential election where if   you and I drafted a movie script about everything that was   happening on both sides with both candidates or even the whole   process, they would’’ve thrown us out of their offices out in   Hollywood because they would’’ve said this is a fiction that goes   beyond any fiction that would be acceptable.” ’ ’   Making note that he’’s ”never been” a strict ideological supporter   of free trade, Kasich said the agreement is ”a lot different than   NAFTA” because it involves China and Russia in a geopolitical   sense.  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   ”I think we’’ll work hard to try and pass it,” he said. ”The   strategy and the tactics, I don’’t know if they’’ve been developed   yet. And, let’’s be honest, the subject is hard to punch through   in the next six weeks.” ’ ’  ’ ’   Weaver said it will be absolutely necessary for Obama to use a   large amount of his political capital to get the deal through. If   not, ”it’’s not going to pass.” ’ ’   ”We have a carnival barker as a nominee on our side, and   Secretary Clinton has been pushed, unfortunately, she allowed   herself to be pushed by Bernie Sanders on the other,” Weaver   said. ”If the president will actually commit to working hard for   this, because it’’s not going to pass if he’’s not willing to use   political capital, and he now has a pretty high favorable rating   as he’’s getting ready to end his term, if he’’s willing to use   some of that political capital, we’’re willing to work with him to   get this done.” ’"

"Trump: Solve National Debt By Making Economy ’Dynamic,’ Doing ’Right Job’ of Purchasing Drugs for Medicare - Breitbart","GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump proposed tackling the national debt by doing “the right job” purchasing drugs for Medicare and creating a “dynamic economy” on Friday’s “O’Reilly Factor” on the Fox News Channel.  When asked why the national debt was a problem, Trump said, “[W]e’re getting to be a   version of Greece. we never do cutting. we never do anything. you know, I saw a statistic the other day, the  —   we’re the biggest purchaser of drugs in the world. Drugs, to make people better, for Medicare, et cetera, et cetera. We buy drugs. we spend the same, practically, as if you’re going to go buy drugs on a counter  —   from a counter, we spend the same. we could have saved $300 billion a year if we did the right job with the purchasing just of drugs. This is one item. ” Trump was then questioned on how he would bring down the national debt. He responded, “We have a country with no growth. We have no growth. ” He later added, after host Bill O’Reilly cut in to ask how this bring down the debt, “[W]e’re going to create a dynamic economy again. We’re going to bring the jobs back from China, from Mexico, from Japan. ” O’Reilly again asked how this would bring down the debt, to which Trump answered, “Because the country is going to start growing, and we’ll be up to 4 and even 5% and when we do that, we pay it back so easily. It’s easy to pay it back. ” O’Reilly then asked Trump how it would be easy. Trump stated, “Because essentially, if you look at the country like a   corporation, or a losing corporation, right now we’re a losing corporation. We’re going to make it a   corporation. ” O’Reilly then said, “OK, but then you’re going to have to raise taxes to get more money in to pay down that debt. ” Trump responded, “The problem we have is our taxes are so high, that nobody can  —   everybody’s choking. ” O’Reilly then asked how even with more economic growth, he would pay down trillions of dollars in debt. Trump said, “[L]isten, the politicians have caused this problem. We’re going to make our country dynamic again. Now, companies, big companies like Pfizer, are leaving. they’re going to make it worse. They’re leaving. Many  —   it’s called corporate inversion. Many companies are leaving because the taxes are so high. We have to lower taxes, not raise taxes. ” He added, “[T]he country will be more dynamic. It’ll be a dynamic  —   we are going to create a dynamic economy, where real jobs are going to be pouring into the country, and we’ll have a country that’s sustainable. It’ll work, Bill. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"
"Clinton, Trump make final pitches","Washington (CNN) President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama sought to lift Hillary Clinton to victory while Donald Trump warned she was the ”face of failure” and predicted he would blow her away in Tuesday’s election. On a dramatic final day of the ugliest campaign in modern history, the candidates and their surrogates held nearly two dozen rallies, chased one another through swing states and made desperate last pleas to voters.  2016 exit polls, Clinton won the tiny town of Dixville Notch, New Hampshire, as eight residents cast midnight ballots in an election day tradition. Four voted for Clinton, two backed Trump while one person supported Libertarian Gary Johnson and one person wrote in 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney. Clinton and Trump both go into Election Day with paths to the White House. But Clinton has many more options to secure the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Perhaps reflecting optimism, Clinton stressed national unity in her closing appearances Monday, while Trump returned to his claims that the political system and the media were rigged against him. 7 things to watch for on election night, The former secretary of state capped her campaign with a remarkable     rally with President Obama before a crowd of about 20, 000 against the symbolic backdrop of Independence Hall in Philadelphia. ”I regret deeply how angry the tone of the campaign became,” Clinton said, prompting one woman in the crowd to shout out, ”Not your fault!” But Clinton went on to slam the ”many troubling things” Trump had said about women, Muslims, Latinos and  . She said Trump’s ”most horrifying” comment was his warning that he may not accept the election result. ”Let’s show tomorrow there will be no question about the outcome of this election!” Clinton said. Obama introduced Clinton in a speech that was both a firm endorsement and a poignant farewell to politics. ”We now have the chance to elect a 45th president who will build on our progress who will finish the job . .. who is smart, who is steady and who is tested,” Obama said. ”She will work, she will deliver. She won’t just tweet.” Barack Obama’s frantic final campaign, The President said he was counting on Americans not to elect Trump. ”America, I am betting on you one more time,” Obama said, predicting the nation would ”reject fear” and choose hope. Michelle Obama, who has used her popularity to become perhaps Clinton’s most powerful surrogate, called on Democrats to turn out in huge numbers to prevent Trump becoming president. ”This election is on us. It is in our hands,” she said. ”If we get out and vote tomorrow, Hillary Clinton will win.” ’Face of failure’ Trump, meanwhile, presented himself as the face of change for Americans, whom he said had been let down by a corrupt political system. ”Hillary is the face of failure. She’s the face of failure,” Trump said, blasting Clinton’s political record and service as secretary of state. The Republican nominee claimed    in defiance of polls showing a   digit Clinton lead    that he was tied with his rival in Pennsylvania, a state that forms a crucial part of Clinton’s Democratic firewall. ”They say we’re tied in Pennsylvania. I don’t think so. I think we’re going to blow them out tomorrow. Blow them out,” Trump said at a rally in Scranton, one of the most hotly contested parts of the state. The latest CNN Poll of Polls gives Clinton a   lead over Trump, 46% to 42%. In most of the swing states that will decide, the race is tight. But if Clinton can hang on to most states that have voted Democratic in recent elections and add at most a couple of swing states, she will likely win the election. But Democrats are worried about Trump’s strength in the Midwest    particularly in Michigan, which has not voted Republican since 1988. Trump has been making a strong push there amid narrowing polls. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway predicted that Trump will win Michigan, telling ABC’s ”Good Morning America” that the campaign feels ”really good” about the latest polling in upper Midwest states. In final push, Trump’s aggressive campaign swing creeps past midnight, But Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said late visits to Michigan by both Clinton and Obama on Monday were more a function of the calendar and the lack of early voting there than a sign of genuine anxiety. ”Our strategy these last few days is to focus on the states where voting overwhelmingly happens on Election Day,” Mook said on CNN’s ”New Day.” ”Previously, as you’ve seen, we’ve been focused on states like Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, where the majority of the voting happens early.” He continued: ”So, this is really a reflection of the voting calendar. Donald Trump has been kind of running to each and every state it seems. So they have their strategy. But we have ours.” Trump scraps for every electoral vote, Trump has little margin for error. He will need to win Ohio, North Carolina and Florida, where he is locked in close races with Clinton, just to give him a chance to make the   run through the remaining swing states that he needs to capture the presidency. Democrats are particularly encouraged by indications of a surge of Hispanic voters in early voting in Florida and Nevada. But there also are warning signs for Clinton, with   not as large a proportion of the   electorate as they were for Obama in 2008 and 2012. CNN’s most recent electoral map shows Clinton is projected to win 268 electoral votes from states that are solidly blue or leaning in her direction. Trump has 204 votes from states that are solidly in his column or leaning that way. A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win the White House. GOP strategist: Clinton will win    but Congress won’t work with her, In the latest CNN Poll of Polls data in the swing states, Clinton leads 45% to 43% in North Carolina, the rivals are tied at 45% in Florida and Clinton leads by five points in Pennsylvania, a state Trump hopes to turn red. In New Hampshire, where the race moved toward Trump in the last week, Clinton is still up up 44% to 41%. New Hampshire only has four electoral votes, but Trump’s path to 270 is so difficult that votes from smaller states could still be crucial for him. The presidential election is not the only close race that will wrap up on Tuesday. Democrats are battling to grab back the Senate from Republicans. The GOP, meanwhile, is expected to hold onto the House of Representatives, but likely with a reduced majority. Speaker Paul Ryan said Monday that he would run again for the top job, despite reports in recent days that he may opt out or that more radical members of his restive caucus could try to oust him, after deeming him insufficiently supportive of Trump. ”I am going to stay    you know why? Because I moved our majority to put out a very specific and coherent agenda. We have it, we’re running on it,” Ryan said on the Charlie Sykes radio show. Asked who would win the presidential race, Ryan said he genuinely did not know, because ”it is such a weird election, such a volatile election.”"

Hillary Clinton: ’We Are Going To Follow The Money’ - Breitbart,"PHILADELPHIA  —   Hillary Clinton said that “We are going to follow the money” in her Democratic National Convention speech Thursday night. [Clinton was referring to getting money back into our country through foreign trade. But that   might as well refer to the revelations that Clinton and her husband Bill chased money all around the world  —   including money from corrupt foreign governments.  Clinton stole some of Donald Trump’s talking points, then inexplicably claimed that Trump never talked about those things. Clinton invited people who want to “say no to unfair trade deals [and to] stand up to China” to “join us. ” Before the campaign, she was a principal architect of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, while Trump has consistently opposed the deal. “If you believe we should expand Social Security,” Clinton said, which is something that Trump wants to do but Clinton herself has advocated in the past for a   “reform” plan. “You didn’t hear any of this from Donald Trump, did you, at his convention,” Clinton said. Actually, we did.  "
"Oscar-Winner Ellen Burstyn on Rise of Trump: After Obama, Now ’the Racists Get a Turn’ - Breitbart","Academy   actress Ellen Burstyn has “never seen anything” quite like this year’s presidential election season  —   and she believes she may know the reason for presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump’s extraordinary success. [“I can’t understand it,” the    Interstellar and Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore star said of Trump’s popularity in an interview with Deadline.  “The only thing I can think  —   and this is just a hypothesis I have nothing to base it on  —   is that the fact we elected a black president has excited an underlying racism, and it has come to the surface,” the actress added. “Now they’re saying, ‘OK, it’s our turn. The racists get a turn.’ I can’t imagine any other election year that there could be this ridiculous and overpowering support for that particular candidate. ” However, Burstyn  —   who joined the fourth season of Netflix’s political drama House of Cards this season  —   also said that the level of discourse between candidates on the other side of the ideological aisle is almost as bad as the Republicans. “For a while I thought we were looking pretty virtuous by comparison. But I’m afraid that’s degenerated now,” she told Deadline. “I just want to get them all together in a room and say, ‘Folks, we’re all human beings here. We’re all Americans. Could we just quiet down and have a little respect for the office, if not each other?’ It’s just so uncivil, and I don’t know what happened. ” In the fourth season of House of Cards, Burstyn plays the mother of First Lady Claire Underwood (Robin Wright). But the actress says the   drama playing out in this election season is crazier than anything the House of Cards showrunners could think up. “I’m just stunned,” she said. “That’s why it’s so important that we get either Hillary or Bernie into office. ” Burstyn  —   who won a Best Actress Oscar in 1975 for her role in Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore  —   has weighed in on presidential politics before, and recently. In 2012, she said during a television appearance that she found   nominee Mitt Romney “smarmy. ” “I don’t think [Romney] tells the truth. I think he makes stuff up,” the actress said then. “I daresay he lies. ” House of Cards Season 4 is currently streaming on Netflix.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum"
"Italy’s Populist 5-Star Party Prepares For Power, Holds Technology Summit","ROME (AP)  —   Italy’s     Movement is broadening its reach as it eyes national office, inviting some very establishment figures to a daylong summit Saturday on technology, science, jobs and the future. [The summit, which was intentionally low on political diatribe, marked a new phase for the grassroots protest movement that has upended the Italian political scene and now leads the polls as Italy prepares for a general election later this year or next.  And it provided strong evidence that the   are attracting more than just the   backers typical of Europe’s   parties. The head of Google Italy, university professors and prominent journalists took part, though there were notable absences, including among   lawmakers and Italy’s leading astronaut, who bailed at the last minute.   founder Beppe Grillo sat in the front row of the converted Olivetti typewriter factory in Ivrea, near Turin in northern Italy, watching as a next generation of   sympathizers outlined how Italy might emerge from years of economic stagnation and rising unemployment. Recent polls have put the   ahead of the ruling Democrats with some 32 percent of the vote. The movement blends an       agenda with a   friendly “direct democracy” ethos, where members pick candidates and platforms online. It has ruled out forming a coalition government and is hoping to reach the 40 percent of the vote threshold that would give it bonus seats in parliament. The party, though, has been divided of late by scandals engulfing its Rome mayor and Grillo himself, after he voided the candidate for mayor of Genoa who was chosen online and picked someone else instead. Saturday’s summit was preceded by the debut of a key    player of the   Movement, Davide Casaleggio. He is the son of Gianroberto Casaleggio, who   the movement with Grillo and was its political guru until his death last year. Davide Casaleggio made his first   TV appearance this week and was the brainchild behind Saturday’s summit, which was billed as a memorial to his father on the anniversary of his death.  "

Cuban Faces Deportation for Impersonating Border Patrol Agent,"A federal judge in south Texas handed down an   prison sentence to a Cuban national who posed as a U. S. Border Patrol agent.

Police: Remains of missing Arizona girl found," (CNN) An Arizona girl who disappeared from her home almost five years ago is dead, police in Tucson said Friday. The remains of Isabel Celis were discovered earlier this month during a search by authorities, Tucson Police Chief Chris Magnus said. ”This is not the ending that any of us hoped for but it is also not the ending of the case,” he said. Isabel was 6 when she disappeared from her Tuscon home in April 2012. She was last seen by family members when she went to bed at 11 p. m. on a Friday. When her father went to wake her at 8 a. m. Saturday    a   after her mother had gone to work    he said the girl was nowhere to be found, according to police. Police have followed 2, 200 leads in the case, which attracted national attention. No arrests have been announced and the chief would not discuss suspects at a news conference. The chief said Isabel’s remains were found in a rural part of Pima County, which includes Tucson. DNA from the remains was sent to a lab in Virginia, he said. ”Unfortunately, the results of this DNA analysis did confirm that the remains were those of Isabel Celis,” Magnus said.

Freed Chibok girls return home for Christmas,"Chibok, Nigeria (CNN) It was a journey they had waited nearly three long years to take. Ten weeks after being released by Boko Haram, 21 freed Chibok schoolgirls and a baby returned home this month to celebrate Christmas with their families for the first time since they were snatched by the terror group. The April 2014 kidnapping of nearly 300 girls from a boarding school in Chibok sparked global outrage a #BringBackOurGirls campaign on social media.  CNN accompanied the 21 girls as they made the journey from the capital Abuja, where they have been undergoing medical and psychological assessments since they were released by Boko Haram nearly two months ago in a deal brokered by an unnamed Swiss contingent and the Nigerian authorities. On Thursday, CNN’s Isha Sesay boarded a flight with the girls from Abuja to Yola in eastern Nigeria, where the girls would make a   road trip north to Chibok.  The change in the Chibok girls from 10 weeks earlier was remarkable. Their tattered clothes were gone and they were clearly better fed after surviving for two and a half years on meager or   meals. After their release in October, one of them, Glory Dama, told the assembled media that they once went without food for 40 days in the bush.  ”I did not know that a day like this will come, that we will be dancing and giving thanks to God among people,” she said. ”For one month and 10 days we stayed without food. I narrowly escaped a bomb blast in the forest.”  ’Beautiful and grateful’ Kidnapped as teenagers, the girls were now returning home as young women. They have been taking English classes and playing outdoors, their caretakers told CNN. One girl, Agnes, added that they have been learning how to knit. Several have had surgery to remove shrapnel. One of the girls, Rebecca Mallam, said they felt ”beautiful and grateful.”  The girls, Christians who were forcibly converted to Islam by their captors, prayed together before leaving Abuja Friday morning on the first leg of their journey home.  As they waited to board the flight to Yola they appeared tense. Their colorful clothes and bright smiles did little to mask the pain and anxiety behind their eyes.  Some of the girls had confided in their Abuja caretakers that they were worried about how they would be received by the wider community due to the stigma of being held by Boko Haram. Memories of that fateful April night were surely not far from their minds and one could only imagine the trauma they endured at the hands of their Boko Haram captors    one of the world’s deadliest terrorist groups.   However, there was a palpable sense of growing excitement Friday once they were on the move. They smiled more readily, giggling and chattering freely among themselves.  When asked how they were feeling about reuniting with family and friends in their hometown, they answered in unison: ”We are happy!”  After landing in Yola, they were welcomed by the governor and local community leaders. But the second half of their reunion journey was delayed as the road to Chibok was deemed too dangerous to travel at night.  So the girls gathered Friday night in their Yola hotel    surrounded by military guards    to pray and sing Christian hymns and songs. Their captors would have certainly not approved.  Watching them during these solemn acts of worship, it was not hard to see how they kept going through the worst moments of their ordeal with Boko Haram.  Home at last, At the crack of dawn Friday, the girls hit the road, accompanied by a military convoy that escorted them to Chibok. As we entered the town six hours later, we were greeted by a crowd of locals, many waving excitedly.  Parents and other family members were waiting anxiously to see their daughters again.  The moment of reunion finally arrived amid scenes of unbridled joy. Parents and daughters embraced, the pain and relief of the past two and a half years etched on their faces.  But then, suddenly we could hear wailing and   screams. Some mothers had come expecting to see their daughters, only to learn they were still being held by Boko Haram.  These women had thought their girls would be among the group coming home for Christmas. Their moment of hope gone, they remained inconsolable. There are 197 Chibok girls still in captivity, and talks are ongoing to free them. Sources tell CNN that negotiations only involve 83 of the girls. More joyful reunions like the ones we witnessed here may soon follow. But they may also be tempered by the grief of parents whose daughters are never coming home."
"After Outcry, Murder Charge Filed in Death of Former N.F.L. Player Joe McKnight - The New York Times","A grand jury indicted Ronald Gasser Jr. on Thursday in the fatal  shooting of the former N. F. L. player Joe McKnight, handing down a   murder charge. The charge is more severe than the one that Mr. Gasser had initially faced in December, when critics complained that racial bias may have affected the investigation. If convicted, Mr. Gasser, 54, would face life in prison with no parole. The death of Mr. McKnight, 28, a star running back at the University of Southern California who later played for the Jets and Kansas City Chiefs in the N. F. L. spurred several days of protests. Supporters and Mr. McKnight’s former teammates were outraged after the police initially freed Mr. Gasser. Though the authorities said Mr. Gasser had admitted to the shooting on Dec. 1, he was not arrested and charged until four days later. Mr. Gasser was initially charged with manslaughter over what the authorities described as a “road rage” confrontation in Terrytown, La. about five miles southeast of New Orleans. “Subsequent to that arrest, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office and the Jefferson Parish District Attorney’s Office continued working together in a collaborative effort to develop additional evidence regarding the case,” the district attorney’s office said in a statement Thursday. “Today’s indictment comes as a result of that joint effort. ” Mr. Gasser’s bond was also increased to $750, 000. The delayed arrest and lesser initial charge had angered critics, who said that Mr. Gasser, the owner of a telecommunications firm and a real estate business, may have been afforded more leeway because he is white, or that the authorities were less invested in swift justice for a black man’s death. In a fiery response after the initial arrest, Sheriff Newell Normand of Jefferson Parish defended the pace of the investigation, saying the authorities needed time to build a better case in a state that has strong Stand Your Ground   laws. Investigators conducted more than 160 interviews and spoke to Mr. Gasser for more than 12 hours, Sheriff Normand said at a news conference in December. “Justice has no time period,” he said. “Justice is not a sprint. It is a marathon. These investigations are marathons. ” The confrontation began around 2:45 p. m. after both men were driving erratically, cutting each other off and zipping in front of each other, Sheriff Normand said. Mr. Gasser became irate and engaged in a “verbal altercation” with Mr. McKnight, the sheriff said. When they stopped next to each other at a red light, Mr. McKnight got out of his car and approached the window of Mr. Gasser’s car, the sheriff said.

S. policy on transgender rights, raising concern   among rights advocates that Republican President Donald Trump is   about to revoke a signature initiative of his predecessor. ’ ”   Former Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration issued   guidance to public schools last May to allow transgender students   to use bathrooms matching their gender identity, a move   transgender people hailed as a civil rights victory. ” ’   Asked at a news briefing about concerns the government would   reverse the guidance, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer   said Trump believed the matter was an issue for the states to   decide, which is contrary to the Obama stance. ’ ’   ”All you have to do is look at what the president’’s view has been   for a long time, that this is not something that the federal   government should be involved in, that this is a states’’ rights   issue,” Spicer said, adding that the Justice and Education   departments would have ”further guidance” at an unspecified time. ’ ’   Legal advocates for transgender people say federal law and the   civil rights of Americans are legally enforced by the federal   government, as was born out during the civil rights movement of   the 1960s that led to legal equality for  . ’ ’’ ’   ”Enforcement of federal civil rights law is not a states’’ rights   issue. Full stop,” said Rachel Tiven, chief executive of Lambda   Legal, which defends lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender   (LGBT) people. ’ ”   The federal law in question, known as Title IX, bans sex   discrimination in education. But it remains unsettled whether   Title IX protections extend to a person’s gender identity. The   U. S. Supreme Court could settle the issue in a case due to be   argued in March. ” ”   Thirteen states led by Texas used a states’ rights defense in a   lawsuit against the Obama administration over its     guidance. That lawsuit would be rendered   moot if Trump to were to reverse the Obama policy. ” ’   (Reporting by Daniel Trotta; Editing by Jonathan Oatis) ’ ’(Reuters)  —   The White House on Tuesday. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’"
John Bolton: Putin Would Rather Face ‘Weak and Indecisive’ Clinton Than ‘Strong Figure’ like Trump,"Former U. N. Ambassador John Bolton, a senior fellow at the AEI Institute, joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Friday’s Breitbart News Daily to talk about former Secretary of State Colin Powell’s emails, which were exposed by a hacker and include colorful negative comments about Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, and Bill Clinton. [Bolton said the hack demonstrates that privacy is “very much at risk,” and that “people don’t think about what they’re putting down in their emails they think it will never be made public. ”  “Now we’re going to see the effect of that, and I just think it’s a despicable way to proceed. It’s like theft,” Bolton said. He added: That’s basically what it is. It’s why I’ve long thought, on the government side, that Edward Snowden was a reprehensible character, and so was Bradley Manning, and so are the people who are releasing these emails. Obviously, they’re interesting and fun to read, but they’re nobody’s business. What it says is that 99 percent of the people don’t have any protection on their email. Everybody’s vulnerable. “I worked for Colin Powell for four years at the State Department when he was secretary of state, so I think I know him well, and nothing really surprised me,” Bolton said of the leaked emails. “I think his opinions generally are  . I think some of the specificity, and some of the colorful rhetoric, may have surprised some people, but nothing really was that out of the ordinary. ” “That said, I’m sure it’s mortifying to him and to the correspondents that are part of these email chains, that they’re reading about what they said on the front pages of the newspapers,” he added. “That’s just never anything they contemplated, and it really does have, I think, a chilling effect on people who are used to using email. ” Bolton said he personally does not use email for that sort of discussion, but “for most people who think they write an email, and send it off, and they’re never gonna hear about it again, this is a   call. ” Turning to international news, Bolton said the   agreement in Syria between the United States and Russia is “something that demonstrates much of the futility of the Obama administration’s foreign policy”: Even if it holds, it will simply provide for some humanitarian relief around Aleppo. I don’t expect it to hold for very long. But it’s consumed an enormous amount of Secretary of State Kerry’s time, to deal with the Russians on an issue where we are fundamentally diverging from them, and has aroused intense opposition at the Pentagon.  I just think it shows the mistakes in the overall world view of the Obama administration. It simply can’t understand how countries can have interests adverse to the United States, and why we need to protect them.  My hope for the next four months, until the Obama administration goes out of office, is that the world just goes to sleep. That’s the best we can hope for because with his time in office dwindling down, I’m very worried that Obama and Kerry are going to be trying to build their legacy in an ideological way that’s gonna cause significant damage to the United States. Bolton said the media’s coverage of the two leading U. S. presidential candidates and their relationships with Russian President Vladimir Putin were examples of how the press tends to be “very superficial” about such matters: Look, we have interests that converge with Russia, in the case of certain elements of Islamic terrorism. We have interests that diverge, particularly on strategic weapons, and the overall global arrangement of things. The Obama administration’s gotten it completely wrong. They won’t cooperate with Russia on the bigger picture of terrorism, and they try and cut   agreements that end up entirely in Russia’s advantage. And I think that’s Hillary’s perspective. You know, people say the Russians are hacking into the DNC, and releasing documents to benefit Donald Trump. Let me give you a slightly different spin: they know Hillary Clinton very well, and they know that her foreign policy will be essentially the same as Obama’s  —   that she’s weak and indecisive when it comes to major decisions. And it could well be that what really is going on here is an effort to generate sympathy for her. Don’t underestimate how complex the Russian logic can be.  And I’m not at all sure that what we see between now and November, in the next seven weeks, is going to necessarily end up benefiting Trump, as the conventional wisdom has it. I think if I were Vladimir Putin, I’d rather deal with a weak American President than a strong American President, even as we look at the campaigns, with what Trump says about Putin. Putin has to understand he’s a strong figure, and that can cause trouble for Putin down the line.  Marlow observed that the media prefer all stories have clear heroes and villains, with straightforward    narratives, while international relations actually demand a good deal of nuance. “How come we’re not sophisticated enough to maybe think that there are some grey areas, on some parts of the world?” he asked. “I actually think the American people are a lot more sophisticated than many of their leaders  —   either political leaders, or the consultancy class in Washington or the media,” Bolton replied. “It’s one reason why I think there needs to be a lot more debate on national security issues, because the principal job of the president is dealing with international affairs. ” “If the country’s not safe, the domestic issues, in my view, all become secondary,” he said, adding: And yet, maybe we’ll see it in the debates. Maybe that’s where this discussion will take place, but I think people want to assess their leaders. They want to look at them and say, “There are going to be crises in the next four years we can’t even possibly predict at the moment, and what we are really assessing is the inner strength and character of the contenders for presidency. How will they do in a crisis situation?” The differences between George Bush on September the 11th, or Al Gore. Imagine what it would have been like with Al Gore. “The more we have the candidates compared on that basis, the better a decision, I think, the people can make,” Bolton said. Marlow noted that Clinton’s successor as secretary of state, John Kerry, had his own    scandal this week, with the revelation that “he was using his power in the State Department to shuffle taxpayer money to one of his daughter’s foundations. ” “I’m just stunned, but you know, I was stunned to learn of all the transactions between the Clinton Foundation and key donors, including foreign countries, and the State Department,” said Bolton. “In my experience at the State Department, if any political appointee did half of what we’ve read about here, they’d be fired, and probably prosecuted. ” “The double standard that’s been applied to the Clintons, maybe now to the Kerrys here  —   I’m without words to explain how frustrating it is that for normal people, at least normal Republicans, during the time I’ve been in government, what has gone on here would have been utterly unthinkable,” he declared. “If we expect this to continue, we are rapidly approaching a Third World kind of government. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.

Hillary Clinton Staffer Directed to Bypass Transportation Secretary’s Government Email Account,"NEW YORK  —   An email captured from John Podesta’s personal gmail email address has one Hillary Clinton campaign staffer directing another to bypass the government email address for Department of Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx and instead send campaign materials to Foxx’s private address. [In the email in question, released today by Wikileaks, Podesta’s chief of staff, Sara Latham, writes to another campaign staffer, Milia Fisher, asking her to send draft campaign materials specifically to Foxx’s personal account and not to his government email.  Latham also seems to ask Fisher to send the materials specifically from Podesta’s gmail account, implying the email should not come from Podesta’s campaign email address. Podesta is the chairman of Clinton’s campaign. Here is the text of the Jan 6, 2016 email from Latham: Milia, here are the 3 docs JDP wanted to send to Secy Foxx tonight if you want to tee up a draft email from his gmail to Foxx’s personal email not . gov, attach the docs etc  …    thx. JDP is a reference to John David Podesta.  His initials are commonly used in the published emails. Latham’s email further contains a draft message to Foxx from Podesta, written entirely in lowercase letters. The email makes clear the materials being sent to Foxx were campaign related: Secretary Foxx, really great to catch up earlier today, thanks again for your time next week. our Iowa team is ready to welcome you  —   pack some extra layers! as discussed I wanted to share our latest talking points on what’s at stake in this election, our policy paper on our infrastructure plan, and thought you may find it helpful to read Tom Perez’s speech from his trip to Iowa with Sec Clinton. don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or need anything further. best, John, Fisher replied, “Sure!” On January 11, five days after the email referencing the campaign’s Iowa team was sent, Foxx officially endorsed Clinton at a campaign event in Iowa.  He became the fourth Obama Cabinet member to back Clinton’s presidential bid. The emails from both Latham and Fisher were sent from their domains at Clinton’s campaign, @hillaryclinton. com. Podesta’s gmail account was copied in the exchanges. No explanation was provided for why the campaign staffer was asked to bypass Foxx’s government address. And there was no further explanation as to why the email should ostensibly be sent from Podesta’s gmail account, either.

Kerry denounces GOP letter to Iran leaders,"Washington (CNN) Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei joined top U. S. officials Thursday in blasting a letter 47 GOP senators recently sent on the Iran nuclear talks. Khamenei dismissed the letter as ”part of their ploys and tricks,” according to Iran’s official state outlet, Press TV. The senators, who are highly critical of the deal being worked out, wrote the Islamic Republic to warn its leaders of Congress’s role in approving and implementing any agreement. Khamenei’s comments came the day after Secretary of State John Kerry slammed the letter in a Senate hearing and said his reaction to it had been ”utter disbelief.” President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and other senior administration figures have also taken strong exception to the GOP move.  Khomenei’s barbs Thursday didn’t stop with the GOP senators, however, as he also lashed out at the world powers    Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China, as well as the U. S.    sitting across the negotiating table from Iran. ”Of course, I’m concerned because the other side is into deception, trickery and backstabbing,” Khamenei said, according to Press TV. Kerry, who has been heavily invested in the process and will meet with his Iranian counterpart next week as talks enter the homestretch ahead of the deadline for a framework agreement, defended the administration’s negotiating efforts at Wednesday’s Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. He told the panel that the Republican letter was a breach of ”more than two centuries of precedent” and factually incorrect. ”It purports to tell the world that if you want to have any confidence in your dealings with America, they have to negotiate with 535 members of Congress,” Kerry said. ”That is both untrue and a profoundly bad suggestion to make.” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut set Kerry up to address the letter, asking him to explain its impact, and Kerry took five minutes answering the question while glancing at what appeared to be prepared remarks. READ: Hillary Clinton blasts Cotton Iran letter, As he wrapped up, Sen. Bob Corker, the committee chairman and author of legislation that would require Congress to approve any deal with Iran, cut Kerry off, ending what the senator called ”a   speech.” ”This is not a speech,” Kerry insisted. But Corker again cut in and said Congress must weigh in on any deal with Iran, saying that he was ”very disappointed” with Kerry. Sen. Tom Cotton, a freshman Republican from Arkansas, penned the letter, which asserted that a lasting agreement would need congressional support. Cotton wasn’t shy about his attempts to undermine the Obama administration’s negotiations with Iran and said Tuesday the letter is ”about stopping Iran from getting a nuclear deal.” At the hearing, Kerry maintained that Cotton’s letter stemmed from the false premise that any agreement brokered with Iran would be legally binding, though the letter doesn’t use that language. ”We’re not negotiating a legally binding plan,” Kerry said, pointing out that an eventual agreement would have the same power as the ”thousands” of executive agreements between the U. S. and foreign countries that Congress has not approved. Kerry said that the letter is ”incorrect when it says that Congress could modify the terms of an agreement.” Sen. Jim Risch, a Republican who signed the letter, countered Kerry’s statement. ”This indignation and   over this letter is absolute nonsense,” he said. READ: Did 47 Republican senators break the law in plain sight? Risch said the ”problem we’ve got here is we have a real disagreement,” adding that the deal should be considered a treaty, not an executive agreement. A treaty requires the approval of   of the Senate. But he added, ”I hope an agreement is reached. I really hope we get a good agreement.” Sen. Rand Paul also knocked Kerry and the Obama administration, asserting that he signed on to the letter to send a message to the White House    a White House Paul asserted has repeatedly overstepped its authority with executive actions. ”The message I was sending was to you. The message was to President Obama that we want you to obey the law, we want you to understand the separation of powers,” the Kentucky Republican said. ”The letter was to Iran but it should have been CC’d to the White House.”"
Man with Bionic Penis Reportedly Flooded with Sex Offers - Breitbart,"A man with a bionic penis claims to have received dozens of messages from women eager to have sexual intercourse with him. [Mohammed Abar, 44, lost his sex organ in an accident when he was younger. However, he recently had a bionic penis installed and claims he has been inundated with over 50 messages from women eager to experience his  prosthetic manhood.  “I get a lot of messages from women online who ask me if I will have sex with them,” he said. “They’ve heard about my bionic penis and they want to try it out. They are all very intrigued and think I can make love for hours,” he continued. “It’s not that I don’t want to and I get offers, but I have been so busy with work. I work   shifts every day and by the time I get home I’m just too tired for sex,” he said. Unfortunately for Mohammed, he will not be able to have children, despite his bionic penis, after attempts during the operation to extract his sperm failed. However he could soon be tying the knot permanently, after he revealed his parents are looking to organise an arranged marriage. “We’re speaking to a few parties at the moment. I don’t care what she looks like, she could be tall, short, thin or fat. I prefer personality to looks. My parents will find me a suitable match,” he added.

Report: Paul Ryan’s Plan Could Force 15 Million People to Lose Health Coverage,"Analysis from the Brookings Institution says that 15 million people could lose coverage under Speaker Paul Ryan’s American Health Care Act. [The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has yet to score the Ryan plan, although the Brookings Institution’s report does not bode well for the House leadership’s bill.  The Ryan plan reports, “We conclude that CBO’s analysis will likely estimate that at least 15 million people will lose coverage under the American Health Care Act (AHCA) by the end of the   scoring window. Estimates could be higher, but it’s [sic] is unlikely they will be significantly lower. ” The Kaiser Family Foundation states that the Ryan plan’s tax credits aid wealthier Americans more than   individuals. Older Americans would face comparatively less aid through tax credits than younger counterparts. American Medical Association CEO James Madara also criticized the Republican leadership’s tax credits, saying, “We believe credits inversely related to income, rather than age as proposed in the committee’s legislation, not only result in greater numbers of people insured but are a more efficient use of   resources. ” Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady ( ) has maintained that tax credits help everyone get covered. He said, “It covers more people, because it applies to those who don’t have a tax liability, and it’s advanceable, so it’s available today. ” Avik Roy, a health expert at Forbes, argued that tax credits in the Ryan plan will “price many poor and vulnerable people out of the health insurance market. ” Michael Cannon, the Cato Institute’s director of health policy studies, believes that the GOP’s Obamacare replacement bill will force the poor to lose their coverage. He lamented, “If the tax credits (read: subsidies) for   Americans are less than under Obamacare, many more   patients will lose coverage. Premiums will continue to rise. Republicans will take the blame for all of it, because they will have failed to repeal Obamacare, or learn its lessons, when they had the chance. ”"
Voter-Outreach Campaigns in South Carolina May Decide Race - Breitbart,"The highly competitive   run by the top four GOP presidential contenders in the   South Carolina Republican primary may decide the outcome of the brutal fight in the Palmetto State. [Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz, Sen. Marco Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush all have jammed schedules of appearances,   and speeches to help persuade the many   voters, plus organized networks of volunteers who are trying to persuade and then motivate their supporters to vote during the Saturday ballot.  The two remaining candidates, John Kasich and Dr. Ben Carson, have little in the way of local infrastructure and have largely stayed away from the verbal fisticuffs. The release today of the   poll that shows Trump’s lead has dropped to 5 points suggests that the blowout victory many have been predicting is not as certain as previously thought, even though that poll is possibly an outlier. Unlike in Iowa, where Ted Cruz dominated the ground game, both the Trump campaign and the Bush campaign are mounting an aggressive South Carolina ground game. Rubio, likewise, has a ground game, though not apparently as robust as the other contenders. Add to this the unusual participation of several Super PACs which have endorsed Ted Cruz in the ground game wars, and the possibility of   swings in voter support are increased. Donald Trump had no ground game in Iowa, where he relied almost exclusively on massive public rallies to get out his vote. Cruz’s comparative advantage in the ground game there was one of the major factors that led to his victory there, contrary to the last polls which showed Trump in the lead. Cruz spent a year developing a ground game in Iowa, relying on local evangelicals, home schoolers, and at least 700 Texans who drove up on their own dime, stayed at “Camp Cruz,” and zealously knocked door to door for their candidate. Cruz’s father, Rafael Cruz, an evangelical Christian pastor, worked tirelessly among Iowa pastors to promote his son’s candidacy for many months before the caucuses. Though Trump claimed he improved his ground game in New Hampshire and that contributed to his big victory there, the changes in his political strategy there were more an increased scheduling of traditional small “retail politics” appearances rather than the installation of a quickly assembled ground game apparatus. But South Carolina is a different story for Trump. As former Trump consultant Roger Stone noted recently on Fox News, the Trump ground campaign is being run be proteges of the Lee Atwater, the late South Carolina hardball GOP political consultant who helped George H. W. Bush win the presidency in 1988. Trump volunteers are now being besieged with emails from the South Carolina team encouraging them to make 25 phone calls or knock on 25 doors in South Carolina. They’re using     easily downloaded applications on their computers and mobile devices to identify potential swing voters. Ground games are not glamorous, but they are necessary for electoral success in most political campaigns. They largely consist of    canvassing of likely voters by volunteer or paid canvassers. Each front door encounter between a potential voter and a canvasser should take between 3 to 5 minutes, during which time the canvasser provides the voter both verbally and in written form (via a brochure, usually) with key information about why the voter should support the candidate the canvasser supports. Often, the canvasser elicits information from the voter about their views. In today’s ground game, the data obtained during this brief engagement between canvasser and voter is captured immediately in the canvasser’s mobile device —  either a smart phone or a tablet —  and entered into the campaign’s database for future use. In only about 20 percent of the time does a canvasser actually have a conversation with the voter at the residence where they are door knocking. The remaining 80 percent of the time, the canvasser merely leaves campaign literature about their candidate on the voter’s door. It is during those brief    conversations that occur 20 percent of the time that the most significant changes in voter behavior occur. All the latest political science research  —   data which the Ted Cruz campaign leads in obtaining and using —  confirms that these    encounters are by far the most effective methods to change a voter’s mind in support of your candidate, or to   his or her commitment to your candidate. All the other means of voter contact  —   particularly television and radio ads and robocalls or personal phone calls  —   are increasingly viewed as either ineffective or even counterproductive at changing voter behavior. The Cruz team is not sitting on its ground game lead in South Carolina, which demographically is far closer to Iowa than it is to New Hampshire. In Iowa, 64 percent of caucus attendees   as evangelical Christians. In New Hampshire, 23 percent of GOP primary voters self identified as evangelical Christians, and among that group, Donald Trump defeated Cruz by a 4 point margin. In South Carolina, 65 percent of primary voters   as evangelical Christians. In addition to the   of a “Camp Cruz” in South Carolina for the Cruz campaign’s volunteer    canvassers, several Cruz supporting Super PACS are mounting their own ground game efforts in the Palmetto state. As the Daily Beast reports: Keep the Promise —  which is actually   into several different PACs, each funded by a different billionaire family —  has blithely tossed the traditional super PAC playbook to the winds. In fact, they’ve taken on typical campaign operations: gathering voter data, targeting likely Cruz supporters, and knocking on thousands of doors to get out the vote. The super PAC has had upwards of 250 people canvassing the state, targeting the homes of persuadable Republican voters. Thus far, they estimate they’ve knocked on more than 93, 000 doors. And by Election Day, they’re shooting to have knocked on 100, 000. In any given week, they say, 100 to 150 individual people spend   days doing the  . And most of them get paid   …     South Carolina politicos describe it as an effective, relentless operation. And it has some of Cruz’s opponents feeling a little jittery. “I’ll be very shocked, honestly, if Ted Cruz doesn’t win the primary,” said an operative for a rival campaign, citing Keep the Promise’s blanketing of the Upstate. Trump has led by double digits in all the recent Palmetto State polls. But some are skeptical that his lead is really that commanding. And they point to the different ground games —  particularly, to that of Keep the Promise —  as evidence for their doubt. Keep the Promise staff explained that the group has been   across the state, in a few targeted regions and counties, since last November. In early January, those   started focusing on persuasion: identifying likely Republican primary voters who favor an Evangelical Christian candidate, knocking on their doors, and having conversations aimed at persuading them to back Cruz. When the votes are counted on Saturday, we will learn whether the majority of polls in South Carolina got it wrong, just as the polls in Iowa did, or if they accurately predicted the winner, as they did in New Hampshire."
Nate Silver: Polling Error Could Be ’Higher Than Usual’ Thanks to Late-Breaking Undecideds - Breitbart,"Many 2016 polls may prove incorrect because so many Americans are undecided or else say they are backing third parties, says Nate Silver, founder of the “data journalism” site fivethirtyeight. com. [“Undecideds are MUCH higher than normal,” Silver said in a Tuesday morning tweet. “So risk of a polling error  —   in either direction  —   is higher than usual. ”  2) Undecideds are MUCH higher than normal.

That is up from one out of 32 voters in 2012, one out of 27 voters in 2004, and one out of 10 voters in 2000, when Texas Gov. George W. Bush barely beat Vice President Al Gore.

If the polls understate Trump’s support by three percent by a uniform margin of three percent, Clinton still wins, although just barely, Silver said.  However, in a prior tweet, Silver noted that Trump is doing much better than 2012 Republican candidate Gov. Mitt Romney in the midwestern states, where he may be able to pick up wins that would give him 270 Electoral votes. But mostly it’s the Electoral College.

Phyllis Schlafly’s Last Stand: The Inside Story of the Conservative Icon’s Internal Battle for Survival - Breitbart,"Allies of Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) are now targeting conservative legend Phyllis Schlafly, a leading grassroots   voice for half a century, because Schlafly endorsed billionaire businessman Donald Trump for president in the 2016 GOP primary. [Several Cruz supporters inside Eagle Forum are unhappy with Phyllis Schlafly’s Trump endorsement, and have been working behind the scenes against her for months. They have leaked emails, engaged in personal attacks, and even advanced an argument questioning whether the    Schlafly is still competent enough to run the organization. Now, several board members of one wing of the tripartite Eagle Forum organization have for the first time in more than four decades of existence called together a special board meeting at which they purported to have voted to remove Schlafly’s handpicked successor as president of the organization and claim to have seized control of the organization and its bank accounts from the longtime activist.  They might not be done yet, as they have another special meeting scheduled for early May at which they intend to —  sources say —  remove Schlafly herself as chairman of the board. What’s more, Schlafly’s own daughter, Anne Cori, has sided with the other Cruz supporters inside Eagle Forum against her mother, creating a divide inside the family as Phyllis and her other children, including son Andy, back Trump over Cruz in the 2016 primary. Cori admits that her actions run counter to her mother’s wishes, but says she is acting out of “love” for her mother. For the first time here, the inside story of Schlafly’s battle for survival —  including exclusive interviews with her, her daughter who’s working against her, and several of the others involved —  will be told. In dueling Breitbart interviews, both Schlafly and Cori detail how painful this has been for both of them —  and how it’s torn apart one of America’s leading conservative families. This story offers a front row view into how Cruz allies operate throughout the conservative movement. They have aggressively pressured conservatives into publicly supporting the senator —  or at least not supporting someone else —  and even sought to “blacklist” those who don’t, so as to fit Cruz’s narrative of being the one candidate who the conservative movement “united” behind. At one point, according to Eagle Forum president Ed Martin, Cruz allies inside Eagle Forum wrote a press release that they demanded Schlafly sign onto before the Iowa caucuses. The press release was intended to serve as a sort of statement of neutrality that would walk back the positive comments Schlafly had made about Trump and make clear that she likes Cruz too and hadn’t endorsed anyone. But Schlafly resisted these pressures, refusing to sign their statement before the Iowa caucuses and later openly endorsing Trump before the Missouri primary. The story even entangles Cruz’s   campaign manager Jeff Roe, a political operative with deep ties in Missouri politics —  Schlafly’s home base for half a century, where her endorsement of Trump carried great weight. Roe had been lobbying Schlafly’s handpicked successor Ed Martin for weeks to get Eagle Forum on Cruz’s side. Martin says that by doing so, Roe “inserted himself” into this   dispute. A lot of the dispute centers around internal Eagle Forum emails that were leaked out to the Cruz campaign and made their way to Roe. In the emails, Schlafly’s son Andy brutally criticized the Texas Senator and his wife Heidi, even making the explosive charge that the Cruzes are “feminists. ” In a roundabout way, thanks to Schlafly’s daughter Anne Cori and fellow Eagle Forum board rebel Cathie Adams of Texas, those emails were leaked to Roe —  and Roe confronted Martin with them. Roe doesn’t deny confronting Martin about the emails, but he does deny deeper conversations with Martin about Schlafly’s position on the election. Martin says Roe is lying, LISTEN TO ED MARTIN ON BREITBART NEWS DAILY ON SIRIUSXM: Meanwhile, all of this coming to light adds a renewed focus to the core issues Schlafly believes are of utmost importance. As the drama unfolds, immigration, education, trade, and, most importantly, national sovereignty, are back at the forefront, Schlafly told Breitbart News in a nearly   interview. Schlafly has led Eagle Forum ever since she founded the organization back in 1972. She has fought against the Institutional Left and GOP establishment, elites she calls “the kingmakers,” for decades. Now she’s fighting internally for survival, and she’s fighting back hard against several rebels who’ve been around her for decades. Schlafly has already largely regained control of parts of the organization, but the plotters against her claim that they have control of one of Eagle Forum’s three wings. The organization will likely litigate whether that wing of Eagle Forum, a   part of the group that is technically a 501( c)(4) will remain under Schlafly’s control, but she and her allies have successfully booted the rebels from the 501( c)(3) wing already. Last Friday, they fired several people involved in or close to the coup attempt, and officially they are now barred from publicly identifying themselves with the Eagle Forum 501( c)(3) wing. Eagle Forum is split into three separate parts: A 501( c)(3) a 501( c)(4) and a political action committee (PAC). Last week, for the first time in the organization’s   history, a group of Eagle Forum 501( c)(4) board members called for a special meeting of the board. At least two of those Eagle Forum board members who called for this meeting are supportive of Ted Cruz: Cathie Adams of Texas and Eunie Smith of Alabama. Shirley Curry of Tennessee, the third board member who called for the meeting, hasn’t publicly confirmed whom she is backing in the presidential race, but sources close to the goings on believe she is a Cruz supporter. The special meeting of the 501( c)(4) board happened on Monday, April 11 —  and, rather than taking place in person as normal board meetings have since the 1970s, the meeting happened over the phone. An email was sent to all the 11 board members announcing that Ed Martin, the organization’s president and former chairman of the Missouri GOP who is Schlafly’s chosen successor, would not be leading the meeting. The Cruz supporters attempting the coup d’etat against Schlafly would refuse to recognize Martin as the officiator of the meeting. The people who called the meeting were Adams, Smith and Curry. In the lead up to that Monday meeting, Martin —  at Schlafly’s direction with the involvement of her son John as well —  made several moves that further infuriated the   rebels. On the previous Friday morning, Martin fired Glyn Wright as executive director of Eagle Forum. Martin confirmed to Breitbart News that he fired Wright on Friday, and the reasoning was “disloyalty” to Schlafly. The news of Wright’s departure came as a shock to many in the conservative movement, as Wright for the past several years has been a core leader in Eagle Forum’s Capitol Hill operations. Wright herself has not responded to repeated phone calls or text messages seeking comment about her termination. Also on Friday morning, Martin used the 501( c)(3) wing of Eagle Forum —  again, at Schlafly’s direction —  to terminate the involvement of several of the 501( c)(4) wing rebels against Schlafly. The five who were terminated for the actions against Eagle Forum and against Schlafly are: Cathie Adams of Texas, Eunie Smith of Alabama, Shirley Curry of Tennessee, Rosina Kovar of Colorado and Carolyn McLarty of Oklahoma. All except Curry have offered public support for Cruz’s campaign. McLarty is a Republican National Committeewoman from Oklahoma —  and the Cruz campaign prominently celebrated her endorsement of the senator’s presidential bid with a press release. In that 501( c)(3) emergency meeting that Martin called on Friday, which was held via telephone, a number of board members also had successors elected. People close to Schlafly have long been skeptical of Adams’ motives due to comments Adams made to the Dallas Morning News earlier this cycle alleging that Schlafly’s endorsement of Trump was a “manipulation. ” The term suggests that the    Schlafly is no longer capable of making such decisions on her own anymore. “We have no respect for that man,” Adams told the Dallas newspaper of Trump back in  . “[Schlafly’s endorsement] is going to be widely dismissed. At 91, it is just totally unfair to impose upon someone who has such a beautiful legacy   …     I think this was very much a manipulation. When you’re 91 and you’re not out with the grass roots all the time, it is very much taking advantage of someone. ” Schlafly’s endorsement of Trump came with a pledge from the GOP frontrunner to support the Republican Platform, which is full of policy positions that grassroots conservatives like. But, Adams told the Dallas Morning News, she believes Cruz is better than Trump with the platform. “If we were going to be asking Ted Cruz about the platform, he would be able to give us a wonderful dissertation on each one of those plans. That is the caliber of the man,” Adams said. “Where with Donald Trump he says he going to bully people, negotiate with people, he’s going to have good people around him. That’s it. And that is going to make America great? Really?” Adams has since apologized to Schlafly over the phone last week over those comments but hasn’t asked the Dallas Morning News to retract or change them —  and told Breitbart News that she was talking about Trump, not Schlafly, when she used the word “manipulation” in that quote to the Dallas Morning News. “OK, let me ask you a question: Who do you think is being looked at in a way that is negative —  do you think it’s Phyllis Schlafly?” Adams responded when Breitbart News read her that Dallas Morning News quote and asked her what she meant. “No, what I’m asking you though is do you think she was manipulated into endorsing Trump?” Breitbart News asked Adams directly as a  . “What I feel and was trying to say and maybe I didn’t say it as articulately as I could have and should have is that I have, as I said, no respect for Donald Trump,” Adams replied. “And I hit him. So my negative was not in any way intended for Phyllis Schlafly. I love and adore her. I would be hurt more than I can even express if I hurt Phyllis Schlafly. I don’t really think it’s fair to call —  it would certainly be an uninformed statement to say that I ever would do anything that would be hurtful to Phyllis Schlafly. But I don’t mind at all telling you that I intended to hurt Donald Trump. That comment, what I was trying to say, was that I don’t support Donald Trump. ” “Right, but again, you said you think it was ‘very much a manipulation,’” Breitbart News followed up again. “What did you mean by that?” “I think that Donald Trump, when he speaks that he is a very good salesman,” Adams replied. “I think that maiming people who are my friends are not understanding clearly the role that he has played in this and that he thinks he can turn the American government into him just being a CEO. So any negative there, please make it very, very clear that this is a reflection not upon Phyllis Schlafly but upon Donald Trump. ” “OK, but you think she was clear in her  …     Is she just the same as she’s always been and able to make an endorsement, I mean she’s been doing this for a half a century?” Breitbart News asked Adams in another   question. “I think that Phyllis Schlafly is just as free today to anchor herself and be able to choose a candidate as she’s always been able to,” Adams replied. “We have had times in the past where we would disagree over a candidate, and this has not been a divisive point at all. But why is it more of a point now? I think it’s because of the stuff of Trump. It has nothing to do with Phyllis. It’s not Phyllis’ ability to make decisions and to think —  it’s not any of that. Any negative [I’ve said] focuses on Donald Trump period. Nothing on Phyllis Schlafly. But absolutely no pulling of punches on Donald Trump. If you would write something to that effect, I would be forever grateful. ” Adams’ central role in this story connects all the way back to emails she was leaking to Ted Cruz’s campaign. She admitted to Breitbart News that she leaked the emails, in which Eagle Forum board member and Phyllis Schlafly’s son Andy Schlafly was critical of Cruz and his wife Heidi, to the Cruz campaign. The emails, which Andy Schlafly sent to his mother Phyllis and copied her daughter Ann Cori, ended up being forwarded to Adams by Cori. Adams then sent them to the Cruz campaign —  not directly to Jeff Roe, but they eventually made their way to Roe. Roe is Cruz’s campaign manager, known for his aggressive political style. Roe comes from Missouri politics, too, just like many of these Eagle Forum players —  and has a personal relationship that dates back years with Ed Martin. Adams —  who has been a Cruz supporter for years and is heavily involved in Texas politics, having been the former Texas Republican Party chair —  claimed that she didn’t know until a couple days ago who Cruz’s presidential campaign manager was. Adams is currently running for the vice chair slot of the Texas Republican Party. “I was surprised to even hear —  I hate to express ignorance here —  I didn’t even know who Jeff Roe was until I heard his name earlier this week,” Adams told Breitbart News when asked if she forwarded the emails to Roe himself. “No, I don’t think I’ve ever met him. I mean, I know Ted Cruz and I’ve been a supporter of his from the very beginning of the U. S. Senate race. I’m a very, very avid supporter of Ted Cruz’s, but, no, I didn’t know Mr. Roe. I’ve never had any interaction with him. ” Roe, in an interview for this story, confirmed that he doesn’t know Adams and hadn’t interacted with her specifically. Adams, however, did admit to leaking internal Eagle Forum emails to the Cruz campaign. “Well, yes, I am not going to deny that —  it was a friend, a mutual friend from Eagle Forum,” Adams said when asked if she gave emails from inside Eagle Forum to anyone on the Cruz campaign. “I did share an email. But I don’t know Roe, and I’ve never spoken with Jeff about anything. ” Adams wouldn’t say who specifically she leaked the emails to. “Of course I do,” Adams said when asked if she knew which Cruz staffer she leaked the Schlafly emails to. “But I don’t want to get someone in trouble. Whatever that person did with it, it’s their own business. When I see things that hurt my candidate, I think that is something that is very much expected. A friend is a friend, and we’re going to stick up for our friends. ” In two emails which went to his mother Phyllis Schlafly and his sister Anne Cori among others, Andy Schlafly argued that both Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi Cruz are “feminist. ” He also calls Ted Cruz “  Ted” and argued that believing Cruz was a U. S. citizen at the time of his birth in Calgary, Canada, would be like “supporting birthright citizenship” that would ultimately be “hurtful to our immigration positions, on which Trump is so strong. ” The argument that Cruz is somehow a feminist —  and that his wife is too —  is new. Schlafly and Eagle Forum have been fighting against the feminist worldview for decades, and her family stands with her on it. She fought and killed the Equal Rights Amendment, which was being pushed as an effort to amend the U. S. Constitution, and has consistently and repeatedly battled feminists over the course of her career.  Andy Schlafly sent this email, sources confirmed, to Eunie Smith and her assistant Deborah Love. It was sent on the evening of Jan. 12, 2016, as the battle between Cruz and Trump intensified on the campaign trail in Iowa. The email subject heading line reads: “reply to Deborah Re: Ted Cruz’s wife is a feminist. ” It’s unclear if Smith personally leaked this to the Cruz team, or if Love did —  or if they sent it to someone else who sent it to the Cruz team. But it made its way to Roe soon. “Thanks for your insightful comments,” Andy wrote in the first email obtained by Breitbart News. “But my mother has not endorsed Trump.  She has praised several of his courageous positions. If Trump fails early, then those conservative positions go down with him. I don’t want that. Whatever flaws Trump has, he is not a feminist. Ted and Heidi Cruz obviously are,  . Eagle Forum stands, first and foremost, against feminism. In addition, in my humble opinion, supporting birthright citizenship for   Ted at this critical time is hurtful to our immigration positions, on which Trump is so strong. Many, many times fellow conservatives have declared my mother to be wrong on a particular issue, while praising her generally. And every single time that I can think of, my mother ended up being right. Call it intuition, Providence, luck, or whatever, my mother has a certain knack for politics that has virtually never been wrong. I learned that the hard way until I accepted it. ” In a second email from Andy Schlafly —  sent on Jan. 27, 2016, to several Eagle Forum board members, many of whom are also his family members —  he wrote that like the Cruzes, who are “complete feminists,” the Fox News Channel has been taken over by “the pushy feminist Megyn Kelly. ” That email was sent to several people on the board at Eagle Forum, including Phyllis Schlafly and Anne Cori. Cori confirmed she forwarded the private email onto several other people, including Adams. It was Adams who sent it to the Cruz campaign —  which eventually got it into Roe’s hands. Adams admitted she leaked the email to the Cruz campaign, and Cori admitted she blasted the email out to several people including Adams. Roe wasn’t sure which one of his staffers he got the email from. “Donald Trump is the only candidate who stands up against the feminists,” Andy Schlafly wrote in this Jan. 27 email. “Fox News Channel has apparently been completely taken over by the pushy feminist Megyn Kelly, to the point of doing voters an immense disservice and losing millions of viewers. Heidi and Ted Cruz are complete feminists and investment banker Heidi is both running Ted’s campaign and dictating his policy positions. We already will have Hillary on the ballot in November and I don’t see why Republicans should nominate a feminist candidate on our side, too. Eagle Forum, first and foremost, is against feminism. ” Cori’s explanation for blasting the private email out to Adams and others was that she thought it wasn’t confidential —  and she thought her brother would support it getting out. “There was no indication on that email that that was confidential, so I thought he was quite proud of that statement, and I didn’t see any reason not to forward it, so I forwarded it because it’s clearly something he believes,” Cori said of her brother’s communiqué. “I actually sent it to about 30 people, and beyond that who knows —  it could have went anywhere from that point. ” Even so, Cori did deny sending them directly to the Cruz campaign. “No, no, because I don’t have any connection with the Cruz campaign,” she said when asked if she gave it directly to the campaign. What’s perhaps most interesting about these emails is how Roe handled them: The Missourian took the emails to Ed Martin, the president of Eagle Forum and his old friend from Missouri, to tell Martin they needed to talk about it. “[C]an you call me to discuss? I need to take this to TC,” Roe wrote to Martin on Jan. 23 in an email that contained Andy Schlafly’s original Jan. 12 email. Roe confirmed to Breitbart News that “TC” means “Ted Cruz. ” “That’s what I commonly refer to Ted as, yeah,” Roe said in a phone interview. Though he said it in this email that he was going to take the email up to Ted Cruz himself, Roe told Breitbart News when asked if he did: “Nah, I never did. ” The second email, the Jan. 27 one, went from Roe in a text message to Martin. The text message didn’t contain anything other than Andy Schlafly’s email content. In the case of both emails, Roe says he is not sure how they got to him —  whether it be from someone inside his campaign who sent them up to him, or from someone outside. He also originally thought they were mass email blasts, not private emails that leaked their way up to him. “I’m sure it was forwarded from a variety of people, but I got that email from several folks,” Roe said. “It’s probably like I get the letters that they sent out today —  I counted before our conversation, I got probably 25. I got those the same way —  there were a half a dozen people who were forwarding information around that time,” Roe added. “I wanted to just at some point —  obviously, Phyllis is a giant, and I don’t know her son. It wasn’t that long prior that I think Ted had been there, I think to their meeting. So I wanted to track down if this was in fact a position statement or if this was really the feelings going on internally and what we could do to clean this up. ” On the second email, Roe said it was the “same thing” and that “I got that from several” different people. “There was wide discussion about the position that they were going to take in the presidential campaign at that time,” Roe said. Roe told Breitbart News that “nah,” he never ended up actually speaking with Martin about them. But Martin says that’s not true. When asked about the emails from inside her Eagle Forum leaking out to the Cruz campaign, Phyllis Schlafly told Breitbart News she’s not happy about it —  but she turned her attention quickly to Heidi Cruz, the   First Lady of the United States, for signing onto that CFR paper calling for a North American Union. Back when she was at the Council on Foreign Relations, Heidi Cruz —  Ted’s wife —  signed onto a paper backing one of the most radical globalist and open borders ideas in history: The creation of a North American Union. That hasn’t gotten much attention on the campaign trail, but it has been picked up on by a lot of the grassroots. “I’m not in favor of leaking anything or forwarding anybody else’s emails without permission, I’m not in favor of that,” Schlafly said in the interview. “But I will tell you I spent about a year of my life fighting the issue of trying to put the United States in the North American Union. I thought that would have erased our northern and southern borders. I’m very much opposed to that. I like the United States borders we have now, and I have recently learned that Mrs. Cruz was one of the authors of the CFR [Council on Foreign Relations] article that endorsed the North American Union. And as I said, I devoted a lot of my life to fighting this dumb idea of combining our country with any other countries. ” She wouldn’t back up the claim from her son Andy in those private emails that Sen. Cruz is a feminist and wouldn’t expand on the claim that Heidi Cruz is a feminist, other than to say she has heard the criticism of the   First Lady. “Well, I never heard anybody say Cruz was a feminist, but they have said that about his wife,” Schlafly said. Schlafly next explained feminism and why it’s not good for society. “A feminist has their goals, and one of their goals is to change the Constitution to add the Equal Rights Amendment —  that’s what they worked so hard on —  and they’re always trying to push the feminist goal, and I think the feminists are not good for our country,” she said. “For example, women in combat was another big issue for us when the ERA came up in the 70s. The feminists wanted to get women drafted and treated just like men. We opposed that. We oppose women in combat. I just haven’t heard the Cruzes speak out against women in combat. ” When asked about the “feminist” criticism in his interview with Breitbart News, Roe laughed it off. “I haven’t either, that’s why I wanted to talk to Ed,” Roe said when this reporter noted he hasn’t heard that criticism of Cruz before this ever. “I don’t have any reaction. It’s obviously a lot of drama going on over there. I don’t have much to add, but it’s a silly accusation. ” Roe did however point to a New York Times article in which Team Trump seems to be floating all over the place on the issue of feminism without a clear or defined point of view on the matter. It is a similar problem that has cropped up with Trump on issues like abortion or marriage or certain elements of defense policy —  or really anything he has not yet randomly come across and learned —  where he does not have a stated policy position and relies on pure instinct. In an article filed from Milwaukee on the day before Cruz trounced Trump in the Wisconsin primary, the New York Times’ Ashley Parker wrote about Trump’s complicated issues with women in light of a recent interview Ivana Trump did with the New York Post. Ivana Trump’s team, Parker’s article explained, didn’t appear to understand whether Donald Trump was a feminist or not. “A spokeswoman for Ivana Trump, Catherine Saxton, said the interview was simply the result of good timing  —   The Post asked, and Ms. Trump was able to do it,” Parker wrote. “(At one point during the interview Mr. Trump even called his  .) Yet in a sign of Mr. Trump’s complicated relationship with women, Ivana Trump’s staff later called the paper to say Mr. Trump was, in fact, a feminist, before calling again to say he was not  —   and then calling a final time to say he was, indeed, a feminist. ” While Schlafly hadn’t officially endorsed a candidate in the 2016 presidential primary until March, when she endorsed Trump in St. Louis before the March 15 Missouri primary, she had spoken very highly of Trump in a variety of interviews before the Iowa caucuses. The populist and nationalist wing of the conservative grassroots has viewed Cruz as a second choice of sorts to Trump. If Trump couldn’t make it, they believed, Cruz wasn’t a bad alternative. There was even what appeared to be an alliance between the two candidates for the first several months of the campaign, as they avoided attacking each other while they each battled the rest of the GOP field. But Schlafly had done several interviews praising Trump without necessarily officially endorsing him. That undercut Cruz’s narrative, which was —  and still is —  that the conservative movement was uniting behind him. It is the tactic Cruz used to box out everyone from Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker to Dr. Ben Carson to Sen. Rand Paul ( ) to former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. Trump’s support from a longtime movement leader, one who Cruz personally idolized and who shared a home state with his campaign manager, hurt that carefully crafted image. “Jeff Roe inserted himself in this,” Martin told Breitbart News. “Listen, he’s lying,” Martin said when told that Roe denied speaking with him about this particular stuff. “He and I talked about this in December, I told him about —  look, I’m not bragging but I know the rules. I talked to him in December, and he said, ‘Come work for us on these rules stuff,’ and I said, ‘No, I can’t do that.’ I talked to him personally, texted regularly, up until right before Iowa. What they’re really mad about is that Phyllis met with Anne Cori and a few other Eagles and they said, ‘We need you to put out a statement that says you’re not really for Trump —  will you do that?’ So, Phyllis, as Phyllis does, said —  and she called me right after —  said, ‘I just told them I’d think about it.’ Now, for Phyllis, that’s her way of saying, ‘No.’ She doesn’t say ‘no’ directly to people she knows. The next day, this is Friday before Iowa, Roe was texting saying, ‘I need to talk to you’ because he wanted a statement. I suspect Anne Cori and Cathie Adams had predicted, and promised, that they would get a statement out of Phyllis. ” Martin said that leading up to the Iowa caucuses, Cruz backers led a pressure campaign against Schlafly to try to get her to issue a statement saying she backed no one —  neither Cruz or Trump. “The thing that’s crazy about this, the thing that’s silly, if you look at her writings over the last seven or eight months, she had written about Trump and Cruz, and she had written about the issues as you know,” Martin said. “So her perspective was that both those guys had made really good progress on the issues, and yet she was still really assessing it all. So it’s the week before Iowa, the Cruz people are amped up, and they’re trying to force Phyllis to put a statement out. So I went to see Phyllis after this meeting, and she said, ‘What do you think I should do?’ I said, ‘What do you want to do?’ She said, ‘I don’t want to say anything.’ She said, ‘If I say something now, the Friday before Iowa, it’ll be all over Iowa.’ And in fact, her daughter ran a   into Iowa the Sunday of that weekend. And again Phyllis’s point is, again, ‘People are going to do what people are going to do, and I’m not going to sweat it. But I’m not going to have people force me into having to do anything.’ Roe in the middle of that called me and said, ‘Hey, I need to talk to you,’ and I said, ‘Hey, I’m in the middle of my weekend with the Eagles. I’ll call you Monday. ’” Martin says it’s clear to him looking back on it all. “His response, I can picture it now, he said, ‘Ha,’” Martin said. “Because he knew I knew what they were doing. They were trying to get Phyllis to be the big story, ‘Phyllis Schlafly softens statements on Trump.’ The point is, she didn’t fall for it. Those guys all think I was the one [who made that happen] but [what really happened] is when I got to her house I said, ‘What do you want to do?’ She said, ‘I don’t want to put out a statement.’ So I said, ‘Then don’t put out a statement.’ Then she said, ‘It’s really getting people upset.’ Then I said, ‘Well, do what you want.’ But they had drafted a statement they wanted from her, and it read like a Cruz press release, and she said, ‘I’m not doing this.’ So for him [Roe] to say that he hasn’t talked to me, that’s just —  again, I can just tell you, he’s from Missouri, I’m from Missouri. I talked to every campaign except for Jeb [Bush] all the way through, I talked to Carly [Fiorina] I actually didn’t talk to [Marco] Rubio much  …     but I talked to [Ben] Carson, Carly, I even talked to Jim Gilmore regularly. ” However, like Adams and Smith and all those on the side against Schlafly, Roe believes that this whole storyline does not appear to relate too much to the internal divisions at Eagle Forum. Instead, he thinks it more has to do with many of the Eagles’ views on Martin. The narrative those against Schlafly put forward is that Martin is the real problem, not Schlafly. Roe supported this point of view in his interview with Breitbart News. “It’s sad to see an organization that’s been a leader in the conservative movement and truly an iconic person in Ms. Schlafly —  that’s been a leader in the conservative movement for generations —  it’s sad to see,” Roe said. “From my reading, I’ve not —  I don’t know anything except for what I read. But I don’t know if it’s as much as strife between internal [forces] in an organization as it is a result of the presidential. There’s obviously a divide in who they all supported, but that’s not uncommon in presidential campaigns. At this level it’s uncommon, but there’s probably other factors at play than just the presidential. This looks like it’s beyond just who’s supporting whom for president because the group has also had kind things to say, and Ted has been an advocate of the organization and views Phyllis in high regard. So I think it’s more to do with internal things than external presidency. Until you called me yesterday, I’d not been paying hardly any attention to it and hadn’t heard about any of these much outside of what was being publicly reported about what was going on. ” Schlafly herself believes that presidential politics is at least one of the driving motives of those who have plotted against her inside Eagle Forum. “Well, I don’t think that’s the main cause. I think that may be being used by some people because I think our organization is pretty well divided between Trump and Cruz,” Schlafly said when asked if the divide between Cruz and Trump is the reason behind this infighting. “We have a lot of people supporting Trump, and we have a lot of people supporting Cruz, and Cruz people had attempted to make an Eagle Forum endorsement a couple years ago, but I said we have free speech and anybody can endorse anyone she wants. I endorsed Trump when he came to St. Louis and gave that big event, and I did it because he endorsed the Republican platform, which has been the major focus of a lot of the work I’ve done in politics. The one we passed at the last convention is truly a great platform that’s right on all the issues —  right on life, right on marriage, right on what I’m particularly interested in which is national sovereignty and military sovereignty. I don’t think it’s enough, I’m not satisfied with language like ‘a strong national defense.’ I feel that we’re stronger when we’re the best in the world, and I think that the world likes that too because our friends feel safe when we have military superiority. ” Tensions flared even more Sunday night as Schlafly took two actions in the hours leading up to Monday’s telephone conference. Schlafly sent a letter to Cori, McLarty, Curry, Smith, Adams and Kovar calling for them to resign their positions on the board effective immediately. “I write this letter with a heavy heart,” Schlafly wrote to her longtime friends in the short one page letter, obtained by Breitbart News. “For over a week now, I have tried to understand what you are doing and what you intend. Some of you have delayed returning my calls while others have not responded at all. Over the past few days I have heard different versions of what you intend with the board meeting tomorrow. First, it was a question about how we have operated and Eunie said she thought we needed outsiders at Eagle Forum. Next, a reporter told us Cathie is saying this is about planning the future. Finally, this morning Eunie said this is about my judgment on personnel. I don’t know what the true plan is but I believe it is an attack on me and my work. I have fond memories of our work together and our friendships. I will cherish those. At this time, I ask you to resign immediately from the Board so that I may continue with Eagle Forum’s important work. ” Phyllis Request for Resignations April 10, 2016. pdf by Wynn Marlow,  The second move Schlafly made against the plotters was the hiring of legal counsel that ordered them to immediately cease and desist all activities related to this coup. The legal counsel’s letter, sent on Sunday to all six, notified them that any actions they planned to take at the meeting on Monday would be beyond their legal authority and therefore void from the outset. Also, their call to a meeting —  the official meeting notice —  was as such “null and void. ” “Eagle Forum therefore demands that you immediately cease and desist any actions to move forward with that meeting,” the letter sent to all six, also obtained by Breitbart News, reads. “Eagle Forum further demands that you cease and desist all actions you are taking or may take that violate your fiduciary duties to Eagle Forum. Be advised that any actions you take in violation of your fiduciary duties to Eagle Forum will result in your being personally liable for any damages caused. ” The letter, from attorney Stephen R. Clark of the St.   Runnymeade Law Group who also serves as the president of the St. Louis Federalist Society, went on to order the preservation of all documents by these rogue board members. It also noted that Eagle Forum will “consider taking legal action” against any of these people involved in this action especially if they go public with statements that are untrue about what is going on inside the organization. ceaseanddesistletterfinal. pdf by Wynn Marlow,  When the time came on Monday for the impromptu board meeting conference call, all sides were dug in. The board members were determined to remove Martin from his post. The new steps Schlafly took in the interim had escalated matters further. The rebels were not backing down —  and they were moving forward with their runaway board meeting despite Schlafy’s and her lawyers’ warnings that doing so was not within their power. On this conference call board meeting, they ran down a list of things they intended to accomplish. First, they passed a motion terminating Martin as the president of Eagle Forum. Then they moved forward with a motion to seize the bank accounts of Eagle Forum and then through other parts of their agenda. Schlafly blasted them in a statement shortly after the meeting. “At 2 p. m. today, 6 directors of Eagle Forum met in an improper, unprecedented telephone meeting,” Schlafly said in the statement, which was publicly distributed by Martin. “I objected to the meeting and at 2:11pm, I was muted from the call. The meeting was invalid under the Bylaws but the attendees purported to pass several motions to wrest control of the organization from me. They are attempting to seize access to our bank accounts, to terminate employees, and to install members of their own Gang of 6 to control the bank accounts and all of Eagle Forum. The members of their group are: Eunie Smith of Alabama, Anne Cori of Missouri, Cathie Adams of Texas, Rosina Kovar of Colorado, Shirley Curry of Tennessee, and Carolyn McLarty of Oklahoma. This kind of conduct will not stand and I will fight for Eagle Forum and I ask all men and women of good will to join me in this fight. ” In response to that, the plotters against Schlafly blasted out a press release of their own that reported Phyllis Schlafly was on the call for the full meeting —  implying that Schlafly was involved in their decisions and, somehow, supported them. Their release did not say she objected to everything they did with her organization. “The Board of Eagle Forum, a 501( c)(4) corporation, held a Board meeting in accordance with and pursuant to the Eagle Forum   and Illinois State Law at 2 pm CDT on April 11, 2016,” the release reads. “Pursuant to the   Eagle Forum First Vice President, Eunie Smith, presided over the meeting.  Eagle Forum Founder, Mrs. Phyllis Schlafly, the Chairman of the Board, was present during the entire meeting, including expressing herself on all seven votes. In Schlafly’s opening statement she said she has spent her life building Eagle Forum as a unique organization of volunteers.  She also said that paid staff cannot order volunteers around. ” Martin told Breitbart News that this characterization of Schlafly’s involvement in this meeting was unfair and inaccurate. “Under the law, you can listen and hear what’s going on and be present only for the person of objecting,” Martin said of what happened on the call. “This is why they’re cynical —  they’re cynical and not telling the truth. Phyllis at the beginning of the meeting said, ‘Before the meeting begins, I would like to say the following: I object to this meeting taking place over the phone, we’ve always met in person, it’s outside of the bylaws, and I want to say this. I always had volunteers —  we were always volunteer and we always worked together —  so why this is happening, and I think this organization is too important and I object.’ Then the lawyer said she will be staying on the call, per her rights, to listen. And she could only participate, every single vote was   with an objection from Phyllis, and that was because under the law —  and I said to her because I knew they were going to ask her, ‘Phyllis, they’re going to say you were there the whole time.’ And she said, ‘I’m staying to hear what they say about my organization. ’” Martin continued by noting that this conversation between himself and Schlafly happened in the presence of their lawyers, and that one lawyer recommended that they leave the meeting before they proceeded with their plans to decimate Eagle Forum and Schlafly’s mission. Schlafly, stubborn as ever, insisted on hearing what they had to say about her organization —  the only reason why she stayed on the call. “So I looked at the lawyers, and one lawyer had recommended we not stay. We’re legally entitled to, but he didn’t think we’d want to, but I said, ‘Listen, you don’t tell Phyllis [what to do]. When she wants to do something, that’s how it goes,’” Martin said. “And then they put out a press release on Phyllis Schlafly. Today there’s a rumor mill email saying that Phyllis is not mentally healthy which is, you know, an actual slur. Now, they’re spinning it saying she’s penalized for staying on the phone call where their purported actions were removing leadership, questioning Phyllis’ personnel decisions, trying to take the banks. I mean, it’s incredible stuff. And by the way, the breach of their fiduciary duty to the organization is significant, and they will be personally liable. Eunie [Smith] is sending emails all over the place, and she’s sending them to the wrong people, who are not employees, and she’s causing herself [legal trouble]. ” Both Smith and Adams, in interviews on the Friday before the meeting, denied outright that the purpose for all of this was to remove Schlafly —  and promised that there would be no such effort. Adams was particularly colorful with her allusions to Schlafly’s age, and it’s among these different interviews that the story about the reasoning for all of this among the   “Gang of 6” begins to change. “You know, when you have a leader who is doing such a fabulous job for 50 years and is so capable and just so right on,” Adams told Breitbart News when asked to explain the purpose of calling the meeting. “There’s a couple things that happened. First of all, we get bored because the need for a board is so minimal with such a fine leader. And then hopefully she passes the baton and is preparing for retirement. Phyllis Schlafly is so brilliant and so capable she’ll never fully retire until the Lord takes her home, but when you have a person in that place —  and, yes, it is likely that some things are going to be a little bit different than from what has been done in the past. So, we are very much entering that transition front with the woman that we absolutely love and adore. ” In a   question, Breitbart News asked Adams directly if she meant that Schlafly was incapable of leading Eagle Forum because of her age. She said that’s not what she meant, but again repeated the line “until the Lord calls her home. ” “No, I’m not saying that at all. No, no. I’m just saying that there needs to be a transition in place for the future,” Adams said. “When you’re 91 years old, that’s something that Phyllis has made a very deliberate plan to pass on as much information to volunteers. This [Eagle Forum] is Phyllis   from the beginning and all the way until the Lord calls her home. This is absolutely Phyllis Schlafly centered. ” Over the course of several questions and answers later in the interview, Adams repeatedly kept referring back to Phyllis Schlafly’s age —  and that she didn’t want to leave anything to “chance,” and that Schlafly has shown more “frailty” in recent years. Below is a transcript of that section of the interview: BREITBART NEWS NETWORK (BNN): “Since 1972, there has never been a special meeting called like this —  of the board?” ADAMS: “Well, Phyllis hasn’t been in this particular place before where she is preparing for the future of Eagle Forum even if she is not there. Phyllis Schlafly’s agenda is to do that. As the board, we feel responsible to come along her side and be a blessing to her. That is what this is all about. For anyone to spin otherwise, it’s like ‘oh my goodness. What is your motive? ’” BNN: “So this is for planning for the future and everything, but again why do it in the way that is ‘call a special meeting’ like this? Is there not a regular order way to do this rather than calling an emergency meeting?” ADAMS: “Well, actually, board meetings being once a year, when they are going through this transition that Phyllis has initiated, it really does require a more than just once a year meeting. And I don’t know if I’ve even said this to you, but my father is 91, he’s the same age, and he lives with us. When he has the will to be drafted, or a change in his will, or whatever, we don’t wait for six months or whatever to take care of it because he wants it done sooner rather than later. We don’t know what the future holds we have absolutely no idea the number of our days —  only the Lord knows that. And so, it’s not an extreme measure to say that we want to meet more than once a year and calling the bylaws requires three of the board members to do anything, so the three board members are the first vice president, the second vice president —  and I’m the second vice president, by the way —  and then a woman who was sitting at the table coming up with the name Eagle Forum when Phyllis Schlafly started the organization. The three of us, who absolutely love and adore and want everything done according to Phyllis’s will, should be accomplished and not to leave anything to chance. I think you don’t leave anything to chance. When we are responsible as board members, we just don’t want to leave it to chance. We want her will to be accomplished. ” BNN: “Ok, now every single one of you guys who called this —  so, you, Eunie, Shirley, Rosina and Carolyn —  are all Cruz supporters, right?” ADAMS: “This is not about Cruz and Trump, but, yes, that is a fact. But that is not what this is about. That, of course, is something that we knew was a lift in calling this. ” BNN: “So, she’s 91. Why not do this when she was 75? Why not do this when she was 80? Why not do this when she was 85? Why not do this when she was 90? Why wait until now in the middle of a presidential election?” ADAMS: “I think the difference is she was much more —  at 75, Phyllis Schlafly was wearing me out, when I was a much younger age. It’s just now that we are seeing the need for being responsible for our duties as board members and as far as in a presidential election or whatever, it’s just —  it’s not a presidential issue. There are needs, and just a timeframe of uncertainty that has culminated. It’s not presidential. ” BNN: “So what changed from when she was 90, or 85 —  this year —  that you guys have to call for this? What has changed in her behavior or the way that she’s been leading the organization? What’s different this year?” ADAMS: “There have been some changes over the past couple of years that we have as a board decided, so it’s time for us to revisit some of those and make sure we’re on the right track and make sure that we’re going in the right direction according to the mission that Phyllis has laid out. I assure you it has nothing in any way whatsoever to do with hurting Phyllis Schlafly. And, no, the intent is not —  that is the nuttiest thing in the world —  to remove her from the board. That is just crazy. ” BNN: “Again, what I’m trying to get at here is: Is there something different about Phyllis this year than last year or the year before that or the year before that? I mean, she was in her high 80s and then 90?” ADAMS: “Maybe some more frailty. I mean, she’s not traveling as much —  she’s still traveling, she’s still doing well. I just think it’s not anything bad or emergency or anything like that, no. But there is more frailty than there was five years ago, 10 years ago. My father, who is even more mobile —  still driving and so on —  if he decides there needs to be a change of some sort, we don’t [delay]. We get it taken care of. We don’t know when the Lord is going to call him home. Maybe, in my own mind and my own heart, because my father lives with us, maybe that was part of my thinking. It maybe changed some of my thinking, made me more aware of a need to prepare for the future because of my own home and my own father moving in with us. ” After Adams stated that she didn’t intend to do anything to “hurt” Schlafly, Breitbart News asked: “If I’m understanding you correctly, you intend to support Phyllis remaining as the head of the organization? You keep saying that you don’t want to do anything to hurt her, but does that mean you want her to remain as the head of Eagle Forum —  all of the different umbrellas of it?” “Absolutely,” Adams replied. “Absolutely. It is the most cruel thing for anyone to intimate that someone would in any way whatsoever say that Eagle Forum is not yours. That is just unconscionable. ” But Schlafly’s own daughter Cori would make no such commitment when asked multiple times directly if there were plans at a forthcoming May 2 board meeting to remove Schlafly as the chair of the board. Below is a transcript of that part of Cori’s half hour interview with Breitbart News: BNN: “At that meeting, will there be an effort to remove any board members?” CORI: “Well, we will find out what happens on that meeting. ” BNN: “OK. ” CORI: “I mean, it’s a board of directors with a lot interesting people, and we will take a vote, and we will abide by the bylaws. ” BNN: “And you’re not intending to remove your mother as chairman of the board at that meeting, are you —  or?” CORI [scoffs]: “I fully love how the scurrilous emails that were put out last week full of lies and innuendoes were intended to make this strange idea about a coup d’état. There is no coup d’état. Because what we have is we have a board of directors who are in charge of the hiring and firing of the paid president. And so that’s what we do. And then we discharge our duty of care for the organization. ” BNN: “OK, but again —  you’re not confirming to me whether or not there’s going to be any effort to remove —  “ CORI: “Well, we’ll just have to —  you know what? That is in the future. We’ll have to have that board meeting. ” BNN: “OK, but can you tell us: Is Phyllis Schlafly going to be the chairman of the board of Eagle Forum at the end of this?” CORI [laughs]: “Well, I think you’re attempting to put words in my mouth on something, and I have no interest in playing into this kind of gotcha questioning. ” BNN: “OK, I’m not trying to ask you a gotcha question. ” CORI: “But that’s what it sounds like, because I’ve already said that to talk speculative about future board meetings is not a good idea. So, then you’re trying to work around the edges then, to say ‘Well, will you do this or will you do that?’ Well, there’s no way around —  I’m damned if I do and damned if I don’t in how I answer that question. So, I think the way that you have presented your question is not an acceptable way to present a question. ” BNN: “OK, moving forward here, is there anything else you can tell us about the upcoming board meeting?” CORI: “We have an upcoming board meeting is what I can tell you. ” In her interview with Breitbart News, Phyllis Schlafly said that she is deeply hurt by the fact that not only her longtime friends and board members are turning on her, but also her own daughter. “Yes, it’s very hard,” she said when asked about her daughter Anne Cori’s support for the rebelling board members. “My sons are all very supportive of what I’m doing. Anne seems to have joined the other side. And I’ve not got any criticism for Anne, but she tries to tell me it’s all because of love for me that they’re doing what they’re doing. I kind of laugh. ” When read this quote from Schlafly over the phone in her interview with Breitbart News, Cori responded by saying: “I love my mother. ” After a long silent pause, Breitbart News followed up: “And are you guys doing what you’re doing out of love for Phyllis Schlafly?” “Yes,” Cori replied. Below is a transcript of what happened next: BNN: “OK, and then that gets back to the whole point of why not respect her wishes? Again, she’s made it very clear what she wants. ” CORI: “We are doing this out of love for Phyllis Schlafly. And we feel strongly about it that this is the best. And there is no other guiding motive for our choices and votes yesterday other than our love and respect for Phyllis Schlafly. ” BNN: “OK, and why isn’t she able to make the decision for herself?” CORI: “Well, you’ll have to ask her that. I mean, I’m not going to comment on what she might say to something because that’s speculative. I just know what my actions are, which are love. And I had a beautiful conversation with her last night. ” BNN: “And you just said though that you think that this is best for her, right?” CORI: “Well, no, it’s best for Eagle Forum. ” BNN: “So, if you’re doing this out of love for her —  and  …    ” CORI: “Well, yes, because Eagle Forum is her life’s work. And this is what’s best for Eagle Forum. ” BNN: “OK, and why doesn’t Phyllis Schlafly know what’s best for Eagle Forum?” CORI: “She had a vote on the board. It’s majority rules because we live in a democracy, and we live by the rule of law. ” Another reason for this battle, in addition to the presidential race divisions over Cruz and Trump, is internal strife at Eagle Forum over who should be Schlafly’s successor. Cori, in many ways, believes she should be the one who follows in her mother’s footsteps. But her mother, sources say, tried her out on the state level in Missouri politics close to home and wasn’t impressed with her leadership skills. So, Schlafly set out on the search for a successor and considered former Rep. Michele Bachmann ( ) for some time, but ultimately decided upon Ed Martin. “Well, I have said that, but I don’t know who else would say that,” she said when asked to confirm that Martin was her chosen successor. “I feel entitled to pick my own successor. Everybody knows that most of our people wanted Michele Bachmann, and I had endless conversations with her trying to work out an arrangement, and we never achieved that. So, I had to give up on that, and so then I found Ed, and Ed agrees with me on all the issues. He knows everybody in politics, so that was extremely helpful. ” Cori confirmed multiple times during her interview that she’s aware her mother wants Martin as her successor.  So did Martin. “Now look, Anne Cori —  and this is a well known situation —  was hired in a leadership role at Eagle Forum, and she was kind of not, it’s not her life’s work. She’s never been active in conservative politics beyond the last few years,” Martin told Breitbart News. “You know, she’s Phyllis’s daughter, and she has certain talents, but all I can say is Phyllis asked me to be her successor because she thought I had skills that would let me be able to keep the organization going and succeeding both in politics and the rest of it. Beyond that, that’s sort of a Phyllis question. You won’t get Phyllis Schlafly to say bad words about her family, but there came a moment —  Look, when I became the president, Michele Bachmann made a run at the job she wanted it. Anne Cori talked about [it]. And Phyllis said to her board that ‘Ed is the kind of guy that has the combination of policy, experience and politics, and I want him to be my successor.’ The board voted on it, and for 15 or 16 months it’s been working that way. I don’t know what more to say. ” Phyllis Schlafly’s   nature means she’s scrappy, a   fighter, and certainly doesn’t play victim. It also means she won’t go down without a fight. “Of course, I’ve won all of my fights,” Schlafly told Breitbart News when asked if she’ll win this one too. She is convinced she’ll be back in the saddle before long and harbors no ill will toward those honest brokers throughout Eagle Forum’s network who do genuinely support Cruz. “I’ve built the best and most respected and most unusual organization,” Schlafly said. “This is an organization of volunteers. A lot of these conservative organizations are based on money. They will have a smart guy at the top and a mailing list. We are an organization of volunteers. I am a volunteer —  I do not take a salary out of Eagle Forum. All my state leaders are volunteers. It’s a different ballgame to run an organization with people who are really all independent contractors that make their own decisions. Now, at one time, I don’t know how many months ago that was, there were a dozen of them who decided to sign a paper endorsing Cruz. And I said that’s alright if they want to endorse Cruz that’s okay. Free speech. ” But there’s no way she’s backing down from her own endorsement of Donald Trump, and she bristles at any suggestion that it was the product of a “manipulation” from Martin or anyone else. “I don’t think Ed [Martin] knew about my endorsement until he read it in the paper,” she said. “He had nothing to do with that. If you want to know why I endorsed Trump, read ‘A Choice Not An Echo.’ I’ve been fighting the kingmakers for, what is it, 40 years —  since 1940 or whatever —  Trump was the one willing to take on the kingmakers, and I didn’t see anyone else who was doing that. ” And what about the claims and allusions by some of her detractors that she’s no longer able to lead her own organization? “They’ve made all kinds of charges against me, but I think they’re just all wrong,” she said. “They’ve tried to say I’m not competent. That’s why I’m doing about two live interviews a day, which you have to be able to do that. I had my doctor write to some of them to deny the fact that I’m heavily medicated. I’m not at all. I’m taking the same three pills morning, noon and evening that I’ve been taking for about 20 years. ” So what really provoked this attempted coup? Was it the Trump endorsement? “I would say that it isn’t the whole story, but it is certainly part of it, and they are using that as an excuse,” Schlafly said when asked if this happened at least in part because of her endorsement of Trump. “It’s certainly part of it because a great many of my Eagles are for Cruz, and really the fight started when they distributed the list of Eagles who are supporting Cruz and acted like it was my list,” she continued. “It confused people, and I did not approve that, but I did not speak out against that. I have never spoken out against Cruz —  I’ve only said nice things about him. ” She believes the actions of the rogue board members are all about who controls of the influential organization she founded. “Part of it is some of them think they want to run Eagle Forum,” she said. “They want to take it over. It’s the best organization on the conservative side, and they’d like to control it. ” Schlafly said they are using her endorsement of Trump as a tool to do that. “Yes. Yes, I think the Trump fight is part of it,” Schlafly said when asked if the Trump endorsement was a “mechanism” by which her detractors have aimed to take control of Eagle Forum. “I think a great number of our members are for Trump. They tell me all the time. And a great many are for Cruz. And I have said we believe in free speech, and individually you can endorse anybody you want. But I did object when they pretended it was Eagle Forum doing it. ” Also, importantly, Schlafly specifically stated that she believes the Cruz campaign itself “could be” behind much of the actions against her internally at Eagle Forum. One reason she gives for that belief is an internal contact list that was leaked to the Cruz campaign. In an article in World Net Daily, Martin pinned the leaked list on an unnamed Eagle Forum member who was also working for the Cruz campaign and passed on the list to them. BNN: “Do you think that the Cruz campaign has had a hand in this as well? Do you think that part of this is retaliation —  I would argue that Trump won Missouri because of you and your endorsement. And there’s plenty of other places where you’ve made a demonstrable difference in this Republican presidential primary. I mean, do you think that part of this is retaliation by the Cruz campaign almost agitating them to do this?” SCHLAFLY: “Well, that could be. That could be. They tried to make it look like Eagle Forum was endorsing Cruz. But Eagle Forum has not taken a position like that. And somebody leaked part of my calling list to the Cruz campaign. I know that because they called some of my best people and asked them to work for Cruz. The only way they could have gotten that calling list is getting it leaked by somebody who is not loyal to me. ” It remains to be seen whether Schlafly and her daughter will patch up their relationship before it’s too late, but at the end of her interview with Breitbart News Cori made clear she had a message for her mom: “I love my mother very much. I think that says it all. ” Schlafly is frequently compared to Maggie Thatcher, another strong woman leader who led the world with President Ronald Reagan back in the 1980s, and now America’s Iron Lady is turning her guns squarely on a possible contested Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July.  “The thing that I’m particularly interested in is the issue that we’ve been so concerned about: The [Republican] National Convention,” Schlafly told Breitbart News, changing the conversation away from the internal strife at Eagle Forum literally on the second question of a 20 minute interview back to what her heart is focused on. “You know all of you press people are now predicting that nobody will get the 51 percent, so we will have an open convention [for] first time I guess since I don’t know what —  1976? We want to be players. So I’ve encouraged our people to try to get elected as delegates, and we’ll meet you in Cleveland. We all want to go to Cleveland in the summer where it’s so hot and muggy. ” WATCH: PHYLLIS SCHLAFLY MAINTAINS SHE HAS CONTROL: "
Northern Ireland peace ’at risk’: UK’s May warned against DUP deal," (CNN) A deal to prop up British Prime Minister Theresa May’s government could come at the cost of peace in Northern Ireland, politicians have warned.  Speaking in London Thursday after a meeting with May, prominent Northern Irish politician and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said he had told May she was ”in breach” of the Good Friday Agreement     the peace treaty which ended 30 years of deadly sectarian violence known as ”The Troubles.” Peace at risk, Following a bruising election result in which her Conservative Party squandered a   majority in Parliament and found itself struggling to form a government, May has attempted to form an alliance with the   Democratic Unionist Party. Under the Good Friday agreement, unionists and Irish republicans like Sinn Fein entered into a   government. The UK government, which at that point gave up direct rule over Northern Ireland, was intended to be a neutral arbitrator between the parties.  By forming a government with the DUP, many commentators have argued the Conservatives would undermine this arrangement and risk the peace process.  ”There’s a level of incompetence . .. and lack of understanding by this government on Northern Ireland that is very troubling,” Peter Hain, former Labour Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, told CNN.  His comments echoed those of former Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who warned earlier this week that May’s actions put the ”fragile” peace at risk.  ”A fundamental part of that peace process is that the UK government needs to be impartial between all the competing interests in Northern Ireland,” he told the BBC. ”And the danger is that however much any government tries, they will not be seen to be impartial if they are locked into a parliamentary deal at Westminster with one of the Northern Ireland parties.” ”The peace process, which was very hard earned over very many years by a lot of people, people shouldn’t regard it as a given. It isn’t certain, it is under stress. It is fragile,” he said.  What were ’The Troubles’?  More than 3, 600 people died in sectarian violence between 1968 and 1998 as unionist and republican terrorist groups carried out bombings, assassinations and other crimes.  The fighting had its roots in a   dispute between the UK and the Republic of Ireland over control over the northern part of the island.  Britain colonized the entirety of Ireland beginning in the 1600s, and it was incorporated into the UK in 1801. In 1920, guerrilla warfare between what became known as the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and unionists led to the partitioning of Northern Ireland and the future Republic of Ireland. Unionists are typically Protestants, who want to keep Northern Ireland as a part of the UK, while republicans are mostly Catholic and favor a united Ireland. Republicans in Northern Ireland, around 35% of the population at the time, did not accept the partition and some adopted armed struggle as a way to break away from the UK. Militant activity by the IRA and other republican groups sparked a rise in Unionist paramilitary and terrorist organizations, as well as a forceful and often brutal response by the British Army, which sent thousands of troops to occupy the country.  Bloody Sunday    a January 1972 shooting in Derry of 14 unarmed republican activists by the British Army    was a flashpoint in the conflict. In 1985, the IRA attempted to assassinate then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher with a   bomb planted at the hotel she and her cabinet were staying at in Brighton. Thatcher escaped injury, though five people were killed including a sitting Conservative MP. The IRA also carried out a   bombing campaign targeting major cities throughout the UK mainland, including deadly attacks in London and Birmingham.  Ceasefire negotiations began in the 1980s, eventually culminating in the Good Friday Agreement, which was negotiated by the governments of the UK, US and Ireland, as well as representatives of Northern Ireland groups.   Political chaos, Both Sinn Fein and the DUP have their roots in ”The Troubles.”  Sinn Fein, a   liberation party modeled on similar movements in South Africa and the Palestinian territories, was originally formed as the political wing of the IRA. The DUP are a   Christian party founded by Protestant preacher Ian Paisley in 1971. The party has historical links to unionist paramilitary groups, and during the 2017 election campaign some of its candidates were endorsed by the Loyalist Communities Council, which is supported by several militant organizations.  Under the Good Friday Agreement, unionist and republican parties are supposed to form a   administration that governs Northern Ireland.  However, in January, Sinn Fein pulled out of the government over a corruption scandal involving DUP leader Arlene Foster, who is currently negotiating with May.  That has left the region without a government for five months. Sinn Fein and others have argued that any deal in which the DUP formed part of a UK government would worsen the current situation.  Rule over Northern Ireland is due to revert to London if parties fail to reach a deal on a   government, but what that means for the country if the DUP is a part of that government at Westminster remains to be seen.

Wife of Orlando Gunman Is Charged Under Antiterrorism Laws - The New York Times,"OAKLAND, Calif.  —   She fired none of the shots, she was nowhere near the bloody scene, and none of the evidence made public so far hints that she shared her husband’s violent jihadist ideology. Yet Noor Zahi Salman, the widow of the gunman who massacred revelers at an Orlando nightclub, stood before a federal judge on Tuesday as the only person charged in the attack. In the early hours of June 12, Ms. Salman’s husband, Omar Mateen, killed 49 people at Pulse, a gay nightclub, and wounded 53 others in one of the worst terrorist attacks on American soil. Before being fatally shot by the police, Mr. Mateen, a    security guard, declared his allegiance to the Islamic State. Though suspicion and scrutiny naturally fall on people close to someone who commits terrorism or mass murder, it is rare for a wife or a girlfriend to end up facing charges. But in a brief hearing in federal court in Oakland, a federal prosecutor, Roger Handberg, explained why the authorities considered Ms. Salman an exception. “She knew he was going to conduct the attack,” Mr. Handberg said. An indictment unsealed on Tuesday accused Ms. Salman, 30, of “aiding and abetting the attempted provision and provision of material support to a foreign terrorist organization,” a charge that can carry a sentence of life in prison. She was also charged with obstruction of justice for allegedly misleading police officers and federal agents, who interviewed her for 12 hours on the day of the shooting. Ms. Salman went with her husband to buy ammunition, drove him to Orlando when he apparently scouted his target, and knew that he watched jihadist propaganda videos. Those could be innocent acts or indications of criminal culpability, depending on her own intent and what she knew of his. Her fate could turn on evidence about her frame of mind, including how much she was controlled by her husband, who she has said abused her. “We’ve seen the government trying to widen the definition of ‘material support,’ and the increased visibility of women being involved in jihadist movements” makes it easier to imagine charging them with terrorism, said Nimmi Gowrinathan, a visiting professor at the City College of New York who studies women in violent situations around the world. In an interview last fall with The New York Times, her only public statement since the attack, Ms. Salman said she had not known what her husband planned to do, a claim that her uncle, Al Salman, made repeatedly outside the courthouse on Tuesday. Prosecutors, who plan to pursue the case in a federal court in Florida, gave little new information, leaving unclear what evidence they had or why seven months had passed before charges were filed. Ms. Salman, who was arrested on Monday and has a young son fathered by Mr. Mateen, has been living with relatives in Rodeo, Calif. northeast of San Francisco. Visibly shaking in a   and gray jail uniform, Ms. Salman stood in court Tuesday and, in a barely audible voice, told Magistrate Judge Donna M. Ryu, who had to ask her to speak up, that she understood the charges against her. Only when she was led from the courtroom did she raise her head and let her eyes search the packed gallery. On Wednesday, the judge will consider whether to grant bail. The married couple who fatally shot 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. in 2015 provide the clearest case of a wife as accomplice, but examples remain rare. A study of more than 100 terrorists in Western countries who acted alone or in pairs found that most of them were single.   percent confided in someone about their plans, the authors found, but   research showed that only 4 percent told a spouse, a girlfriend or a boyfriend. The closest parallel to Ms. Salman may be Katherine Russell, the widow of one of the Boston Marathon bombers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, and the mother of his child. The bombs detonated at the race in 2013 were made in the home she and her husband shared, and testimony at the trial of the surviving bomber  —   Ms. Russell’s    Dzhokhar Tsarnaev  —   indicated that her computer had been used for a search on the rewards that come to the widow of a martyr for Islam. Ms. Russell talked to investigators but refused to testify before a grand jury without immunity from prosecution. Federal agents investigating the case were eager to bring charges against her, but prosecutors decided not to. Ms. Salman and Mr. Mateen’s former wife, Sitora Yusufiy, have both said that he beat them severely and tried to control every aspect of their lives. Citing that abuse, a lawyer for Ms. Salman, Linda Moreno, said recently that it was “misguided and wrong to prosecute her. ” Experts say that domestic violence is a common trait among mass killers and terrorists, and that close relatives are often among their victims. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was also accused of domestic violence by a previous girlfriend. “Misogyny and extremism work together very often, so abuse is entrenched in these cases,” Dr. Gowrinathan, the City College professor, said. But, she added, sympathy for women as victims of abuse tends to evaporate in terrorism cases. At the time of the Pulse shooting, Ms. Salman was at home in Fort Pierce, Fla. a   drive from Orlando, but the indictment charged that she had been abetting her husband’s plans since at least late April. Prosecutors say she knowingly misled the F. B. I. agents and Fort Pierce police officers who interviewed her. The indictment also says the government wants her to forfeit more than $30, 000, which may be connected to the jewelry she has said her husband lavished on her in the final days of his life. In interviews last year, friends and acquaintances described Ms. Salman as a relatively naïve young woman, a doting mother who could have unwittingly witnessed the buildup to her husband’s attack. The daughter of Palestinian immigrants, she struggled in high school, they said, but earned an associate degree at a community college before meeting Mr. Mateen, a son of Afghan immigrants, on an Arab dating website. “I was unaware of everything,” Ms. Salman said in the Times interview last year. “I don’t condone what he has done. I am very sorry for what has happened. He has hurt a lot of people. ” She said that she had known her husband was viewing jihadist videos, but that she had disapproved and forced him to turn them off so that their son would not see them. She said that the drive to Orlando had seemed innocent, and that the ammunition purchase was unremarkable for a security guard who practiced at a shooting range. The F. B. I. questioned Mr. Mateen after he told   in 2013 that he had ties to terrorist groups like Hezbollah, and again in 2014, when his name came up in another terrorism case. But agents never found evidence that he was plotting an attack. In the Times interview, Ms. Salman said she had thought that if her husband had been a danger, the F. B. I. would have arrested him."
Joe Biden goes off on the 2016 campaign: ’So much for the shining city on the hill’,"’  ’ ’   Vice President Joe Biden went off on the 2016 election as a whole   on Thursday, ripping it as a   spectacle that was a   ”battle of personalities” instead of ”a battle of ideas,” and   pointing a finger at the media for its coverage of the race. ’ ’   Speaking at a  in Washington put together   by New York University, Biden called the election ”tough,”   ”ugly,” and ”divisive.” ’ ’   ”This has been a very tough election,” he said. ”It’’s been ugly.   It’’s been divisive. It’’s been coarse. It’’s been dispiriting.” ’ ’   ”I find myself embarrassed by the nature of the way in which this   campaign was conducted,” the vice president continued. ”So much   for the shining city on the hill.” ’ ”   Biden asked why there wasn’t more discussion of policy or     issues. ” ’’ ’   ”Hillary Clinton was the single most qualified on the fact of it   to run for president of the United States that we’’ve had,   period,” he said. ”It wasn’’t that she didn’’t have all these   ideas. She did. But the press, you didn’’t cover it.” ’ ”   But he added a caveat, saying it was understandable when stories   like the leaked tape of Trump boasting about being able to make   sexual advances on women regardless of their consent because he   was famous arise, they’re impossible to avoid. ” ’   ”It wasn’’t your fault,” he said. ”When a guy talks about grabbing   a woman’’s private parts, when a guy says some of the incredibly   outrageous things that were said, it sucks up all the oxygen in   the air.” ’ ’   Biden asked the crowd what they knew about the 2016 election   other than the campaign slogans, such as Trump’’s ”Make America   Great Again” and Clinton’’s ”Stronger Together,” which Biden   mistakenly called ”Forward Together.” ’ ’   He also called for continued vigilance from progressives once   Trump assumes office in January. ’ ’   ”We should not remain silent one instant when this administration   goes after the progressive values we care about,” he said. ”We   should not back away one scintilla from the arguments and the   merits of all the things we care about. But we should listen and   we should realize the American people are a lot better than   they’’re given credit for right now.” ’ ’   Biden said recently he would  but he backed   slightly off of that in an interview with the ”Late Show” host   Stephen Colbert earlier this week. ’ ’   ”I don’’t plan on running again, but to say you know what’’s going   to happen in four years I just think is not rational,” Biden said   in the interview. ’ ’   He added that you can ”never say ’’never. ’’” ’ ’   ”Hell, Donald Trump’’s going to be 74.

Giuliani: Obama ’Lackadaisical’ With Regards to Terrorism - Breitbart,"Sunday on New York AM 970 radio’s “The Cats Roundtable,” former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani slammed President Barack Obama in an interview with John Catsimatidis, saying the president has a “lackadaisical attitude” when it comes to dealing with terrorism.  “I think we’re going to see a more peaceful world because we’ll have a president who’s going to put his foot down with regard to this radical Islamic terrorism that’s going on,” Giuliani predicted of Obama’s successor, Donald Trump. “The goal of the United Stats of America has to be to wipe out radical Islamic terrorism, and that’s so different than we experienced for the last eight years when we made believe it didn’t exist. ” He added, “The president  —   the kindest thing I can say is he has a lackadaisical attitude about [terrorism].

"’American Psycho’ Author Bret Easton Ellis Reads Monologue Blasting SJWs, BLM Pandering, Political Correctness - Breitbart","American Psycho author Bret Easton Ellis read a monologue written by provocateur and previous Milo Show guest, Alex Kazemi, during his latest podcast, blasting political correctness, Black Lives Matter, and the effect that the “liberal systematic narrative” has had on culture, in particular the Video Music Awards. [“I really, really hope that Lena Dunham doesn’t start turning into the Andrea Dworkin of our generation, yet another feminist, social justice warrior finding women as victims seemingly everywhere,” Ellis said at the 10:48 mark of his podcast on Monday.  “But it seemed as if the MTV awards were enshrined to this sort of thinking as well, going way out of their way to instil female empowerment, which is getting very, very boring,” he declared. “I’m not going to say that’s the reason that the VMA’s were down 35% this year, but I’m going to ask who the hell was the show for this year? There was nothing disturbing or shocking, no blurred lines, or stoned Miley bitching it out on stage with Nicki. There was no kind of rupture, and therefore no kind of fun. ” “Everyone got along and the kind of fake solidarity and fake inclusiveness that my favourite    provocateur felt the need to denounce in an email to me, like he did with the last year’s VMA’s  …     and which really echoed what so many people felt about this year’s dreadful variety show,” continued Ellis, before reading out Kazemi’s monologue. “This millennial wrote, and I’m quoting here  …     ‘The Black Lives Matter Sabbath that was the 2016 Video Music Awards dawned the end of our culture as we know it. The entire show was an ode to the liberal systematic narrative that is ‘white people are bad’ so let’s just make every other person on the screen a black female, because we’re just so terrified of threatening our millennial demographic raised on a diet of trigger warnings, and safe spaces, and  . ’” “’Almost every frame in the show eluded to   feminism and women’s empowerment. This was totally fake and corporate, but this is the end result of capitalism, because the MTV awards are now officially the system,’” Ellis went on, reading Kazemi’s email. “’The show’s mask was to make everyone seem like a good person via pandering references to Black Lives Matter, police brutality, and Martin Luther King. This was the script, the dogma, which is all about obeying. Obeying the script. And the fear you could feel hovering over everything if anyone dared to flip it. This is what is killing our culture right now, the fear of punishment for not adhering to   ideology. The fear of not adhering to the corporate culture status quo. ’” “’MTV doesn’t want us to receive any dangerous pop imagery, because they’re scared of offending, unless it falls under the safety hood of ‘politically correct.’ The problem is pop music should offend. Pop music should not be politically correct,’” Ellis concluded, still quoting Kazemi’s words. “’Fuck MTV and fuck the VMA’s. ’” Ellis has previously slammed political correctness and social justice on his podcast, most notably in August when he blasted the “little snowflakes,” language policing “Nazis,” and hysterical feminists in a long monologue of his own.

"Peter Schweizer: Kushner’s Failure to Disclose Billion-Dollar Ties to Goldman Sachs, George Soros Is ‘Massive, Massive Problem’ - Breitbart","Breitbart News Senior    Peter Schweizer addressed reports that President Trump’s    Jared Kushner had an undisclosed business relationship with Goldman Sachs and billionaire   financier George Soros on Wednesday’s Breitbart News Daily. [“This is a company that not only is Jared Kushner an investor in, he   in 2014,” Schweizer noted. “So this is not some passive investment that one of his advisers said to put money into, and was forgotten about. He   it. It’s a real estate tech startup. Obviously it has a lot of ambitions. He’s got a lot of money in it, and he failed to disclose it on his financial forms. ”   LISTEN: “That’s a massive, massive problem. The whole purpose of disclosures  —   whether you are asking the Clintons to do it, Barack Obama to do it, Jared Kushner to do it, or Mitch McConnell to do it  —   is so the American people can know: who are they financially dependent on, who do they have ties to, who might have leverage over them?” Schweizer explained.  “The problem is that Jared Kushner’s position in the White House, he is essentially the liaison with the business community. He’s not in charge of protocol. He’s not in charge of public outreach. He is basically the   with the business community, so he is ground zero for precisely the kinds of concerns and issues that one might have about very, very troubling financial transactions,” he said. Schweizer conceded that “it’s always hard to look into somebody’s head” and judge whether such a filing omission was a mistake, or an intentional act of deception. “People that defend Jared Kushner could say, ‘Well, look, he’s got a lot of assets, a lot of companies.’ Here’s the problem: it’s hard even with Jared Kushner’s wealth to hide your stake, your involvement, with one billion dollars in loans. So I think this is a massive problem,” he contended.  “I think a couple of things need to happen,” Schweizer suggested. “Number One, Jared Kushner needs to look at who filled out the disclosure forms for him. If he’s saying he had no involvement with lacking this disclosure, somebody needs to be fired. ”  “I think the second question needs to be: what other investments could be out there lurking that we’re not aware of?” he asked. “To be clear, it is a federal penalty, it is a crime, to fail to disclose things on your financial forms. I’m not a lawyer, so I couldn’t speak to this particular case, but these rules and laws have real teeth because they present real problems. ”  “On a scale from 1 to 10, I would put this at a 7,” he concluded, responding to SiriusXM host Alex Marlow’s request to rank the severity of this transparency issue. Marlow referred back to a recent interview he gave to New York Magazine, in which he observed that Kushner rarely grants interviews or issues public statements, so it is difficult to draw conclusions about his agenda, or measure how much influence he truly wields in the Trump White House. “Every president has advisers that have input, that offer insight, but those advisers  —   whether it’s Trump or Obama  —   generally there’s a good public knowledge about them, because they serve them during the campaign. They’ve been public officials, or outspoken on issues in one way or the other,” Schweizer noted. “Jared Kushner has not. During the campaign, he said very, very little publicly. Before that, in terms of his politics or his policy views, very, very hard to discern. And he, in a sense, kind of emerges out of nowhere to become this very powerful figure in the Trump White House. ”  “Now, President Trump certainly has a right to do that,” he allowed. “But I think with that elevation of Jared Kushner needs to come, in a sense, allowing us to lift the hood up from the car and see what kind of engine is underneath there  —   to see really what his views are, have him do some public interviews about what his positions are. ”  Schweizer reiterated that Kushner should expect heightened scrutiny because he is “a liaison with the business community. ”  “He is now the sort of   between President Trump and people like Goldman Sachs   George Soros that might have business in the White House,” he elaborated. “These are people he does business with, and has commingled assets with. The American people need to know, and for a campaign that I think ‘draining the swamp’ and transparency were such important issues, this circumstance I think demands that kind of response. ” Schweizer called for “some sort of an independent audit,” a term he disliked using but found closest to what he envisions. “There needs to be somebody independently that goes in and looks through his assets to make sure that there aren’t other big conflicts that are undisclosed lurking,” he said. “The problem is, you really can’t have confidence in whoever prepared these forms for Jared Kushner because you’ve got these gaps. I would be surprised if there aren’t more of these kinds of mistakes or omissions, because it just seems to me this one is so big and so glaring, it’s hard for me to believe that it was just an oversight, and it’s hard for me to believe that this is the only one that exists. ” Marlow asked if Kushner specifically having ties with Goldman Sachs and George Soros would cause problems with Trump voters, of if such dealings should simply be understood as inescapable aspects of New York City high finance. “I think from the policy standpoint I would have less concern about this, precisely for what you said,” Schweizer replied. “Look, when you’re looking at these large investments where you have very wealthy people or their offices investing,   you find this a fair amount. So I don’t think this necessarily says anything about Jared Kushner’s politics or policy views, the fact that he’s   with George Soros. ” “But I do think, as we talked about earlier, there is this mystery. What actually are his views about crony capitalism?” he continued. “What are his views about the tax rate? What are his views about the   Bank, and those other issues that have been lurking out there for so long?”  “He obviously has an important voice and is going to be a player at the table. People know what everybody else around the table is thinking. People basically know what Gary Cohn thinks. They know what Steve Bannon thinks. People don’t know what Jared Kushner thinks, and I think the American people, particularly the people that have supported him, would expect to know and want to know what those views are,” Schweizer said. He pointed out that Kushner appears to have an extraordinarily broad portfolio in the Trump administration, having turned up in Iraq last month. “Is he a diplomat? Is he a liaison with the business community? Is he doing both of those things? If so, what are his views? Does he have any background or any qualifications in those areas?” Schweizer asked. “I think these are all legitimate questions that people have a right to ask, and to want to know. And yet, it’s kind of shrouded with mystery. ” “I can tell you, if you look through American history, any time there have been family members sort of intermingled with an American presidency  —   whether that’s a Kennedy administration, and Bobby Kennedy is Attorney General, or going back to Woodrow Wilson where he was basically disabled and his wife ran the country  —   this is the lurking concern and fear that people have,” he recalled. “That is, who is actually making the decisions? You really can’t fire a family member per se. They’re going to remain your family member. So it creates a different kind of dynamic and environment, that somebody can’t just be told to go away if they make a massive mistake or engage in destructive behaviors. It presents a unique challenge. ”  “I think that’s why it’s important for the Trump White House to get out in front of his, and this issue of disclosure. This is sort of Clean Government 101,” he said. Schweizer recalled calling out Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager John Podesta for “his failure to disclose his ties to this company that was funded in part by a Russian fund that Vladimir Putin ran. ” “We were right to call him out,” he maintained. “The same thing needs to occur here. This is basic stuff that needs to be done, and the fact that it’s not being done at this point, a hundred days in, is extremely troubling. ” Peter Schweizer is a Breitbart News Senior    president of the Government Accountability Institute, and author of the   book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.

"Labor, abortion rights groups praise Kaine pick "," (CNN) Potential progressive backlash to Tim Kaine was slow to mount Friday evening after Hillary Clinton chose him as her running mate, though a few traditional Democratic interest groups did take shots at him after the selection was made. Kaine is not as liberal as some Democrats would prefer on a range of issues, most prominently trade and abortion rights.  Two major labor groups praised him despite his support for the   Partnership.   President Richard Trumka said Kaine had a ”strong record on workers’ issues” and proclaimed him a ”winner for America.” The SEIU also praised Kaine’s record as well, saying, ”We know what is in Tim Kaine’s heart.” But two other progressive groups, however, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and Democracy for America, took issue with the choice, citing Kaine’s support for the TPP, a massive   Pacific rim trade deal opposed by progressives. ”Since Tim Kaine voted to fast track the   Partnership, Republicans now have a new opening to attack Democrats on this economic populist issue,” the PCCC said in a statement. ”The mood of the country is a populist one. The center of gravity in the Democratic Party has shifted in a bold, populist, progressive direction    regardless of who is selected by Hillary Clinton as vice president.” Democracy for America executive director Charles Chamberlain said Clinton’s choice would present challenges for his group’s advocacy against Donald Trump.   ”Secretary Clinton’s choice of Senator Tim Kaine as her running mate doesn’t change that goal, but Kaine’s support for   authority for the     Partnership and recent backing of bank deregulation will make our work more difficult,” he wrote in a statement.  Two major groups that favor abortion rights chose not to criticize Kaine, with the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws noting his legislative record. ”While Senator Kaine has been open about his personal reservations abut abortion, he’s maintained a 100%   voting record in the US Senate,” the group said in a statement. ”When he was governor, Tim Kaine took positions we disagreed with and actively campaigned against. We’re pleased that since then, his votes and public statements have been consistently in favor of trusting women to make our own decisions.” Planned Parenthood also noted his 100% rating on their scorecard, calling him a ”thoughtful running mate with integrity.” Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar told CNN that she thought Kaine was an excellent choice because of his experience, temperament and bipartisan appeal. ”He’s just someone that Republicans have a lot of respect for,” she told Don Lemon on ”CNN Tonight.” ”He’s someone who takes responsibility for things. You saw that when he was mayor (of Richmond) when he was governor.” Republicans, meanwhile, labeled Kaine a Washington insider. In a fundraising text message to supporters, Trump’s campaign wrote: ”The ultimate insiders    Obama, Hillary and Kaine. Don’t Let Obama have a 3rd Term. Contribute.” The campaign later issued a lengthy statement, labeling the Virginia Democrat ”corrupt Kaine.” ”It’s only fitting that Hillary Clinton would select an ethically challenged insider like Tim Kaine who’s personally benefited from the rigged system,” spokesman Jason Miller said. ”While serving in government, Kaine has taken tens of thousands of dollars in freebies    more than $160, 000 in fact    on free vacations, free clothes, and free tickets. If you think Crooked Hillary and Corrupt Kaine are going to change anything in Washington, it’s just the opposite.” Miller was likely referring to Kaine’s acceptance of more than $160, 000 in gifts during his time as governor, benefiting from Virginia’s loose laws related to political gift giving. There was no accusation, however, that Kaine helped any of his gift givers through his official capacity as governor. Trump himself picked up on that line of attack Friday night, tweeting, ”Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn’t get indicted while Bob M did?” Trump tweeted, referring to Kaine’s successor, Bob McDonnell. Kaine spokeswoman Amy Dudley refuted the allegations of impropriety. ”During his eight years as lieutenant governor and governor, Senator Kaine went beyond the requirements of Virginia law, promptly disclosing any and all gifts received, including those beneath the reporting threshold,” Dudley said in a statement. ”All disclosure information    the vast majority of which was for   travel expenses rather than gifts    has been publicly available for years and never once raised any concerns of impropriety.”   Republicans praise Kaine, Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee tried to stoke tensions between Clinton and the liberal base that initially flocked to Bernie Sanders, saying that Kaine did ”nothing to unify a fractured Democrat base which is repelled by her dishonesty and cronyism.” Two prominent critics of the Trump, though, tweeted some support for their Senate colleague. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican, wrote: ”Trying to count the ways I hate @timkaine. Drawing a blank. Congrats to a good man and a good friend.” And Lindsey Graham, another Trump critic, tweeted: ”I find the VP candidates    Governor Mike Pence and Senator Tim Kaine    more palatable than the presidential nominees.” Even   artist MC Hammer, best known for hit songs ”U Can’t Touch This” and ”2 Legit 2 Quit,” weighed in on the choice. He tweeted Friday, ”Tim Kaine is an excellent choice ! !! Good man. Here with my Brother Raul Fernandez. #ClintonKaine” The tweet included a photo of Kaine with the musician and entrepreneur Raul Fernandez at a Washington Capitals game. Other Clinton VP candidates react, Several other names floated to be Clinton’s running mate praised Clinton’s choice. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker quickly praised Kaine. His first tweet came right after the announcement, when he tweeted, ”KAINE IS ABLE! !!” which is a biblical reference to the story of Cain and Abel.  He added, ”Sincerely, Tim Kaine is 1 of the most honorable men in politics. I admire  am inspired by him, give them your vote.” Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper tweeted congratulations to Kaine. ”Great choice @HillaryClinton. @TimKaine is one of America’s hardest working, optimistic, experienced public servants,” he tweeted. And Labor Secretary Tom Perez told CNN that Kaine is ”a great man.” ”The first conversation I ever had with Tim Kaine was about our shared love of civil rights law and fair housing policy,” he said in a statement. ”He is a great man, he will make an even better vice president, and as a proud progressive, I cannot wait to vote for him in November.”"
"New York bombing: Investigators search for suspects, motive","New York (CNN) A day after a bombing injured 29 people in a New York City neighborhood, surveillance videos show the same man near the site of the explosion and another location where a   device was found four blocks away, multiple local and federal law enforcement sources told CNN. Saturday’s explosion shook New York City’s Chelsea neighborhood, packed with restaurants, subway stations, shops, businesses and art galleries, and sent panicked people scrambling for cover. Police continued to scour the area on Sunday for clues about who was responsible for the explosion and a motive.  A few blocks away from the blast site and shortly after the explosion occurred, investigators found one possible lead: a pressure cooker, with   wiring sticking out, connected by silver duct tape to what appears to be a cellphone, officials said.  Surveillance videos from Saturday shows the same man near both sites, multiple sources told CNN. 3 attacks on US soil, By Sunday morning, 26 people who had been admitted to hospitals were released as city officials appealed to the public for help in finding those responsible. Authorities cordoned off the street where the explosion occurred, south of Midtown in western Manhattan. The blast occurred on the same day an explosion went off near a Marine Corps charity run in New Jersey and a man stabbed nine people at a Minnesota mall, leaving many across the country on edge. Authorities are investigating all three incidents as possible terror acts.  The Department of Homeland Security is actively monitoring and participating in the investigations in New York and New Jersey. Investigators found similarities between the explosives used in both states, according to multiple law enforcement officials, but authorities said they have not concluded the incidents are linked. ”We do not have any specific evidence of a connection, but that will continue to be considered,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said. ”We’re not taking any options off the table.” In New York, law enforcement officials and the mayor said that without knowing who’s responsible or what the motive was, it’s too soon to call the Saturday bombing a terror attack. ”We know it was a very serious incident, but we have a lot more work to do to be able to say what kind of motivation was behind this,” de Blasio told reporters Sunday. ”Was it a political motivation? Was it a personal motivation? We do not know that yet.” Suspicious device found nearby, The blast occurred around 8:30 p. m. at 23rd Street between 6th and 7th Avenues. Investigators believe the blast was caused by an explosive device in or near a dumpster, a law enforcement source told CNN. Four blocks away on 27th Street, a   device was found with a piece of paper with writing on it close by, officials said. Surveillance video shows a man dragging what appears to be a duffel bag with wheels near the site of the West 23rd street explosion about 40 minutes before the blast, according to multiple local and federal law enforcement sources.  About 10 minutes later, surveillance video shows the same man with what appears to be the same duffel bag on West 27th street, multiple law enforcement sources said.  In the video, the man leaves the duffel bag where police later found the unexploded pressure cooker. After he leaves, the video shows two men removing a white garbage bag believed to contain the pressure cooker from the duffel bag and leave it on the sidewalk, according to a senior law enforcement official and another source familiar with the video. Investigators have not determined if those two men are connected to the man with the duffel bag on both streets, the sources said.  The device was transported to the NYPD Bomb Squad facility at Rodman’s Neck Range in the Bronx. NYPD and FBI Bomb technicians rendered the device safe. A forensic examination of the device and its components will be conducted at the FBI Laboratory at Quantico, Virginia. ’I could feel it in my chest’ As investigators combed through surveillance video for clues, police officers and federal agents searched the streets with flashlights, robots and dogs early Sunday to ensure there were no other devices in the area.  Authorities cordoned off the street where the explosion occurred. A small crowd watched from behind police tape Sunday as investigators gathered at the blast site. Some onlookers said residents who live on the block still hadn’t been allowed to return to their homes. Danilo Gabrielli, 50, was watching TV at his 23rd Street apartment about a block away from the explosion site when he heard the blast. He rushed to see what had happened and found a chaotic scene. ”We smelled something, like an intense sulfur smell, and saw smoke coming out of this building. I saw pieces of metal    not large, but not small either. A few friends of mine saw glass there.” Gabrielli said ”the entire neighborhood is real scared.” ”It’s a real quiet neighborhood    not like the center of the city or the Wall Street area. It’s tiny bars, where you go to grab a drink, grab a bite to eat, watch a film. We were worried.” Nearby resident Sam Smith, 50, said he was closing the shades of his apartment when the blast hit. ”All I saw was a big light, and then I heard the explosion,” he told CNN as waited for word about whether he could return home Sunday morning. ”I could feel it in my chest. It took me an hour and a half before I could hear again.” Some social media users said the sound of the explosion was heard as far away as Hoboken, New Jersey, across the Hudson River. ’New York is up and running’ Investigators are still searching the scene for evidence and transporting it to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, for review, FBI Assistant Director in Charge William Sweeney Jr. said Sunday.  Meanwhile, New Yorkers will see an increased police presence around the city, de Blasio said.    security across the city is common as world leaders arrive for the United Nations General Assembly meeting, which is underway. But now it will be even more intense, de Blasio said.  ”You should know you will see a very substantial NYPD presence this week    bigger than ever,” he said. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo added that 1, 000 additional New York State Police officers and National Guard troops will be deployed to patrol bus terminals, airports and subway stations.  The increased policing, Cuomo said, is ”just to err on the side of caution.” ”I want New Yorkers to be confident when they go back to work on Monday that New York is up and running and we’re doing everything that we need to do,” he said."
"Fisherman Faces Life in Prison for Catching $500,000 Worth of Cocaine and Selling It - Breitbart","A commercial fisherman faces life in prison for catching a 45 pound haul of cocaine and selling it instead of turning it over to the authorities. [Thomas Breeding, a    boat captain who has had a history of drug and weapons convictions, was charged with conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance and unlawfully transporting a firearm, the Panama City News Herald reported.  Breeding said he had never been involved in the drug trade before and was “just a   young commercial fisherman. ” Breeding distributed the cocaine to four others who helped him sell the product and then received a cut from the sales.

Nearly 100 migrants missing in Mediterranean," (CNN) Nearly 100 people are missing after a boat carrying migrants wrecked in the waters between Libya and Italy, the International Organization for Migration said Saturday. Rescuers have found eight bodies and only four survivors from the boat, which was carrying 110 people in harsh sea conditions, organization spokesman Flavio Di Giacomo told CNN. Many migrants have died trying to make the perilous trip from North Africa to Europe, with Libya being a popular   point. The crossing through the Central Mediterranean is considered the world’s deadliest migration route.  With too many migrants    some fleeing war or persecution, others seeking a better life    crammed into what are often barely seaworthy boats, the journey can be can be treacherous.  ”Bodies washing up in Libya is something we often see preceded by a large shipwreck in the Central Mediterranean,” Julia Black, who works with the organization’s Missing Migrants Project in Berlin, said earlier this year. 2016 closed out as the deadliest year for migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Europe, the group said. A total of 5, 079 people died or were reported missing in the open waters. More than 380, 000 migrants made the trip to Europe successfully last year, according to the group."

Trump Details MI Devastation Caused by Clinton’s Trade Policies,"“We’re living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world,” Donald Trump told thousands of Michigan voters on Monday. [During his two Monday rallies in the traditionally blue state of Michigan, Trump detailed the devastation its residents have experienced as a result of Hillary   trade deals.  “Hillary got rich selling your jobs  —   the same special interests who pushed the jobs out of America are the people who’ve given countless millions to the Clintons. Hillary gets rich making America poor,” Trump told supporters in Warren, Michigan. He added: Just look at the devastation. Delphi, your area, laid off 3, 627 workers right here in Michigan. Most of those jobs went to Mexico. Benteler automotive laid off 233 Americans and sent those jobs to Mexico. Steelcase laid off 870 workers those jobs went to Mexico and Malaysia. Autodie, once the biggest tool and die maker in the world, laid off 300 workers, getting smaller all the time.   …     Ford laid off 2, 155 workers. Those jobs went to various countries, but they’re going to be going to moving to Mexico more and more and more. Now, Ford is moving all if its small car production. That’s a big deal —  to Mexico. And that’s on top of the [$2. 5 billion] plant.   …      A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America and will stop the jobs from leaving Michigan. During his rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Trump noted that in addition to those jobs: GM laid off 314 workers at the Lake Orion Assembly Plant in 2013 because of imports from the South Korean trade deal pushed through by Hillary Clinton. Lear Corporation laid off another 50 people in Rochester Hills and moved their jobs to South Korea. FTE Automotive laid off 166 people in Auburn Hills. Their jobs went to Mexico. Chrysler laid off over 5, 300 workers. Those jobs went to Mexico, China, India, and other countries. Trump explained that the devastation has been a result of Hillary   policies. Michigan has lost more than one in four  manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA   …     a deal strongly supported by crooked Clinton. Before NAFTA went into effect, there were 280, 000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is down to less than 160, 000 workers and it’s going down fast. Under NAFTA, we eliminated our tariffs on Mexico, but Mexico raised their VAT on us.   …     So when we send products to Mexico, we pay a 17 percent tax.   …     Our trade deficit with China grew almost 40 percent during Hillary’s tenure as secretary of state. Her trade deal with South Korea —   her baby —   killed another 100, 000 American jobs. Trump argued the Hillary   NAFTA was “defective” because it has benefitted Mexico at the expense of American workers —  describing it as a “  highway right into their pockets”: It’s a   highway. They get the jobs. They get the money. They get the factories. We get the drugs. We get the unemployment. We get the losses.   …     That’s not too good. America is running an early $800 billion annual trade deficit.   …     We’re living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Trump pledged that a Trump administration would pursue an “America first” trade policy and would stop the bleeding of American jobs to other countries: “At the core of my contract [with the American voter] is my plan to bring back your jobs,” Trump said, adding: From now on, it’s going to be America first. If Ford or another company announces they want to move their jobs to Mexico or another country, then I will pick up the phone —   even though it’s not very presidential for me to be calling the head of a company, but it’s so easy. I will call the executives   …     [and] tell them that if they want to do that   …     we will charge a 35 percent tax when they try to ship their products back across what will be a very strong border. “It used to be the cars made in Flint, and you couldn’t drink the water in Mexico. Now the cars are made in Mexico, and you can’t drink the water in Flint. But we’re going to turn it all around,” Trump said. He continued: Look at the City of Detroit. It used to be the manufacturing hub of the world. Now, nearly half of Detroit residents do not work. It has the   violent crime rate in the country, and the children are trapped in failing government schools. Yet, as the people of Detroit suffer, Hillary wants to spend trillions of dollars on government benefits for illegal immigrants and refugees. We are going to rebuild Detroit, and we are going to rebuild Michigan. We’re going to bring your jobs back. Trump suggested that it is time for the nation to “close the chapter on the Clintons” and begin focusing on the needs and interests of the American people. “Hillary Clinton put the office of secretary of state up for sale, and if she ever got the chance, she’d put the oval office up for sale, too,” Trump warned. He added: When we close the chapter on the Clintons, we open a bright new chapter focused on the American People. My contract with the American voter begins with a plan to restore honesty and accountability to our government. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we —  not me —  we have to say. When we win on November 8, we are going to Washington, D. C. and we are going to drain the swamp."
Samuel L. Jackson and Others on Black British Actors in American Roles - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   The actor Samuel L. Jackson has sidled into a debate about the roles for black actors on both sides of the Atlantic. In an interview with the radio station Hot 97 posted online on Monday, Mr. Jackson questioned the casting of the black British actor Daniel Kaluuya in the   film “Get Out,” about a black American’s encounter with his white girlfriend’s creepy family. Mr. Jackson suggested that “an American brother” might have brought a deeper perspective to the role, and suggested that black Britons had endured less racism than  . He noted that British actors often secured American roles because they are less well known and therefore paid less, and because many of them are valued for their classical training. Jordan Peele, the writer and director of “Get Out,” has acknowledged that he was hesitant to cast a British actor, given that the film focuses on the   experience. Mr. Jackson said on Wednesday that his intention had been to comment on Hollywood, not to “slam” Mr. Kaluuya. And while his comments have been criticized by many black commentators  —   American and British  —   some British performers do seem to find it easier to get roles in the United States than at home. Here is what some British minority actors who have worked in the United States have said about the issue. Mr. Boyega, who is from South London, plays Finn in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens. ” While the role is not American per se, given that the film unfolds in a distant galaxy, Finn speaks with an entirely convincing American accent. In a tweet on Tuesday, Mr. Boyega appeared to dismiss Mr. Jackson’s comments: “Black brits vs African American,” he wrote, saying that the conflict was “stupid” and one “we don’t have time for. ” It’s not just black British actors who have found success in the United States. Mr. Ahmed, a British actor of Pakistani descent, has slipped into several American roles, including the lead character, Nasir, on HBO’s series “The Night Of,” and a philandering surfing instructor on “Girls,” also on HBO. He recently addressed Parliament about a lack and misrepresentation of minority characters in the arts, suggesting that the problem might even be driving young Britons toward extremist beliefs. “We end up going to America to find work,” Mr. Ahmed said. “I meet with producers and directors here and they say, ‘We don’t have anything for you all our stories are set in Cornwall in the 1600s. ’” Ms. Harris, who plays Paula, the   mother of the lead character, Chiron, in the   “Moonlight,” is from London. She had to film her scenes in the movie in just three days, because of issues securing a visa to the United States. “I definitely think that for my career to have continued I definitely had to go to America, and I’m really glad that I did there is just a lot more material,” Ms. Harris told reporters at the premiere of “Moonlight” at the London Film Festival last year. Mr. Ejiofor portrayed Solomon Northup, a free   who was abducted and enslaved in the   century. He has made an acting career with a foot on both sides of the Atlantic. In a 2015 interview with Time Out, he seemed to shy from discussion of the role race had played in his career, but suggested that the notable success that British actors of all races have enjoyed in the United States may have to do with different career expectations. “We all wanted to be theater actors,” he said of his fellow Britons. “It’s less glamorous much more about the work. You have to get on with it. You have to know when something’s not working. And you have to hone your craft. Maybe that gives us an advantage. ” Mr. Oyelowo, who is based in the United States, toiled in smaller roles before landing the part of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the 2014   drama “Selma. ” In a speech on diversity in London last year, Mr. Oyelowo pleaded with members of the British film industry to create more roles for minorities in Britain, noting that many actors felt obliged to move to the United States. “Please stop this talent drain,” he said. “You have to change the demographics of the people who are making these decisions. ” Mr. Elba grew up in London and broke into the American market with his starring role as the Baltimore drug lord Stringer Bell on HBO’s “The Wire. ” In an address to Parliament last year, Mr. Elba called on media representatives to make more room for minorities. “The Britain I come from is the most successful, diverse, multicultural country on Earth,” Mr. Elba said. “But here’s my point: You wouldn’t know it if you turned on the TV. ” Sophie Okonedo described herself as a Jewish, Nigerian Brit when accepting her 2014 Tony Award for playing the   character Ruth Winger in “A Raisin in the Sun” on Broadway. She told The Guardian in 2014 that she saw far more opportunities for roles in the United States than in Britain. “I do notice that  —   over the last year  —   I’ve had maybe two scripts from England and tens and tens from America,” she said. “The balance is ridiculous. ”"
Canada Takes Down ’Known Wolf’ Islamic State Jihadi,"Working on a tip from the American FBI, Canada’s Royal Canadian Mounted Police moved against    Aaron Driver, an Islamic State supporter, and killed him after a tense standoff on Wednesday, before Driver could carry out a planned suicide bomb attack. [Reuters reports the raid was conducted in the small Ontario town of Strathroy, 140 miles south of Toronto. When the police confronted Driver, he detonated an explosive device, injuring himself and another person.  “I hear a bomb sound, like a ‘bang’  —   I was freaking out because this is a small and quiet town,” said eyewitness Irene Lee. “All of a sudden the policemen were yelling, ‘everyone get into your houses. ’” According to The Sun, the other person injured in the explosion was a taxi driver. Driver was shot dead by the RCMP after setting off the bomb. The Globe and Mail says Driver planned to take the taxi to a shopping mall in nearby London, Ontario. A CBC report adds that police informed Driver’s family that he “had another device, and planned to detonate it,” presumably in a suicide attack at the shopping mall. The FBI tip to Canadian authorities concerned an imminent “  attack in a major Canadian city. ” Driver was a perfect example of the “known wolf” jihadi, an individual who was very much on law enforcement’s radar screen, long before he attempted to murder innocents in the name of the Islamic State. A Muslim convert who sometimes used the alias Harun Abdulrahman, Driver was “under a court order from earlier this year to not associate with any terrorist organization, including ISIS,” as NBC News puts it. “In February, Driver’s lawyer and the prosecutor agreed to a peace bond stating there are ‘reasonable grounds to fear that he may participate, contribute directly or indirectly in the activity of a terrorist group,’” NBC adds. In Canada, a “peace bond” is essentially a form of extended probation  —   the signatory promises to “keep the peace” for a period of up to one year, or face criminal charges. “Obtaining a peace bond may take several weeks or even months, so peace bonds do not deal with emergencies. In an emergency, call 911,” Canada’s Department of Justice helpfully suggests. One such emergency would be when a jihadi is able to build multiple bombs, in spite of being theoretically under   surveillance because he’s a known terrorist sympathizer. According to the Globe and Mail, the conditions of Driver’s peace bond included “wearing a GPS tracking device, not using the Internet or having any communication with Islamic State, including not having any object on his person that bore an Islamic State logo. ” That would make him the second jihadi to carry out a violent attack while wearing a GPS tracker in the past month. “The restrictions drew criticism from civil liberties activists in Manitoba,” adds the Globe and Mail. The lawyer who helped him work out that peace bond, Leonard Tailleur, said he was “shocked” and “saddened to hear that it had to end this way for him. ” Perhaps Tailleur would be a bit less shocked if he studied the statements that brought Driver to the attention of police. In June 2015, he gave CBC a   interview in which he defended terrorist attacks against Canadian civilians by Islamists, and specifically stated that “when it does happen, they shouldn’t act surprised,” because “they had it coming to them, they deserved it. ” The reason CBC wanted to interview Driver for 90 minutes is that he was arrested by the RCMP, which confiscated his “  computer, phone, flash drives, and Koran,” because he had been posting   holy warrior messages on social media, justifying the terrorist murder of soldiers and police officers. The Globe and Mail notes that under his Harun Abdulrahman name, Driver had a “network of friends and followers who consisted mainly of British Muslims fighting for the Islamic State on the ground or online. ” “I think the big issue is I’m a Canadian living in Canada, and I’m OK with soldiers or police officers being targeted for what they’re doing to Muslims,” he said, correctly identifying something that should have been an even bigger issue with the authorities. “I think it’s a little hypocritical that people would take issue with people retaliating against them  …     when it’s the police and the military who are killing Muslims. ” He said that after he was arrested, the police kept asking him about Twitter messages from ISIS fighters and recruiters he had retweeted. “Driver doesn’t remember the exact motivation behind the retweet, but said he believes he found it funny at the time,” wrote CBC. In that lengthy interview, Driver said he got into some trouble as a teenager, but decided to straighten up his act at 17, when his girlfriend got pregnant. Since he came from a Christian family, he tried reading the Bible, but said he “just decided it couldn’t possibly be the word of God. ” “I started watching debates to find some answers. A lot of debates between Christians and atheists and Christians and Muslims, and the Muslims were always destroying them in these debates,” Driver said, further explaining that he became radicalized because of Western powers killing Muslims in the Middle East. He said he might be willing to give up his radical views if the West stopped killing, bombing, and arresting Muslims, and if Western nations “take responsibility for the crimes they’ve committed and just stay home and work on their own problems. ” Then he told Canadian authorities he wasn’t a threat, and they believed him. CBC quotes people who lived near Driver complaining that they weren’t told he was a terrorism suspect. “I think they should have, just so that we’re well aware of this, so that we can keep an eye out ourselves too. We should have the right to know. I’m pretty sure they had close tabs on this guy  …     but living beside him, I would feel not safe,” said one neighbor."
Andrew Walther: Obama Administration Allowed ISIS Dechristianization in Syria and Iraq,"Andrew Walther, vice president of communications for the Knights of Columbus  —   the world’s largest Catholic fraternal order  —   joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow for a special edition of Breitbart News Daily live from the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) to discuss his   calling for Christian refugees from the Islamic State (ISIS) to be given priority consideration. [“I’ve been over to Iraq twice in the last year, the last time with Congressman Chris Smith, taking a look at how Christians were being overlooked by the aid program of the U. S. government, getting basically no money from the U. S. or the UN,” Walther said.  LISTEN: “What we’ve discovered and been advocating against at this point is that these people are really being left out,” he said. “ISIS came in, killed a lot of them, drove them all from their homes in Nineveh and elsewhere. The upshot of that was the U. S. just sort of stood by, did not have a plan for helping communities. ”  “Now I think we have the opportunity to change things,” said Walther. “These people faced genocide once, then they faced the sort of overlooking by the U. S. and now I’m told that there are signs that things are starting to change  —   that there’s a new openness among government officials there in Iraq, U. S. government officials, to helping these communities that have been overlooked for so long. ”  “How this happened was simply a matter of an argument that we have to take care of everybody, so all the money goes to the big camps,” he explained. “Christians don’t go to the big camps because, of course, they get persecuted and targeted for violence at the big camps, and so, as a result, they get nothing because there’s no thought about prioritizing, or even helping, or making sure that you don’t leave out these little communities that could disappear. In the case of Christians, their numbers have declined in Iraq by almost 90 percent in the last decade. ” Walther said he found some of the reactions to President Trump’s executive order on immigration “very confusing. ” “The idea that we would prioritize people for religious persecution  —   people who had suffered, in the case of several of these countries, genocide  —   and it was religious minorities in general, let’s be clear: It wasn’t just Christians. Yazidis, Mandaeans, Shabak  —   I mean, there were a lot of people that were targeted like this. When you look at that, and you see this reaction, you have to wonder if these people have missed the history lesson on what the U. S. has done for the past hundred years,” he said.  “After World War I, we prioritized the Christian community in the Middle East because it was almost completely destroyed by the Ottoman genocide of 1915 and ’16 and again in ’22. It was the U. S. that stepped in,   partnerships, the State Department was involved, the whole bit,” Walther explained.  “Second, after World War II, the U. S. takes an enormous number of Jewish refugees from Europe. Why? Not because there weren’t as many or more refugees from the German, French, and Italian populations, but because everybody understood that they had faced genocide, and they needed a special kind of priority. That didn’t mean that other refugees didn’t get in. It just meant that the Jewish refugees  —   and you can see this in the numbers  —   got some priority,” he said.  “Even more recently, you’ve had Democratic sponsorship of things like the Lautenberg Amendment, which prioritizes religious minorities from Iran, which are Christians, Jews, and those of the Baha’i faith,” he noted. “Suddenly, we have an executive order that says we’re going to prioritize religious minorities, and it’s the end of the world. I really don’t understand why that is, and I don’t understand why people don’t understand that this has been the U. S. policy for a very long time. ” Marlow quoted from Walther’s   a passage in which he noted that only   of one percent of Syrian refugees admitted into the U. S. in 2016 were Christians, even though they make up ten percent of the Syrian population. “Certainly, it’s a de facto inequity, and I think you’ve seen a lot of the    —   I was looking at one this morning  —   that are making the case that refugees from other countries are getting in at a greater rate. Christians are getting in from Iran, Iraq, and these other places, so what the president said about Syria is wrong,” said Walther.  “No, what the president said about Syria is actually right. It has been very hard for Christians to get in,” he argued. “A lot of people are saying that it’s not really discrimination they don’t want to come in. I got an email two days ago from the Syriac Catholic patriarch, who I would imagine knows what’s going on with his people, who tells me they do want to get in. They’re applying for refugee status, and they never hear back from places like the U. S. and Canada. They’re ignored, or they’re rejected. So which is it? I’ve got to believe that he knows what he’s talking about. ”  “I was with the archbishop of Aleppo two years ago. He stood on our stage, and he said, ‘What’s happening, in terms of the refugee system, is unjust.’ I think these guys who are living in places like Aleppo know what’s going on,” he said. Walther was confident the CPAC audience understands “the importance of protecting religious minorities around the world, the importance of human rights” and that “threats to human rights can have a religious nature. ” “I think that people here also, you see there is support in the polling, and there is support in general, I think especially in groups like this, for making sure that we don’t overlook these minorities in the Middle East,” he added. Marlow asked if the Knights of Columbus have experienced any decline in membership or influence due to the “secularization of America. ” “No, we have found a consistent way to grow for   years,” Walther replied. “The fact of the matter is that I think people get excited about the kinds of things we do. They get excited about the work we do on the   issue. They get excited about the work that we do in communities around the country to help our neighbors. They get excited about issues like helping Christians in the Middle East. The persecution of Christians in the Middle East gets our guys fired up. ” “We’ve raised more than $12 million for these people on this issue,” he announced. “I think we have a very strong network in the U. S. and also internationally, of guys that are really committed to their faith and also to helping in a variety of ways. ” When Marlow asked how much of a setback the eight years of Obama were for the cause of helping persecuted Christians in the Middle East, Walther cited criticism from his friend the Archbishop of Erbil that “it was a mistake for your country to come here in 2003, and it was a bigger mistake for you to leave in 2011. ” “He’s the guy taking care of 100, 000 Christians in Erbil,” he noted. “You have a situation where once this happened in 2014, once ISIS rolled through, the U. S. basically did nothing for these minority communities. We let them die. We let the ISIS program of dechristianization and sort of radicalizing of the region just occur without any kind of input. We let the Yazidis go. We let the Mandeans go. All of these little groups that have been there for thousands of years were not prioritized, were not even paid attention to. This was a story that I heard over and over there. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. Listen to the full interview audio above."
Trump’s first days in office spawn dozens of lawsuits," (CNN) Donald Trump the businessman was no stranger to lawsuits, both frivolous and substantive.  The   wheeler and dealer filed numerous lawsuits and faced an array of allegations of his own before stepping into the Oval Office, including claims of sexual harassment, bilking investors and defrauding students of his eponymous university.  Donald Trump the president has continued that legal legacy, as it were.  In his first 11 days at the country’s helm, his travel ban and perceived conflicts of interest have spawned a handful of lawsuits, with plaintiffs contending the President of the United States should not be barring certain immigrants from entering the country and that his enterprises around the globe should not be accepting business from foreign governments.  Trump and his representatives have repeatedly defended the travel ban and dismissed concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Earlier this month Trump said he would transfer his business holdings to a trust run by his sons. As of midday Tuesday, Trump has been named in 42 federal lawsuits since his inauguration. By comparison, former President Barack Obama was named in 11 suits during his first 11 days in office    some of them involving the   ”birther” claims that Obama was not an American citizen.  Here’s a look at some of the lawsuits from the opening days of Trump’s presidency.  Darweesh v. Trump, Hameed Khalid Darweesh worked with the American government for 10 years after the United States invaded Iraq. Another Iraqi, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, had been granted a visa to join his wife, who worked for an American contractor in Iraq, and son, 7, both of whom already live in the United States as refugees.  The two men were detained Saturday at John F. Kennedy International Airport, setting off a large protest.  The ACLU and other groups filed a   lawsuit    the first to challenge Trump’s executive order on immigration    on behalf of the men. Separately, the Pentagon is compiling names of people who supported US military operations in Iraq so they can more easily receive waivers under Trump’s executive order on immigration, Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said. Read the court documents  CAIR’s lawsuit, The Council on American Islamic Relations on Monday filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on behalf of 27 named and unnamed individuals challenging what the Muslim civil rights organization terms Trump’s ”Muslim ban.” It targets Trump, Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, the State Department and the Director of National Intelligence.  The White House has repeatedly said its travel ban is not based on religion and Trump has chastised the media for reporting otherwise. But CAIR alleges that the ”underlying motive” of Trump’s executive order is to ban people of the Islamic faith from entering the country.  ”There is no evidence that refugees    the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation    are a threat to national security,” Lena Masri, CAIR’s national litigation director, said in a statement. ”This is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.” Read the CAIR lawsuit, Suit for those who never left for US, The Arab American Civil Rights League filed suit on behalf of six people who were not allowed to get on a plane back to the United States.  ”This is addressing those individuals that are stuck overseas, that cannot be with their loved ones,” attorney Nabih Ayad, founder of the ACRL, said at a news conference. The organization said the six people live in the Detroit area. The suit also was filed on behalf of people in similar situations. ”Plaintiffs file this present suit due to the fact that the existing  orders do not encompass green card holders that were not en route or detained by the United States,” the lawsuit says.  Read the ACRL lawsuit, Another case in Virginia, A federal court issued a temporary restraining order saying that 50 to 60 permanent residents returning from trips abroad should have access to lawyers while they are being detained at Dulles International Airport and that these people cannot be removed from the United States for seven days. The motion for the restraining order, filed on behalf of brothers Tareq Aqel Mohammed Aziz and Ammar Aqel Mohammed Aziz, said that without counsel the detainees could not meaningfully understand their rights and obligations.  There also ”exists the risk that petitioners have credible fears regarding a removal from the United States, should any petitioner be sent to a country where he or she has previously been the subject to or threatened with persecution,” the lawsuit said.  Read the motion for the restraining order, Emoluments Clause, Just three days after Trump took office, the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington sued the President, alleging that Trump violated the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution.  CREW alleges in the suit filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York that the clause prohibits Trump from accepting anything of value from foreign governments, via his myriad business ventures overseas.  Experts differ on whether the case is a viable one, and Trump lawyer Sheri Dillon said earlier this month that the Constitution’s framers never considered ”that paying your hotel bill was an emolument.”  Also, the US Supreme Court has has ruled that to sue in federal court, plaintiffs must prove a concrete and particularized injury. CREW has said that Trump is forcing it to ”divert essential and limited sources” from its government watchdog role, forcing the organization to litigate the matter and educate the public unless a court stops him.  In a column for The New York Times this week, Norman Eisen and Richard Painter    former White House ethics lawyers who now serve, respectively, as CREW’s chairman and vice chairman    linked the emoluments case to the travel ban. The seven countries affected by the travel ban are areas where the President has done business in his previous life, they said.  But he omitted Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Turkey, India and the Philippines    countries Eisen and Painter contend have and do pose terror threats to the US. San Francisco sanctuary city, San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera filed suit Tuesday against the Trump administration over the President’s order targeting sanctuary cities. The White House has threatened to withhold federal grants from any ”jurisdictions” that protect undocumented immigrants and decline to prosecute them for violating immigration laws.  ”The president’s executive order is not only unconstitutional, it’s ” Herrera said in a statement. ”That is why we must stand up and oppose it. We are a nation of immigrants and a land of laws. We must be the ’guardians of our democracy’ that President Obama urged us all to be in his farewell address.” ”Sanctuary cities have less crime, fewer people in poverty and lower unemployment than other counties,” he said, citing a University of California, San Diego study. Herrera accuses Trump of exceeding his authority, and his lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of the presidential order and requests a finding that San Francisco is complying with federal law.  Read Herrera’s lawsuit, Texas, Labeeb Ibrahim Issa worked for the US Army in Iraq as a driver and general maintenance worker when he was injured in 2016 after being targeted for his work helping the US, according to a lawsuit filed on his behalf in US District Court for the Northern District of Texas on Tuesday. As a result of the attack, he broke his pelvis and was left confined to a wheelchair to be able to move.  Because of threats related to his association with the US Army, Issa sought a special immigrant visa on January 13 and demonstrated the ongoing threat he was experiencing, according to court documents. He was granted the visa, which required that the United States confirm he poses no security threat to the country, the lawsuit states.  Issa left Iraq, flying from Baghdad to Qatar, with plans of then traveling to the United States. In Qatar, however, he was told he would be sent back to Iraq due to Trump’s travel ban, the lawsuit states. Later, Issa was told he could enter the United States after all, the lawsuit states.  On January 30, Issa arrived at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport and was held by customs officials for 14 hours before an attorney could request an emergency hearing to have him released, according to the lawsuit. He was released 30 minutes later, his lawyers tell CNN.  Read Issa’s lawsuit, Washington state, ”No one is above the law  —   not even the President,” state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in filing a motion for a restraining order to halt Trump’s executive order.  This was in addition to a complaint alleging that Trump’s order is ”separating Washington families, harming thousands of Washington residents, damaging Washington’s economy, hurting   companies, and undermining Washington’s sovereign interest in remaining a welcoming place for immigrants and refugees.” The attorney general says the travel ban violates the Constitution’s First Amendment and Equal Protection guarantee, and it ”contravenes the federal Immigration and Nationality Act.” A federal court has issued a stay forbidding travelers detained in Washington from being sent back to their home countries.  Read the Washington complaint, Pennsylvania, Three families denied entry to the United States at Philadelphia International Airport over the weekend plan to file two federal lawsuits against the Trump administration asking that family members be admitted into the country, according to the ACLU’s Philadelphia chapter. At least one suit will be filed Tuesday in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, lawyers said.  In one case, when family members of legal US citizens Sarmad and Sarah Asali arrived in Philadelphia from Doha, Qatar, they were told they could have their visas revoked or return on the next flight to Doha.  The Asalis told CNN their family members    who are Christian Orthodox, one of the most persecuted groups in Syria    don’t speak English well and were returned to Qatar.  ”I want my family here and safe regardless of what it takes,” Sarmad Asali told CNN. Added Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney in a statement, ”The Trump administration very well may have just given these families a death sentence.” In another Pennsylvania case, an Iranian mother with a visa and two daughters studying for their doctorates in the United States experienced a similar situation and was sent back to Iran within two hours of her arrival, the ACLU says. Read the Asali family’s complaint, Vayeghan v. Kelly, Ali Khoshbakhti Vayeghan filed a motion in a California federal court for a temporary restraining order so that he could be released from Department of Homeland Security custody Saturday. Before a court could rule, according to court documents, it was ordered that Vayeghan be returned to Iran, via Dubai.  Vayeghan sued, requesting that he be allowed to return to the United States under the terms of his previously approved visa. A federal judge granted his request, demanding that the court’s order be immediately communicated to officers in Dubai who are holding Vayeghan. US District Judge Dolly Gee gave the government until Friday to file its opposition and ordered a hearing next week.  Read Gee’s ruling, Massachusetts  After the ACLU filed a lawsuit Sunday demanding the release of two University of   associate professors    Iranian nationals who are permanent residents of the United States    federal judges in Boston ruled Sunday that officials could not detain someone on the basis of Trump’s travel ban. The professors, who both earned PhDs at Johns Hopkins University, were returning from an engineering conference.  On Tuesday, state Attorney General Maura Healey said she is filing intervention papers in federal court challenging the executive order.  ”The executive order is harmful, discriminatory, and unconstitutional,” Healey said at a press conference Tuesday.  ”It discriminates on the basis of religion and national origin, denies our residents access to due process and equal protection of the law, and violates federal immigration law.” Read the Massachusetts lawsuit, New York, A federal judge in New York blocked part of the executive order Saturday, ruling that authorities could not remove individuals from seven   countries who had arrived in US airports with valid visas. It also ordered that a list of detainees be provided to the ACLU, but no list was provided.  State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman asked for a list as well, as well as assurances that the Department of Homeland Security and US Customs and Border Protection were complying with the judge’s order. On Monday, his office issued a statement: ”DHS has said that it will comply with the federal court orders. However, we continue to press both DHS and CBP to provide a full list of those who are currently detained and allow them access to legal service providers.”  On Tuesday, Schneiderman said his office would join a federal lawsuit, filed by the ACLU, the National Immigration Law Center and others, challenging the travel ban. Schneiderman called the ban unlawful and vowed to ”protect the families caught in the chaos sown by President Trump’s hasty and irresponsible implementation.”"
Eleven States Sue Obama: Transgender Demands Unconstitutional - Breitbart,"Eleven states —  led by Texas —  filed a federal lawsuit today, arguing that the Obama administration’s redefining “sex” to include gender identity —  and threatening to sue and strip funding from states and schools that refuse to go along —  violates both federal law and the U. S. Constitution. [In public letters, agency documents, and a federal lawsuit filed earlier this month, the U. S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and U. S. Department of Education declare that any school that does not allow boys and girls to use whichever bathroom, locker room, and shower facility they claim to “identify” with thereby violates Title IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and can be stripped of all federal funding.  In other words, if a    boy says that he now identifies as a girl  —   and wants to use his high school girls’ shower at the same time that a    girl is showering in that same shower room  —   and the school does not allow the boy to share the shower with the girl, then the federal government can strip that high school of federal funding. More broadly than that, the Obama administration says that any employer who does not treat an employee as a member of whatever sex the employee claims to identify with  —   including calling the employee “he” or “she” in accordance with the employee’s gender identity  —   that employer is engaging in sex discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Today, these states  —   along with several education departments and local school districts  —   filed suit in U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Spearheaded by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, the lawsuit alleges ten counts of illegal activity, including violations of the Tenth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment of the U. S. Constitution, as well as multiple federal statutes. In paragraph 87, the lawsuit’s civil complaint explains: The text employed by Congress does not support the term “sex” as anything other than one’s immutable, biological sex as determined by birth. Rather, Congress expressed its intent to cover “gender identity,” as a protected class, in other pieces of legislation. See, e. g. 18 U. S. C. § 249( a)(2)(A) 42 U. S. C. § 13925( b)(13)(A). In those pieces of legislation, Congress includes “gender identity” along with “sex,” thus evidencing its intent for “sex” to retain its original and only meaning —  one’s immutable, biological sex as determined at birth. The lawsuit seeks a judicial declaration that the Obama administration’s ordering states and employers to reject a worldwide   definition of “sex” is illegal, invalidating the federal rules and guidance documents that demand this redefinition, and stopping the federal government from withholding funding or initiating lawsuits to enforce its novel definition. The plaintiffs also highlight what they regard as liberal hypocrisy on this issue. In paragraph 24, the complaint quotes a 1975 Washington Post editorial from Ruth Bader Ginsburg —  who at the time was a law professor at Columbia Law School —  where Ginsburg asserted, “Separate places to disrobe, sleep, [and] perform personal bodily functions are permitted, [and] in some cases required, by regard for individual privacy. ” Ironically, there is one argument the Obama administration’s lawyers could make to try convincing the district court to dismiss this case, but it is an argument they cannot make without torpedoing their own agenda. DOJ lawyers could assert that the administration’s letters and guidance documents do not carry any inherent force of law, and therefore are not federal regulations or governmental actions over which the states or schools could sue. If so, the case must be dismissed. However, in doing so the Obama administration would announce to the nation that everyone could ignore the White House’s crusade to push a new sexual orthodoxy. Everyone would ignore the administration’s new transgender position, and every federal court could then hold that the administration is “judicially estopped” from bringing any lawsuits to force compliance, as DOJ recently did in North Carolina. The case is Texas v. United States.           (function()  )()         Ken Klukowski is legal editor for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter @kenklukowski."
Lawyer for Melania Trump Threatens Defamation Suits Against News Outlets - The New York Times,"A lawyer for Melania Trump said Monday that he had informed several news organizations, including The Daily Mail, that they could face legal action for publishing articles that Ms. Trump contended were defamatory. In an email, the lawyer, Charles J. Harder, said Ms. Trump, the wife of Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, “has placed several news organizations on notice of her legal claims against them, including Daily Mail among others, for making false and defamatory statements about her supposedly having been an ‘escort’ in the 1990s. ” “All such statements are 100 percent false, highly damaging to her reputation, and personally hurtful,” Mr. Harder added. “She understands that news media have certain leeway in a presidential campaign, but outright lying about her in this way exceeds all bounds of appropriate news reporting and human decency. ” He said no suit had been filed, but added, “That may change. ” The Daily Mail, a British tabloid, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Harder represented the former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan in the    lawsuit against Gawker Media that ultimately resulted in Gawker’s filing for bankruptcy. Peter Thiel, the billionaire Silicon Valley entrepreneur who spoke in July at the Republican National Convention, acknowledged in May that he had secretly funded the Hogan case and others against Gawker. Among the news outlets that Mr. Harder said had been sent notices were Inquisitr (which apologized to Ms. Trump and retracted an article about her that was published within the last week) Politico and Liberal America. Politico declined to comment. Reached by telephone, Tiffany Willis, the founder and editor in chief of Liberal America, said her publication received an emailed letter from Mr. Harder. In the email, a copy of which is posted on the publication’s website, Mr. Harder listed several statements he claimed were defamatory and demanded that the publication “immediately and permanently remove each of these statements from the story, and print a full and complete retraction and apology, with as prominent placement as the original story. ” “Failure to do so,” Mr. Harder added, “will leave my client with no alternative but to institute immediate legal proceedings against you and, should that occur, she would pursue all available causes of action and seek all available legal remedies to the maximum extent permitted by law. ”"
EXCLUSIVE – Ex-Gitmo Warden ‘Infuriated’ by Obama’s Orlando Remarks: ’Nothing About Islamic Terrorism’ - Breitbart,"During an interview Sunday, Col. Michael Bumgarner, formerly the commander of the guard force at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, stated that Gitmo is more important than ever in the wake of Sunday’s terrorist shooting in Orlando. [Bumgarner said he was personally infuriated by President Obama’s official response to Sunday’s attacks, in which Obama did not mention Islam, referred to the carnage as “an act of terror and an act of hate,” and used the occasion to imply that more gun control should be pushed.  “Frankly, it infuriates me,” Bumgarner stated of the speech.  “It’s a continuation of what we have seen through the administration. It’s just hatred that motivates this act? It’s not hatred. It’s a motivation inspired from radical Islamic terrorism  …     “Clearly there’s a linkage to ISIS. Clearly there is a linkage to Islamic terrorism. But in just the few brief words he gave, it’s all about guns and weapons in the U. S. It’s nothing about Islamic terrorism. ” Bumgarner slammed what he described as Obama’s approach to fighting terrorism, and warned, “If we don’t wake up very, very soon, the carnage that we have seen today will continue. ” He stated: The focus is how do we appease the Islamic groups that are against the United States, such as closing Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  He always speaks of and his experts always speak of this is what’s causing the great wave of terror acts in the U. S. and around the world. Closing Guantanamo. That it’s a recruitment tool. You know, in none of these acts that we’ve seen or heard of, be it San Bernardino, be it Chattanooga, be it Paris, be it Brussels, be it Boston, I haven’t heard any mention of Guantanamo.  So this false linkage, it infuriates me that we go down the rabbit trails the other way. It’s got nothing to do with gun control in the U. S.  It’s got nothing to do with Guantanamo. This is a Caliphate that has been established and it’s just following from the normal Islamic doctrine, if you will. Bumgarner told this reporter that Gitmo should remain open to house the remaining nearly 80 detainees, and it should be used as an interrogation center to garner intelligence from a whole new crop of captured jihadists. What is key in this fight is intelligence and that is really what Guantanamo was about and remains about. Not necessarily about the   individuals that remain there now. But it is the place that can be used to pick people up off the battlefield and bring them to where we can gather intelligence. That is how you get in front of these acts of terrorism. You must get inside the mind. You must gather the data. It’s got to be more than the metadata collection from the NSA, where we can’t connect the dots until the aftermath. We’ve just got to get more proactive. Bumgarner served from April 2005 through June 2006 as commander of the Joint Detention Group, the guard force component of the Joint Task Force at the U. S. prison in Guantanamo. Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

She and Seacrest would take turns reading sentences from the story. After reading the line, “The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,” she told the kids, “I think St. Nick gave up smoking. This was a long time back,” according to CNS News. In 2011, the first lady said her husband, President Barack Obama  —   who has been a smoker for several years  —   had quit smoking for good in 2011. This statement was followed up, in 2013, with Obama telling a United Nations official into a hot mic that he hadn’t had a cigarette in “probably six years” because “I’m scared of my wife. ” Seacrest reportedly echoed the first lady’s sentiment and throwback to the past saying, “This was written way back in the day. ” Then, Seacrest read the line about Santa’s “little round belly that shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly,” which he followed up with, “I mean this as a compliment,” before reading the line, “He was chubby and plump (laughter)  —   a right jolly old elf, and I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself. ” The visit to the children’s hospital is just one of many appearances Michelle Obama has made and will make over the holiday season and leading up to her husband’s transition of power to   Donald Trump. During a   interview with Oprah Winfrey to air on CBS Monday at 8 p. m. Michelle expressed that she felt that the “hope” her husband had campaigned on has been lost with the new Donald Trump White House. “We feel the difference now. See, now, we are feeling what not having hope feels like,” she said, according to the New York Post. She added, “Hey, it’s going to be OK. Let’s remember the good things that we have. ” Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz"
Phil Mickelson Comes Close to a Record by Shooting 63 at the British Open - The New York Times,"TROON, Scotland  —   It was in. It was in off the putter, it was in 10 feet from the hole, it was in 5 feet from the hole, it was in as it approached the lip. It was in. Phil Mickelson had never been more sure of anything. He had prowled this putt, stalked this putt, talked to his caddie about this putt and, just before he settled over it, imagined this putt that would track perfectly toward the cup and give him a place in golf history as the first player to shoot a 62 during a major tournament. It was in. Mickelson watched his   on the 18th hole at Royal Troon on Thursday roll toward the hole. He felt the adrenaline surge through his body. He felt joy and pride and bliss. He felt the glow of sporting immortality wash over him. It was in. Except then it wasn’t. “I want to cry,” Mickelson said afterward. Technically, what happened is called a  . Mickelson’s putt skimmed off the edge of the cup and spun around it like a car going into a Scottish roundabout. That label, though, undersells what took place here in the cool breeze of early evening. Mickelson’s putt was not going too fast, as many   are, powering around the circumference of the hole. His read was not off track. Mickelson’s line was straight, his speed was true. Yet somehow, some way, the ball stayed up. “I don’t know how that putt didn’t go in,” said Ernie Els, who was playing in Mickelson’s group. No one did. But instead of becoming the first player to shoot a 62 in a major, Mickelson  —   after cradling his head in his hands and staring in disbelief for what felt like hours  —   tapped in from the lip and settled for recording the 28th score of 63 in a major tournament, good enough for a   lead after the opening round of the British Open. Patrick Reed and Martin Kaymer are tied for second after they each posted a    66. Eight players, including one younger American (Justin Thomas, 23) and one older American (Steve Stricker, 49) are at 67. Ten players, including one British favorite (England’s Justin Rose) and one Spanish star who has never won a major (Sergio García, 0 for 71) are at 68. Rory McIlroy, the   major champion from Northern Ireland, is among a group that shot 69. Many of the players took advantage of a    —   some   locals might even call it unreasonably lovely  —   day on the west coast of Scotland, particularly on Troon’s more forgiving front nine. Colin Montgomerie, the Scot who is an honorary member of Troon and hit the first shot of the tournament at 6:35 a. m. on Thursday, said the conditions were bizarrely placid and rated them as no harder than a 3 out of 10. Friday is expected to bring more traditional British Open weather: soaking rain and blistering wind. But for one day, this Open felt more like California than Carnoustie. Players worked the ball left and right, and were aggressive around the greens. The deep pot bunkers remained the biggest obstacles  —   and they claimed their share of victims, including Montgomerie, who needed two shots to extricate himself from one on the first hole  —   yet there was little carnage. Thomas and Reed were emblematic of those who had success early in the day, opening strong  —   both shot 31 on the front nine, and Thomas had birdies on his first four holes  —   before navigating the back nine cautiously to record a good score. Neither has much experience near the top of the leaderboard in a major tournament, but Thomas can certainly ask his housemates about dealing with the pressure. He is sharing a place this week with Jordan Spieth, Zach Johnson (two major titles apiece) and Jason Dufner (one) as well as Rickie Fowler (top five in all four majors in 2014) and Jimmy Walker. The group prepared for the opening round by engaging in a spirited game of backyard baseball on Wednesday  —   Dufner was said to be the most powerful batter  —   and it clearly left them in a good frame of mind: Johnson shot 67, Fowler shot 69, Dufner and Spieth both had 71 and Walker shot 72. “A little frat house we have this week,” Thomas said. “It was fun. ” Thomas and Reed were long off the course by the time Mickelson made his way toward the clubhouse near 6 p. m. Mickelson, 46, has won more than 50 tournaments, including five majors, but none since the Open at Muirfield in 2013. Known for his sweeping   swing and wizardry around the greens, he has been plagued by inconsistency at this stage of his professional life. Putting together four successful rounds has become a significant hurdle. At a minimum, he now has one. Mickelson shredded Troon on Thursday, recording eight birdies against zero bogeys in a round that was nearly flawless. While most players are discomfited by the wind on Troon’s inward nine holes, Mickelson, as a   said he actually prefers that wind, which comes in from the left off the Firth of Clyde. It showed. He shot 31 on the back, two shots better than anyone else in the top 20, and birdied the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, 10th, 14th, 16th and 17th holes. Mickelson said he began thinking seriously about a possible 62 only after No. 17, a treacherous   where he whipped a   onto the green and rolled in his putt. On the 18th tee, Mickelson took his   instead of his driver, wanting to lay back from some dangerous bunkers. His shot nicked the edge of a bunker anyway but stayed out, and his   approach from about 175 yards spun to a stop a little more than five strides from the hole. Mickelson had missed momentous putts before (a   on a putt for 59 at a PGA Tour event in 2013) and made momentous putts before (the   that rolled around and in to give him the Masters title in 2004) but this was different. Others have shot 59. Others have won the Masters.   in a major was untouched. Mickelson did not shy away from it. Els bantered to him about it on the way up the fairway. Mickelson talked about it with his caddie, Jim Mackay, as they approached the green. Their read was that the ball should be aimed just outside the right edge of the cup, and Mickelson visualized the putt in his mind before delivering it just where he wanted it to go. It was in. “It was outside a few inches, breaking left in the middle of the putt and then straight the last bit,” he said, a sad smile coming over his face. He paused and shook his head. “Well, it’s supposed to be straight the last bit,” he said."
"O’Reilly: If Blacks Are Committing Crime ‘Out-of-Proportion’ to Other Groups, Why Is There a Racial Component to Blacks in Prison? - Breitbart","Monday on Fox News Channel’s “The O’Reilly Factor,” host Bill O’Reilly used his opening “Talking Points Memo” segment to address Black Lives Matters protesters interrupting former President Bill Clinton at a rally to promote his wife Hillary Clinton’s candidacy for president.  The protesters were focused on Clinton’s 1990s crime legislative, which they argued has unfairly incarcerated black Americans at a higher level. O’Reilly, however, argued that blacks were committing more crime, which make that ethnic groups incarceration rate than any other ethnic group. “Now the race question,” O’Reilly said. “Again, according to FBI data, from 1976 to 1995, black Americans were identified by police as committing more than half of the homicides in the USA.   make up 13 percent of the population. In addition, a national crime victims survey reported that blacks committed robberies at a rate of 60 percent. Again, the black community is just 13 percent of the population. So what’s the beef if black Americans are committing crimes    to other ethnic groups, why is there a racial component to their presence in prison? Why?” O’Reilly also dismissed the incarceration levels were higher because of drug use in the black community, noting that those convicted on   charges were found guilty of trafficking, not use. “Also, forget about the drug myth,” he added. “Right now in federal penitentiaries 99. 5 percent of   inmates are traffickers, not users  —   99. 5 percent. So the question becomes, why is the Democratic Party caving into propaganda put out by radical groups like Black Lives Matter? It is clear that tough sentencing reform spearheaded by both parties in the 90s and signed by Bill Clinton saved perhaps millions of American lives. Yet the entire criminal justice system is now being branded as racist and oppressive. Disgraceful. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"

Teachers Union Leaders Devastated that So Many Members Voted Trump - Breitbart,"Despite the fact that teachers union bosses were all in for Hillary and made a heavy push for members to jump on the Clinton bandwagon, exit polls revealed that a large number of teachers ignored their leaders and voted for Trump. Now union officials are engaging in finger pointing and recriminations. [Union bosses failed to convince large numbers of their own members to follow their lead and vote for Hilary, according to the most recent data. Apparently one in five members of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) voted Trump and one in three  —   an even higher percentage of members of the National Education Association (NEA)  —   went for the real estate mogul despite what union leaders advocated, according to USA Today.  As a result, union leaders are scrambling to try to figure out why so many of their own members broke for the GOP on Election Day. But at least one union chief is calling her own members “sexist” over it all. In recent comments, AFT President Randi Weingarten accused her own membership of sexism for refusing to vote for Hillary. “Frankly I was always concerned about whether the country was ready to have a female president,” Weingarten said. “There was an intensity of hatred that male political figures never get. So I think we’re never really going to understand it. ” Weingarten strongly defended her union’s early support of Clinton despite the number of fans Bernie Sanders garnered among many far left activists. The union boss said she had “no regrets  —   absolutely no regrets” about her support of Clinton. She also noted that Bernie Sanders “was never tested or vetted by anyone, and frankly we have no idea whether he would have actually been able to get through this crucible   …     either. ” Teachers union members are far from the only union folks who supported Trump. While the latest exit polling shows that the bulk of union members still voted Democrat in 2016, the Washington Post reported that Trump trailed Clinton by only eight points among union households. The data shows Trump brought out more union support than any Republican since Ronald Reagan carved out a group of Democrats thereafter known as the “Reagan Democrat. ” Indeed, according to some union activists, Trump’s ascension to the Oval Office may present “an extinction level event” for unions as Republicans take control of both houses of Congress, the White House, and maybe even the Supreme Court if Trump follows through on campaign promises to appoint   justices. Other union leaders are also scratching their heads over why so many of their members broke with leadership and voted Trump. Perhaps in an effort to console himself, The  ’s political director, Michael Podhorzer, told Politico that union members didn’t vote on issues. As far as Podhorzer was concerned, his members only broke for Trump because they didn’t like Mrs. Clinton’s personality. “I would argue that this was not an election that was won or lost on issues and policies,” he insisted. All this navel gazing though, doesn’t explain why unions failed to get stronger support from their own membership despite the tens of millions collectively spent to get Hillary elected. Unions spent a record amount of their members’ dues money on   political activism this year, only to see Democrats lose ground not only in Washington but all across the nation. To name only a few, records show that The National Education Association threw $18. 1 million into the coffers of Democrats and spent another $1. 4 million on advocacy. The Service Employees International Union also opened its pocketbook wide, donating a whopping $19 million to Democrats. And the liberal UNITE HERE spent $4 million just to register voters. All total, unions spent at least $108. 2 million on politics this cycle compared to the $78 million spent in 2012 and the $59. 1 million spent in 2008, according to The Wall Street Journal. Little of that went to Republicans. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com."
Survey: Right Wing People More Likely to Be Sexually Satisfied - Breitbart,"Those who consider themselves as “very right wing” are more likely to have a satisfactory sex life, according to a new European survey by YouGov that interviewed over 19, 000 people. [Just 66% of “left wing” Brits claimed to have a satisfactory sex life. This was significantly less than the 73% of Brits who considered themselves both “very right wing” and sexually satisfied, and the 70% who considered themselves “right wing” and satisfied.  In Germany, 77% of those who considered themselves very right wing also claimed to be satisfied in bed, while 71% of very left wing people claimed to have the same sexual satisfaction. In all five participating countries (Sweden, Germany, France, Denmark, and Britain) very right wing people had the highest level of sexual satisfaction, whilst very left wing people tended to have the lowest on average. “There are obviously numerous factors that might explain an individual’s sexual happiness and this study does not suggest that changing your political views would make you happier in bed (or on the stairs, on the kitchen floor, in the shower and on the backseat of the car),” said YouGov’s head of political and social research, Joe Twyman to Buzzfeed News. The old rules about correlation not equalling causation always apply. Being very right wing doesn’t make you sexually satisfied, but nonetheless, these results suggest it is, in contrast to at least some stereotypes popular in the political world, those on the very right of the political spectrum who enjoy their sex life the most  —   and that this finding is true across a number of different European countries.

"Trump Tells G.O.P. It’s Now or Never, Demanding House Vote on Health Bill - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   President Trump issued an ultimatum on Thursday to recalcitrant Republicans to fall in line behind a broad health insurance overhaul or see their opportunity to repeal the Affordable Care Act vanish, demanding a Friday vote on a bill that appeared to lack a majority to pass. The demand, issued by his budget director, Mick Mulvaney, in an evening meeting with House Republicans, came after a marathon day of negotiating at the White House and in the Capitol in which Mr. Trump  —   who has boasted of his   prowess  —   fell short of selling members of his own party on the health plan. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan emerged from the session and announced curtly that Mr. Trump would get his wish for a vote on Friday. Mr. Ryan refused to answer reporters’ questions about whether he expected the measure to pass. Although the House Republicans’   meeting became a cheerleading session for the bill, their leaders braced for a showdown on the floor, knowing they were likely to be at least a handful of votes short of a majority for the health insurance bill and would need to muscle their colleagues to the last to prevail. Some conservatives were still concerned that the bill was too costly and did not do enough to roll back federal health insurance mandates. Moderates and others, meanwhile, were grappling with worries of their states’ governors and fretted that the loss of benefits would be too much for their constituents to bear. Mr. Ryan had earlier postponed the initial House vote that was scheduled for Thursday to coincide with the seventh anniversary of the Affordable Care Act’s signing. Mr. Trump confronted the possibility of a humiliating loss on the first significant legislative push of his presidency. At a White House meeting with members of the   Freedom Caucus earlier on Thursday, Mr. Trump had agreed to the conservatives’ demands to strip federal health insurance requirements for basic benefits such as maternity care, emergency services, mental health and wellness visits from the bill. But that was not enough to placate the faction, part of the reason that Thursday’s vote was placed on hold. As House leaders struggled to negotiate with holdouts in the hopes of rescheduling the vote, Mr. Trump sent senior officials to the Capitol with a blunt message: He would agree to no additional changes, and Republicans must either support the bill or resign themselves to leaving President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement in place. “We have a great bill, and I think we have a good chance, but it’s only politics,” Mr. Trump said earlier Thursday, as it was becoming clear that his negotiating efforts had failed to persuade enough members of his party to back the plan  —   which was years in the making  —   to repeal and replace the health law. Privately, White House officials conceded that competing Republican factions were each demanding changes that could doom the effort, placing the measure in peril and Mr. Trump’s chances of succeeding at a   legislative deal in jeopardy. With some of its demands in place, the Freedom Caucus ratcheted up its requests, insisting on a repeal of all regulatory mandates in the Affordable Care Act, including the prohibition on excluding coverage for   medical conditions and lifetime coverage caps. Mr. Trump, who has touted his negotiating skills and invited the label “the closer” as the vote approached, was receiving a painful reality check about the difficulty of governing, even with his own party in power on Capitol Hill. “Guys, we’ve got one shot here,” he told members of the Freedom Caucus at a meeting in the Cabinet Room, according to a person present in the room who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the meeting was private. “This is it  —   we’re voting now. ” “The choice is yes or no,” Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas and a member of the Freedom Caucus, said on Thursday night. “I’m not going to vote no to keep Obamacare. That’d be a stupid damn vote. ” Others were unconvinced. Having secured Mr. Trump’s acquiescence to eliminate the requirement that insurers offer “essential health benefits,” members of the Freedom Caucus pressed their advantage. While they did not specify precisely which regulations they wanted to eliminate, the section they wanted to gut requires coverage for   health conditions, allows individuals to remain on their parents’ health care plans up to age 26, bars insurers from setting different rates for men and women, prohibits annual or lifetime limits on benefits, and requires insurers to spend at least 80 percent of premium revenue on medical care. “We’re committed to stay here until we get it done,” said Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Freedom Caucus. “So whether the vote is tonight, tomorrow or five days from here, the president will get a victory. ” He said 30 to 40 Republicans planned to vote “no” House leaders can afford to lose only 22 in order to pass the bill. But for every concession Mr. Trump made to appease critics on the right, he lost potential    supporters in the middle, including members of the centrist Tuesday Group who had balked at the bill’s Medicaid cuts and slashed insurance benefits. Moderate Republicans in that group went to the White House on Thursday but emerged unmoved in their opposition. “There’s a little bit of a balancing act,” conceded Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. Representative Leonard Lance, Republican of New Jersey, said he still opposed the bill because he did not believe it would give people “complete and affordable access” to health insurance. At the same time, a new estimate of the bill’s cost and its impact on health coverage further soured the picture for wavering lawmakers. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on Thursday issued a report on the revised version of the health care bill showing that it would cost more than the original version but would not cover more people. The report said the bill, like the original version, would result in 24 million fewer Americans having health insurance in 2026 than under current law. But recent changes to the bill, made through a series of amendments introduced on Monday, would cut its deficit savings in half. Instead of reducing the deficit by $337 billion, the new version of the bill would save only $150 billion over the decade. The budget office did not consider the effects of various additional changes that remain under negotiation, including eliminating benefit requirements and other health insurance regulations. A Quinnipiac University national poll found that voters disapproved of the Republican plan by lopsided margins, with 56 percent opposed, 17 percent supportive and 26 percent undecided. The measure did not even draw support among a majority of Republicans 41 percent approved, while 24 percent were opposed. President Trump appealed to supporters to weigh in, assuring them in a video on Twitter, “Go with our plan. It’s going to be terrific. ” The chaotic process that unfolded on Thursday exposed Republicans to criticism that they were moving recklessly in a desperate bid to get their plan passed. Representative Raúl Labrador, Republican of Idaho and a Freedom Caucus member, said the party’s leaders had tried to ram through the measure over their members’ objections. He panned what he described as a “brute force” strategy that resembled the approach of former Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio. “It’s better to get it right than to get it fast,” Mr. Labrador said. It was not clear that the changes that Mr. Trump has agreed to and those being demanded could survive. Under the strict budget rules being used to advance the bill, changes to the Affordable Care Act must affect federal spending or revenues. Regulatory measures that affect private health policies, not government programs like Medicaid, are highly likely to be challenged by Senate Democrats. If the Senate parliamentarian rules in the Democrats’ favor, those changes in the House would be stripped from the bill. The emerging power of the Freedom Caucus, a group that has been historically marginalized in policy making but a thorn in the side of leadership, is one of the surprises of the rushed health care debate. The group has been empowered by the addition of Mr. Mulvaney to the senior White House staff, and Mr. Trump’s disengagement from policy details, coupled with his intense desire to score a win after a rocky start to his presidency. Mr. Obama stepped into the fray on Thursday with a lengthy defense of his law on the seventh anniversary of its signing, and a call for bipartisan improvements. “I’ve always said we should build on this law, just as Americans of both parties worked to improve Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid over the years,” he wrote in a mass email to followers. “So if Republicans are serious about lowering costs while expanding coverage to those who need it, and if they’re prepared to work with Democrats and objective evaluators in finding solutions that accomplish those goals  —   that’s something we all should welcome. ” The Affordable Care Act requires insurers to provide “essential health benefits” in 10 broad categories, including maternity care, mental health care, addiction treatment, preventive services, emergency services and rehabilitative services. Mr. Spicer defended the removal of the “essential health benefits” regulations, saying that it would accomplish Mr. Trump’s stated goal of reducing health care costs. “Part of the reason that premiums have spiked out of control is because under Obamacare there were these mandated services that had to be included,” Mr. Spicer said. Family planning groups and advocates for women’s rights criticized Republican plans to roll back these requirements. “Paul Ryan and his House members are willing to sell out the moms of America to pass this bill,” said Dawn Laguens, an executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Conservatives say the mandates, as interpreted in rules issued by the Obama administration, add to the costs of health insurance and make it difficult for insurers to offer   options to meet consumers’ needs. Democrats say that the purpose of insurance is to share risk, and that without federal requirements, insurers would once again offer   policies. Before the Affordable Care Act took effect, maternity coverage was frequently offered as an optional benefit, or rider, for a hefty additional premium."
Obama’s final report card: Did he live up to his promise?," (CNN) Barack Obama ends his two terms in the White House on January 20. Here are 11 takes on his legacy, ranging from health care reform to climate change, immigration to his effect on women and families and beyond. The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors. Julian Zelizer: Obama’s tenuous ’transformational’ legacy, When Barack Obama won his primary contest against Hillary Clinton in 2008, he summed up his quest for the presidency in a speech in St. Paul, Minnesota: ”If we are willing to work for it, and fight for it, and believe in it, then I am absolutely certain that generations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation and restored our image as the last, best hope on Earth. This was the moment   this was the time   when we came together to remake this great nation so that it may always reflect our very best selves, and our highest ideals.” Elected as a transformational figure, the first   president soon had to face the reality of partisanship in Washington and of the limits of presidential power. And as he ends his final term in office, Obama’s legacy hangs in the balance. While Obama wasn’t able to achieve many of the promises  —   such as ending the bitter partisanship of Capitol Hill  —   from the perspective of 2017, he leaves behind a significant record of progress on many of the causes he described in that St. Paul speech. He helped to bring back the nation from a severe economic and financial crisis, while moving forward with a bold domestic agenda that vastly expanded the role of government in health care and financial regulation. For all the talk about   Trump theoretically saving 750 Carrier jobs, Obama’s economic stimulus program, including the auto bailout, actually revived the entire economy and put it back on a pattern of growth. Even when congressional Republicans obstructed everything after 2010, Obama used executive power to make some progress on issues like climate change. Despite many problems overseas  —   the chaos in Syria and the rise of ISIS  —   Obama pushed against the muscular approach to foreign policy embraced by his predecessor George W. Bush, exhibiting a more restrained and cautious approach to intervention overseas, with varying results (something that our writers here will explore). He put into place a historic nuclear arms agreement with Iran, and participated in the Paris Climate Agreement. We don’t know what this will all look like even within a year.   Some of the threat that this legacy faces is a product of Obama’s own failure as a party builder. Unlike Franklin Roosevelt, who left behind a robust New Deal coalition that could protect and expand his programs once he was gone from office, Obama ends his term with Democrats in much worse shape than they were when he started. Republicans now control the governor’s house or the state legislative chamber in 44 states, with full control in 25 states. Nebraska is the exception because its legislature is nonpartisan. If Democrats want to make sure that his legacy does not fall apart, they will have to undertake some very serious   efforts from day one. That will be a priority, if they are to fight back as the GOP tries to dismantle the record that Obama has left behind. Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of ”Jimmy Carter” and ”The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society.” He also is the   of the podcast ”Politics  Polls.”  Sabrina Corlette: He brought health care to 20 million, As a US Senator, Barack Obama would have found it hard to imagine health reform as a signature domestic policy of an Obama presidency to come. Indeed, when the 2008 financial meltdown hit, health care understandably took a back seat to jobs and the economy. But President Obama couldn’t get away from health reform. Mounting evidence that the US health care system was on an unsustainable track forced his administration to make health reform its first major domestic policy initiative.  The facts were unavoidable: insurance was largely inaccessible to millions of people with   health conditions,    Americans were uninsured, medical debt was a chief cause of personal bankruptcy, and a highly inefficient health care system was swallowing an   proportion of the US economy    over 17%  at the time President Obama took office. Reforming health care became not just a priority but an economic imperative. Obama put his presidency on the line to achieve it. When, in the midst of an exhausting and politically divisive legislative debate, senior advisors urged the President to cut a deal and walk away, he refused. Ultimately he signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, now called ”Obamacare,” into law on March 23, 2010. It was, by any measure, an historic accomplishment.  US presidents since Harry Truman had attempted and failed to pass comprehensive health reform, but Obama did it. In spite of a rocky start and unmitigated opposition from Congressional leaders, the law has ended discrimination against people with   conditions, expanded coverage to 20 million mostly working class Americans, slowed the growth of health care costs, and created new incentives for providers to deliver higher quality care at a lower cost. Even with this progress, the law remains controversial. Many provisions are unpopular, particularly the penalty for people who don’t maintain health coverage. Insurers have struggled financially in the law’s new marketplaces, leading some to leave and many of those remaining to raise premiums. The law may be repealed.

Candidate Barack Obama promised in 2008 that he would pass immigration reform in the first six months of his first term. His supporters will tell you he was overwhelmed with the economic crisis and had to spend his chits on passing healthcare reform instead. His opponents will tell you he made a campaign promise to the Latino community and didn’t keep his word. Bottom line, after two terms and eight years, there was no legislative immigration reform.  He did do some things. He deported a heck of a lot of people. One of his allies, Janet Murguia, head of National Council of La Raza, referred to him as the ”  .”  He also signed some significant executive orders. One gave us DACA, which granted temporary status to undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as children. And another gave us DAPA, allowing temporary status for their parents. The latter was found unconstitutional and never implemented.  The former went into effect. About 665, 000 young people are benefiting from DACA. But, and this is a big but, it can be revoked by President Donald Trump as soon as Day 1 of his administration. As a result, these people are living in fear and in limbo.  They do not know if they will be able to continue living and studying and working legally in the country they consider their own. They do not know if the rug will be pulled from under them by a new president. They do not know if they will ever be US citizens, or if they will deported to countries that many of them barely know.  So what’s Obama’s legacy on immigration? The DACA kids don’t know, their friends and loved ones don’t know. None of us know.  Final grade on immigration: C, Since in my view, immigration is not much of an Obama legacy, which makes me sad, let’s talk about his biggest legacy    the indisputable thing we can all agree on: He was the first black president of the United States.  Folks, regardless of your political affiliation or gender or race or creed or age, the fact that Barack Obama was the first   elected to lead our nation is historically significant to our country. It is also personally significant to many of us. Did Obama’s election usher in a   era in America? No. It did not. There are still huge education and employment gaps between   and whites in the United States. Did it mean racism has ended? No, it did not. We’ve all seen shocking, racially motivated hate crimes    whites against blacks, blacks against whites, and between every other color and ethnicity    caught on camera in the last eight years.  But yes, President Obama’s election was hugely symbolic. It meant so much to   boys and girls    like 5   Jacob Philadelphia, who wanted to know if President Obama’s hair was like his    to see someone that looked like them in the White House. They now know that one day they can grow up to be president.  It meant so much to    Virginia McLaurin, born in the segregated South. She thought she would never live to see a black president. But she got to dance with a black president in the White House.  It meant so much to the young men participating in President Obama’s initiative, My Brother’s Keeper, which offers opportunities to boys and young men of color who want to get ahead. It meant so much to   mothers and fathers to hear a president talk about the realities, the fears, the challenges of growing up black in America. And it meant so much to many of us   Americans who acknowledge that there’s is much work left to be done but hope President Obama’s election was one more little step towards us being a more united nation and a better community.

The Obama legacy is poor growth    poor macroeconomic growth, poor productivity growth, and especially poor wage growth.   average hourly earnings have grown at a minuscule annual rate of 0. 25% since the recovery began in June 2009.  The failure to deliver a rising return to work has stressed American families and fed the populist political uprising. It is his most significant economic failure. That is certainly not how Obama wants to be remembered. His advocates repeatedly stress the deep recession he inherited, the recovery actions, and the average of nearly 160, 000 jobs created each month that drove the unemployment rate below 5%.  But the attempt to tie the recovery to Barack Obama misses two key points.  First, any president would have acted. It is inconceivable that in circumstances that dire a new president would have sat idly by. Second, the economy was going to recover at some point all any president’s policies can do is speed things up. Thus, the issue is the quality of the recovery policies not a case the Obama advocates can successfully make. The legacy is not the 5% of the labor force that finally found jobs. The legacy is the 90% of the labor force that had a job, still has a job, and continues to wait for a raise.   Final grade:   Douglas   is the president of the American Action Forum.

Brown: The exceptionalism of Obama’s presidency, Symbols are important. Let’s talk about the exceptionalism of President Barack Obama. The Latin term sui generis comes to mind. He is not like anything else. First, his name: Barack Hussein Obama. If a writer gave that name to a character in a political novel, readers might bristle at its implausibility.   But beyond his name, so much of Obama’s life veers away from the experiences of most black Americans.  He is the son of an African man, from Kenya, and was raised by a white Kansan mother and white grandparents in Hawaii    one of the most   places in America. (According to the 2010 Census, its population is 1. 6% black.) He attended an elite college preparatory high school, Punahou, in Honolulu, very selective colleges and then an even more selective law school. He was the first black    of the Harvard Law Review. He married a black woman who attended Princeton University and Harvard Law School. In 1993 he became a homeowner. Though he and his wife had $120, 000 of student debt, he was able to pay off their student loans with proceeds from a book advance. He became a millionaire as a result of his   books. His taxable income in 2005 was roughly $1. 5 million.  I could go on, but this is enough to contrast President and Mrs. Obama with their black peers.  Most blacks do not attend college preparatory schools. Only 7% of students enrolled in selective colleges are black and of those with advanced degrees just 8. 2% are black. A recent Brookings study showed that black college graduates owe more in student loans than whites and that gap increases over time.  The unemployment rate for black college graduates is twice the rate of white college graduates. The majority of blacks are renters and not homeowners. White women are more than twice as likely to marry someone with equal or greater education as black women. Median household income for college educated blacks is $82, 300 compared with $106, 600 for whites.  Most blacks do not have President Obama’s story, which is why the symbolism of his achievement is so significant.  Symbols are important. In 2008, America elected our first black President. No matter what Republicans try to do, they will never be able to take that away from him    or us. His biography will always include the words 44th President of the United States of America. Immediately after the election, however, we started hearing commentators discussing our entry into a   era. Because a black man had been elected president, they argued that racism was a thing of the past. Except John McCain got 55% of the white vote in 2008 and Mitt Romney got 59% in 2012. The majority of white voters each time voted for the white guy. How can racism be over when most white voters rejected the black guy? We were not then nor have we ever been  .  Nevertheless, the majority of whites think racial discrimination is not the reason blacks do not get ahead. As a result, they see the election of a black president as support for their views. I suspect some whites who hold this view never voted for him and fail to see any irony in that.  Symbolism, it turned out, was a bad thing for addressing   racism in America. The symbolism of a black President prevented America from grappling with the reality of how exceptional his victory and his story really was.  Final grade: A+ on symbolism C for real change, Dorothy A. Brown is a professor of law at Emory University. Jennifer Morgan:  A   leader on climate change, President Barack Obama moved climate change from a supposed fringe ”environmental” issue into the heart of economic, energy and foreign policy, right where it belongs.  As he understood the risks and opportunities more, he integrated it more, working with people across the country and globally to put in place national and international rules, regulations and agreements to tackle the problem.   Whether it was his time in Alaska speaking with communities that were losing their homes from climate change or his visits to solar plants in the Midwest, where new jobs were created, Obama worked to make the issue real for people    something that has been lacking in the debate.  He took foreign leaders by surprise by placing climate change at the top of his diplomatic agenda, working to create an effective international pact to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet.  The Paris Agreement was only possible because of the multiple decisions Obama made to modernize the US economy away from coal to renewable energy, and to keep fossil fuels in the ground  —   most recently by banning drilling in places like the Atlantic and the Arctic.  He brought a new positive dynamic to the international climate debate.  That momentum is deep and will not be easily turned back, a lasting legacy from Obama’s time in office. But beyond the impact of his actions and the international treaties, President Obama showed his understanding of what it means to connect the head and the heart. He often talked about what the world would be like for his daughters, and other young people, if his generation did not act to change this course of history.   There is still so much more to do in so little time to change course, but moving climate change from fringe to center stage has transformed the way the issue is understood by people, including corporate and local and national leaders.  From there, there is no turning back.   Final grade: B+ Jennifer Morgan is the Executive Director of Greenpeace International. Follow her on Twitter. Ted Olson: New dignity for gays and lesbians, Amid all the talk about President Obama’s legacy, something remarkable has been largely overlooked.  On November 8, 2008, just as voters throughout the United States were electing the nation’s first   president, voters in liberal California were approving Proposition 8. Like scores of similar measures adopted in other states, it banned marriage except between a man and a woman.  As a result, gays and lesbians were walled off from what the Supreme Court has repeatedly described as the most important relationship in life. The public overwhelmingly approved measures like Prop 8, denying loving   couples the right to be married. At the time, Obama said that he, too, disapproved of   marriage.  Indeed, the issue was so toxic that George W. Bush had leveraged it to assist his 2004 reelection.   But then President Obama changed his mind.   He ”evolved,” as he put it.  He announced his opposition to discrimination in all forms:  in the armed forces, in the federal ”Defense of Marriage Act” that had passed overwhelming during the Clinton administration and was signed by President Clinton, and in Proposition 8 and similar measures.  His Justice Department went into court calling such measures unconstitutional.  In short order, the mood of the country changed, and the courts repeatedly held that laws such as Proposition 8 violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the US Constitution.  The widely anticipated public backlash against such rulings never materialized.  Now persons in every state may marry the person they love, regardless of gender.  President Obama’s intervention was a watershed.  He helped return equality and equal dignity to gays and lesbians throughout the nation.  This is a permanent and transformative part of his legacy.

He has argued 62 cases in the United States Supreme Court, including Hollingsworth v. Perry, the case upholding the overturning of California’s Proposition 8, banning   marriages.                  Stephanie Coontz:  A commitment to equality and families, The legacy President Obama leaves for American families was shaped by legislation and by powerful example. For eight years the first family has been a living refutation of the negative stereotypes about black families that so often dominate cultural debates.  Obama’s efforts on behalf of equal pay for women will also have a lasting impact on families. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act ended the practice of not compensating women for pay discrimination unless they filed suit within 180 days of when the discrimination began. Even with a   Congress, Donald Trump would have a hard time reversing this.  Republicans seem determined to defund Planned Parenthood, restrict access to contraception and overturn legal abortion. And it’s doubtful that Trump and his misogynistic chief strategist will continue Obama’s efforts to combat sexual assault on campus and in the military. If the new administration underestimates the strong public support for reproductive choice and for victims of sexual violence, part of Obama’s legacy might be a new groundswell of activism on these issues.  Republicans have vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which gave 20 million Americans new access to health insurance. But one legacy of Obamacare, even among its opponents, is a heightened sense that affordable health insurance is a right. If insurers go back to denying coverage to those with   conditions or to young adults who rely on their parents’ policies, a strong backlash is likely. Obama inherited a severe recession, precipitated by a decade of financial deregulation, tax cuts for the rich, outsourcing of jobs,   and   in infrastructure. At the depth of the recession in 2010, the unemployment rate hit 10%. By Obama’s final month in office, the jobless rate had been halved and more than 14 million new jobs had been produced.  But Obama’s recovery program was extremely deferential to Republican financial priorities. This may have created the biggest threat to his legacy. Unlike Franklin D. Roosevelt, who responded to his era’s foreclosure crisis by having the government buy failing mortgages and restructure them so households could make their payments, Obama chose to bail out banks rather than their victims.  His stimulus package incorporated Republican demands for tax cuts while rejecting calls by liberal Democrats for criminal sanctions against misbehaving banks and for greater investment in jobs programs.  In the absence of initiatives to bolster workers’ bargaining power, the recovery failed to halt the declines in social mobility over the past 40 years. In 1980, some 80% of people aged 30 earned more than their parents had earned at the same age. Today half of Americans in their   make less than their parents did at the same age, even while the highest earners make (or inherit) much, much more.  Chronic economic uncertainty makes it hard for people to sustain or even enter stable relationships. And growing economic inequality has greatly increased the educational advantage of   children.  By failing to address the persistence of the economic insecurity that had built up well before his watch and the frustration of many   workers about lost jobs and stagnant wages, Obama may have inadvertently hurt his party in the industrial states that helped secure Trump’s electoral victory. Obama might have better protected his legacy    or ensured the election of a successor who would do so    if he had  pushed earlier to change a system that really was, as Trump insisted during the campaign, rigged against working families. We’ll never know. But we do know that Trump’s incoming Cabinet of plutocrats is unlikely to leave a legacy that benefits most American families.

If Hillary Clinton had won, the nation could have looked forward to a new liberal era on the Supreme Court    with secure protections for abortion rights, gay rights, and the rights of racial minorities.  But with Trump now to fill the vacancy left by the death of Antonin Scalia, and perhaps the departure of other aging justices, conservatives again can look with confidence to the courts to vindicate their agenda. Obama appointed more than 300 federal judges, roughly the same number as his predecessors Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. All federal judges serve for life, and so their influence extends long after presidents leave office.  Obama’s choices were notable for their diversity. He appointed record numbers of women and minorities to the bench, as well as several openly gay jurists. He appointed Sonia Sotomayor (the first Hispanic) and Elena Kagan (the fourth woman) to the Supreme Court, and they have been strong liberal voices there.  But if their liberal colleagues Ruth Bader Ginsburg (age 83) and Stephen Breyer (78) as well as the moderate Anthony Kennedy (80) leave during Trump’s presidency, the Court will take a conservative turn for at least a generation. That, depending on one’s perspective, is a cause for terror or celebration.  Final grade: B+ Jeffrey Toobin is CNN’s senior legal analyst and author of ”The Oath: The Obama White House and the Supreme Court.” Frida Ghitis:  On foreign policy, good intentions, but a disappointment, Barack Obama took office at a time of global crises and international disdain for what many perceived as an overly aggressive US foreign policy under George W. Bush. He set out to reverse many of his predecessor’s policies, but in his eagerness at restraint he pulled back too far. Under Obama, the US came to be seen as a country that speaks strongly and doesn’t want to use a stick. To be sure, Obama’s oratorical gifts, when he used them in defense of American principles of equality, justice and freedom, are among the elements of US foreign policy we will sorely miss during the next administration. His Nobel Peace Prize lecture, including his explanation of why sometimes fighting is necessary, was one of his finest moments, even if the award itself remains puzzling.  Above all, Obama was reluctant to use force, as all presidents should be, and he leaned heavily on diplomacy    the correct order of priorities but one that might have ended up weakening his negotiating effectiveness. In a world where the ability to use force can translate into diplomatic muscle, America proved a weak negotiator and a poor strategic player. It happened with Iran, with whom the idea of making a deal was never wrong. But Iran outplayed the US and the allies who relied on Washington to lead them. And it happened in talks over Syria after Obama backed down from the threat of force after drawing a ”red line.”  Similarly, negotiations with Cuba were the right idea, poorly executed. The US gave the Castro regime an enormous gift, a lifeline, and secured almost no concessions    such as demanding more personal freedoms for Cubans    in return.  On Israelis and Palestinians, once again, Obama misplayed what could have been a strong hand. By placing new demands on Israelis and essentially none on Palestinians, he made Israelis feel they couldn’t trust him. He unwittingly helped strengthen the Israeli right and Palestinian intransigence, further distancing the two sides. America’s Arab friends in the Middle East were also thrown off by Obama’s diplomacy, wondering if Washington was confusing friends and foes. Obama might have salvaged his foreign policy legacy were it not for Syria, which history will judge his and the world’s greatest failure. If the US had given strong support to   forces early in the conflict, the history of the last few years would have been completely different.  Assad might have negotiated his resignation millions of refugees might not have flooded out and destabilized the Middle East and even Europe ISIS might not have created havoc, and hundreds of thousands of Syrians who died in the war might be alive today.  His foreign policy legacy is one good intentions and disappointing results.

Reyes:  The faded promise of immigration reform  We are no closer to solving our undocumented immigration problem now than we were eight years ago.  If anything, the country seems more polarized around this issue than ever before.  Yet it is unfair to blame President Obama for the failure of comprehensive reform.  Immigration policy is the job of Congress.   The President clearly recognized the contributions of immigrants and pushed Congress to enact reform that included a path to citizenship for the undocumented.  We could have had immigration reform in 2013, after the bipartisan ”Gang of Eight” passed its landmark immigration bill.  Its failure rests with House Republicans, who refused to even allow a vote on the measure.   To his credit, in 2012 Obama provided deportation relief to more than 740, 000 young people through his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.  He attempted to grant similar relief to a larger class of undocumented immigrants through executive action in 2014, which failed due to legal challenges brought by Republican governors.   Had he succeeded in expanding DACA and implementing the proposed Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) Obama could have provided deportation relief and work permits to nearly half of our undocumented population. However, these were stopgap measures, and temporary. Meanwhile, Obama’s record deportations were unceasing and permanent.  Multiply his 2. 5 million removals    more than any other president    by a factor of all the families separated, communities disrupted, and due process denied to get a true sense of the devastation that his aggressive immigration enforcement policies have had on the Latino and immigrant populations.   The Obama administration also took a confounding,   approach towards Central American asylum seekers and refugees, treating them as illegal entrants when many were fleeing for their lives.   Conservative critics like to claim that he could have made immigration reform happen at the beginning of his first term, when Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress.  This overlooks that, at the time, the President was fully occupied with righting our economy, which was on the brink of collapse, and moving his signature healthcare bill forward.  It would have been unrealistic for the president, at such a critical juncture, to prioritize the needs of our undocumented population over American citizens.    The sad irony is that he seems to have paid a price for acting in good faith.  He apparently believed that if he ramped up immigration enforcement, then Republicans would trust him and come onboard for comprehensive reform.  So Obama did his part, zealously enforcing immigration law    to the point where he was tagged the ”  ”    and yet Republicans refused to work with him anyway.  The President now owns a complicated immigration legacy, one that has no doubt left him as frustrated as many of his Latino and immigrant allies.   Final grade: B, Raul A.

Boris Nemtsov: Opposition figure who took on Putin," (CNN) The slaying of prominent Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov in the heart of Moscow has shocked Russia and the wider world. His murder, two days before a planned opposition march, has also outraged fellow opposition figures and prompted a slew of speculation over who could be behind it. Some government critics pointed fingers in the direction of President Vladimir Putin or one of his supporters. State media reported Nemtsov had received threats linked to his stance on the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris.  The Kremlin suggested Nemtsov may have been killed by enemies of Russia intent on creating political discord. The leader of Russia’s Communist Party similarly blamed   ”provocation,” according to the official news agency Tass. So who was Boris Nemtsov? And how did he make so many enemies? A Kremlin critic, Nemtsov, 55, was a top official with the Republican Party of   of People’s Freedom, a liberal opposition group.  He had been arrested several times for speaking against Putin’s government. The most recent arrests were in 2011 when he protested the results of parliamentary elections and in 2012 when tens of thousands protested against Putin. He had most recently been critical of the Kremlin’s handling of the Ukraine crisis. Opposition leader Ilya Yashin said his friend had been working on a report about Russian troops and their involvement in Ukraine. In a blog entry, published on the website of radio station Echo of Moscow, Nemtsov wrote last weekend that the Kremlin now accused him of being behind the protests in Kiev’s Maidan, or Independence Square, which led to the ouster of Ukraine’s   President Viktor Yanokovych. He posted a picture from an ” ” protest held in Moscow which showed a marcher holding a sign with his face under the words ”Maidan organizer.” ”The Kremlin has changed its concept,” Nemtsov wrote. ”It used to say it’s the State Department who organized the Maidan, and now they say it’s me.” In a   interview conducted only hours before his death with Newsweek magazine, Nemtsov said Russia was ”drowning” under Putin’s leadership and was swiftly becoming a fascist state. ”Due to the policy of Vladimir Putin, a country with unparalleled potential is sinking, an economy which accumulated untold currency reserves is collapsing,” he said. ”This government wades into a costly, fratricidal war in Ukraine and into pointless confrontation with the West. We all feel the effects of this insane policy.” Nemtsov accused Putin of using ”  propaganda”    a reference to Nazi Germany’s propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels    to brainwash his fellow countrymen. One element of this was to implant them ”with a virus of inferiority complex towards the West, the belief that the only thing we can do to amaze the world is use force, violence and aggression,” Nemtsov said. Putin has condemned Nemtsov’s murder and ordered a swift investigation. The Kremlin has denied direct involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine.  An   campaigner, Nemtsov was also known for    and may have made enemies from    his   stance. Early in his career, Nemtsov won praise for his efforts as governor of Nizhniy Novgorod, a large city and major economic hub. Nemtsov was also a vocal critic of the 2014 Winter Olympics held in Sochi, calling them one of the most ”outrageous swindles” in recent Russian history. In a 2013 report, he questioned where $20 billion to $30 billion had gone, saying preparations for the Games had been characterized by ”embezzlement” and ”unprecedented corruption.” In a restaurant interview with CNN’s Anthony Bourdain last year, Nemtsov lamented the situation for business owners. ”This is a country of corruption. And if you have business, you are in a very unsafe situation. Everybody can press you and destroy your business. That’s it,” Nemtsov said. In the same interview, he did offer a hint of optimism. ”This is my country. The Russian people are in bit of trouble. Russian court doesn’t work. Russian education decline every year. I believe that Russia has a chance to be free. Has a chance. It’s difficult, but we must do it,” he said. In a statement after his death, U. S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Nemtsov had always worked toward a more democratic and prosperous Russia. ”In every post, he sought to reform and open Russia, and to empower the Russian people to have a greater say in the life of their country,” he said. A former deputy Prime Minister, Years before he became a key opposition leader, Nemtsov served as deputy Prime Minister under former President Boris Yeltsin, the first   President. Back in the 1990s, he was a   bound for greater things. But he lost out in the struggle to succeed Yeltsin and had been marginalized since Putin was elected, said Peter Baker, author of ”Kremlin Rising” and a New York Times reporter. ”He was a person who had been fierce in his criticism of Putin. He’d clearly gotten under Putin’s skin on a number of occasions. A number of people had become his enemies,” Baker said. Baker said Nemtsov tried to work with Putin’s regime at first but soon switched to the opposition. ”History will remember him as someone who took chances, who risked his life literally to speak out in a country where speaking out is not encouraged, to say the least,” Baker said. Opinion: Nemtsov killing: A chilling historical parallel? An honest patriot, Nemtsov was a man who impressed many who met him with his energy and passion for his homeland. Sir Andrew Wood, a former UK ambassador to Russia, told CNN that Nemtsov, whom he knew personally in the 1990s, was a ”genuine Russian patriot” who opposed what the Kremlin had come to stand for. ”He was enthusiastic, he was engaging, I think he was always true to his beliefs, he didn’t take himself   but he did his best to promote liberal reform then, and he had been before a very successful mayor of one of the central towns, Nizhniy Novgorod.” Former U. S. Ambassador Michael McFaul paid tribute to Nemtsov ”as a real patriot, who believed in the possibility of Russia’s greatness” and said he wept for both Nemtsov’s family and the country he loved. ”Politics aside, he was always a loyal, loving friend of mine for 20 years. We all will miss him dearly,” he said. Putin, in a telegram to Nemtsov’s mother Dina Eydman, also paid tribute to Nemtsov’s integrity. ”Boris Nemtsov, left his mark on the history of Russia, in politics and public life. He worked on important positions in the difficult transition period for our country. He always openly and honestly stated his position, defended his point of view,” he said.  Putin vowed that her son’s killers would be ”properly punished.” A marked man? Nemtsov’s death has shocked Russia, but it may not have come as a total surprise. Nemtsov acknowledged in an interview with Russian newspaper Sobesednik this month that he was ”a little bit” afraid that his mother’s fear    that Putin would have him killed    would come true. But, he added, ”I’m not afraid of him that much. If I was afraid I wouldn’t be heading an opposition party and do what I’m doing.” Nemtsov’s lawyer Vadim Prokhorov told Russian media that Nemtsov’s life had been threatened on social media in recent weeks. But he didn’t walk around with bodyguards, noted Julia Ioffe, a contributing writer to The New York Times Magazine who has covered Russian politics extensively. ”It was a very overt message of bravery,” Ioffe told CNN’s ”AC360.”  ”What we’ve seen in return is a very overt message of fear. People in the opposition will not believe anything that comes out of the Kremlin in terms of who did this. They perceive this as a message directly sent to them. When you see Boris Nemtsov’s body lying with the Kremlin as a backdrop, they understand that’s a message directed to them.” In his final Newsweek interview, Nemtsov spoke of the need for ”an alternative vision, a different idea of Russia. Our idea is the one of a democratic and open Russia. A country which is not applying bandit methods to its own citizens and neighbors.” Crowds mourn Boris Nemtsov"
The Original Sharing Economy,"At the Sharing Depot, a storefront in Toronto, $50 a year buys tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of tools, camping supplies, furniture, games, toys, sports equipment, and much else. At least on a   basis: The owners of the space call it a “library of things,” and anyone who pays the annual membership fee can borrow anything in the Sharing Depot, whose aisles look a lot like those at a regular   store. The difference is that everything on the shelves can be checked out like a library book. Ryan Dyment, a   of the Sharing Depot, explained that his business takes advantage of the fact that people own things they hardly ever use. “We’ve produced way more than what we need to live well,” Dyment says. “There are basements and garages full of stuff. ” The Sharing Depot opened in 2013 and currently has more than 2, 200 members. Roughly a dozen stores around the world call themselves libraries of things, but unofficial sharing libraries are much more plentiful. According to Dyment, there are about 80 tool libraries established in North America, Europe, and Oceania, and there are probably many more that operate on smaller scales. Also, lots of equipment owned by universities is available for public use, and farmers sometimes develop   programs to spread out the cost of using large machinery. Aside from promoting a spirit of community, the Sharing Depot’s model is also financially beneficial for the people who use it. Borrowing instead of buying can save money, and it makes it easier for people to obtain things that would usually be beyond their means. “It levels the playing field, when everyone has access to the same things,” Dyment explains. He says his kids can now, for instance, “get new toys every week if they want to. ” Likewise, when Dyment sold his car and started using a   service, he says it saved him $10, 000 a year. People who share don’t “have to play this game of ‘How do I get enough digits in my imaginary bank account to access these things? ’” he says. And sharing is of course easier on the environment. “Our economic model doesn’t work with the environmental needs we have,” Dyment says. “I think we need to move to a situation where people are working less and consuming less, but they’re sharing more. ” He laments that so many   products are now made not with durability in mind, but with an eye on planned obsolescence. Stronger,   products would be, among other things, better for sharing. Today, it’s taken for granted that nearly all objects belong to someone. But while the spirit of the Sharing Depot is a break with the present, it has historically been the norm:   —  which is what humans were for most of the time they’ve been humans —  are thought to have shared nearly everything. According to Sam Bowles, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts,   likely didn’t have a conception of private property. “Among mobile   during the late Pleistocene, food was almost certainly widely shared as it was acquired,” Bowles wrote in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “If you didn’t share,” he says, “you’d be violating a basic social norm. ” And according to the anthropologist David Graeber’s 2013 book Debt: The First 5, 000 Years, the Iroquois used to stockpile goods in longhouses, and women’s councils would decide who could use what. This jives with the communal storage spaces that archaeologists have found at the sites of villages of some   who were among the first to turn sedentary. This idea of sharing everything matches observations of   tribes that still exist today. “They’re very free with one another’s things,” explains Daniel Everett, an anthropologist at Bentley University who spent years studying the Pirahã, a group of   in the Amazon. Everett remembers lending things to the Pirahã, only to find that the borrowers were “continually mystified” when he came back to pick up an item. “They are always incredulous when I’d come over to get it,” he says. “I wasn’t using it, and they needed it, so what’s the big deal?” He explains that, while one person in the group might primarily own an object, the property is all but private. “They frequently take each others’ things, and there’s no fuss about it,” he adds. Bowles, based on his and others’ research, thinks that private ownership may have originated around 11, 000 years ago, as humans started farming. Agriculture and private property likely evolved together, since farmers are generally loath to let others reap what they have sown. As some   settled down in fishing villages and other areas where there was plenty of food to be found or grown, they started building private living spaces. Archeological evidence suggests that they slowly stopped storing food communally and started keeping it in their houses instead. “What farming allowed people to do is take a very small plot of land or particular group of animals   …     and say, ‘This is mine,’” Bowles explains. But farming was “not a bargain in terms of standard of living,” Bowles says. An hour of farming actually yielded fewer calories than an hour of hunting and gathering, and early farmers were shorter, had worse teeth, and were likely less healthy than  . But the populations of farmers grew more quickly than those of the     largely because being rooted makes it easier to have a lot of kids: It’s hard to take care of lots of young children when constantly on the move. A group of   might consist of only 30 adults, while a farming village might have thousands. This population disparity made it easier for farmers to take over  ’ territory and use it for farmland. “They eventually took over the world,” says Bowles, and they brought their system of property rights with them. Indeed, that’s essentially what happened only a few centuries ago as Europeans arrived in Australia, Africa, and the Americas, where some peoples were   some were farmers, and some were something in between. But until the 1700s, nearly every human settlement —  even long after conceptions of private property had taken shape —  had a “commons,” shared land that locals could use for farming crops and grazing animals. In medieval England, local juries decided who was allowed to use certain tracts in what was a pretty democratic system, explains Ellen Rosenman, a University of Kentucky professor who specializes in English history. The governing of the commons wasn’t completely egalitarian —  wealthy farmers had extra influence, for instance. But people who truly needed something got it: Villages set extra land aside for the poor, and the extremely rich were often not allowed to use common land. “Sometimes people who had no money were allowed to use the land for free,” Rosenman says. Unlike modern farmland, which is usually divided into   parcels, English commons were doled out in strips. As a result, farmers would work alongside each other, making it easier to share tools and help each other out. “In general, it was a more communal way of life,” Rosenman explains. “It was designed so that everyone in the community could survive. ” This all started to change during the Industrial Revolution, when better technology made farming much more profitable. Businesspeople, seeing a new opportunity, were eager to grow food, and governments were apparently happy to give them the land to do it: A slew of what were called “Inclosure Acts” were passed in the U. K. between 1750 to 1850, explains Rosenman, as communal land was given over to individuals, most of them wealthy. “Big land owners kind of gobbled [the commons] up,” Rosenman says. “By the time it was all done, there was virtually no common land anymore. ” According to Rosenman, the farmland itself suffered as a result. Laborers hired by big landowners weren’t all that invested in the land they were working on, so they didn’t always take care of it very well —  a historical echo of Dyment’s   complaint that many consumer goods aren’t designed or bought with   usage in mind. Historians disagree about how these acts affected people’s lives. Some, for instance, note that many at the time were excited that farming had become more efficient. But Rosenman points out that that the vast majority of   writers considered these land claims a disaster. Commoners lost their farms, and with them, “they lost their claim to being part of the nation,” Rosenman says. “The psychic consequences” —  a reduced sense of independence and identity —  “were massive. ” The English commons are a pretty good example of how land went from public to private in other places throughout history: New technologies made industrial agriculture viable, wealthy landowners overtook small farms, and displaced farmers found work elsewhere, a lot of the time in factories. This script did not always play out without resistance, though. A variety of communities —  from native groups to   laborers to religious orders —  have fought against the idea of private property. In the 1500s, for instance, some adherents of Anabaptism, a branch of Christianity, argued that private property contradicted Jesus’s view that God created the world for everyone. Acting on their views, they took over a town in Germany and outlawed private property. “God had made all things common, as today we can still enjoy air, fire, rain, and the sun in common, and whatever else some thieving, tyrannical man cannot grasp for himself,” preached one of the Anabaptists’ leaders.   communities that discourage private ownership are less rebellions than they are isolated pockets of   cultures.   American utopian communities proposed a more communal way of life, just like the   Israeli kibbutzim, which often share everything from food to tools to laundry machines. In a similar vein, Amish communities have “barn raisings” in which whole communities get together to build a barn for an individual. But today, the sharing that most people engage in is more often digital: Music, games, videos, computer code, programs, ideas, research, and articles are all frequently shared for free online, to the point that the internet is the closest thing there is to a   commons. And in what has come to be called “the sharing economy,” the internet enables people to sell access to everything from extra bedrooms to car rides to video equipment. Companies such as Uber and Airbnb allow people to quickly and efficiently secure temporary use of things that belong to someone else. But   companies exist in the same economy that McDonald’s and Starbucks do. Uber, Airbnb, and the like ultimately depend on profit, not generosity. Ownership is still private everything is rented, not truly shared. The sharing economy might be a significant step toward more efficiently tapping into the wealth of physical things owned by individuals —  as opposed to corporations —  but it’s still vastly different from the kind of sharing that defined humanity for tens of thousands of years."

Breitbart’s Marlow: O’Reilly Ouster ‘Pyrrhic Victory’ for Totalitarian Left,"Breitbart    Alex Marlow tells Los Angeles Times’ David Ng that Bill O’Reilly’s ouster from Fox News was a “Pyrrhic victory” for the partisan activists who organized the advertiser boycott against him. [From the Los Angeles Times:  Some see the O’Reilly drama as a partisan attack from activists who care little about the victims of sexual harassment. “The motives are deeply political,” said Alex Marlow,    at Breitbart News, the conservative,   website. He said the advertiser boycott of “The O’Reilly Factor”  —   which saw numerous advertisers jump ship after the sexual allegations were made public  —   represents the creeping influence of corporate executives over what goes on in newsrooms around the country. “It’s creating an America where corporations decide what can and can’t be said, and I don’t like the idea where the corporations have so much control,” Marlow said. “Corporations are under pressure to pull advertising from anyone who is right of center  —   it’s an attack on free speech. ”   …     “Fox’s   lineup is actually becoming more ” said Marlow. “So the left is getting a Pyrrhic victory. ” Read the rest here.

"Obama Administration Shut Down Whistleblower Program Revealing 1,811 Aliens From Terrorist Countries Granted Citizenship - Breitbart","Under the Obama administration, 1, 811 aliens from terrorist countries were granted U. S. citizenship instead of being deported —  and the Obama administration ended the program that uncovered the extensive fraud. [Originally, the Associated Press reported that the aliens’ fingerprints were not in searchable government databases, allowing them to apply for citizenship under different names and birthdays.  The scope of the problem is massive: “Fingerprints are missing from federal databases for as many as 315, 000 immigrants with final deportation orders or who are fugitive criminals,” the Associated Press stated. “Immigration and Customs Enforcement has not reviewed about 148, 000 of those immigrants’ files to add fingerprints to the digital record. ” Three of the aliens under final deportation orders who were granted citizenship gained access to secure commercial airliner areas and maritime facilities. Another is working as a law enforcement officer. But the Obama administration shut down that program, the Office of Inspector General found: In 2016, OPS [Office of Operations Coordination] eliminated Operation Janus and disbanded its staff, which raises concerns about the future ability of ICE [U. S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement] and USCIS to continue identifying and prioritizing individuals for investigation. Since 2010 and until recently, Operation Janus identified these individuals, created watchlist entries to ensure law enforcement and immigration officials were aware of them, and coordinated DHS and other agencies’ activities related to these individuals. Two DHS employees outside of OPS said that without Operation Janus, it would be difficult to coordinate these cases and combat immigration fraud perpetrated by individuals using multiple identities. We received this information late in our review and cannot assess the future impact of this change. ICE didn’t consistently log the digital fingerprints of illegal aliens their agents found until 2010 —  and federal prosecutors have repeatedly declined criminal cases that could end in the aliens being stripped of their citizenship. The implications were not lost on one DHS whistleblower. “If the Department of Homeland Security was serious about this, they would not have shut down the program that discovered this lapse in the first place,” whistleblower Philip Haney said on Fox and Friends Tuesday. “They say they’re addressing it, but they shut the program down that originally discovered it. It’s hard to effectively address it. But they say they have recommendations that the agencies are following, and they’re expecting a   report. ” Haney believed that “  fraud” took place: “These individuals are from countries of concern, for terrorists. All of them. The report makes that quite plain. If you come to a law enforcement officer, and you don’t have your complete records, your fingerprints in particular, that could halt the process right there. How people came into the country, either legally or illegally, and accidentally gained citizenship is an impossible concept to me, as a law enforcement officer. ”"
Business Insider: TPP Could Destroy Clinton’s Chances for White House - Breitbart,"Rachel Rothschild writes in Business Insider that the   Partnership (TPP) could become a big problem for Hillary Clinton’s campaign. [Hillary Clinton and many of her fellow Democrats meeting in Philadelphia hope to show the party unity arguably lacking when the Republicans gathered in Cleveland.  A sticking point to a unified Democratic Party, however, has been the   Partnership (TPP) one of the most contentious topics of debate between supporters of Clinton and erstwhile rival Bernie Sanders. Despite significant lobbying, Sanders failed to secure opposition to the TPP in a draft of the Democratic Party platform. As a result, the TPP could become a key issue in the election this fall. Donald Trump’s antipathy to the deal is   and he managed to convince “the party of free trade” to drop any mention of the TPP in its party platform, whether in support or opposition. And exit polls from the primaries showed that antitrade sentiment was a key driver of support for Sanders over Clinton. But, as my research on the history of environmental science and diplomacy highlights, there’s one significant drawback of the TPP that neither side has talked about: how it departs from a   of diplomatic progress on the environment and human rights. The TPP, a trade accord among a dozen   countries, has received significant criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. The main concern has been the potential impact on American workers and the U. S. economy. However, the TPP has other glaring deficiencies that also deserve attention by Congress and the presidential candidates: the poor protection given to the environment, food safety and human rights. There is not a single mention of climate change or human rights in the treaty text. Conservation protections for wildlife are minimal at best. Foreign companies are granted the ability, for example, to challenge environmental laws of other countries through a controversial clause known as the   dispute settlement system. And the TPP’s environment chapter is weaker than those in previous free trade agreements. Because of these flaws, more than 1, 500 organizations, including major U. S. environmental and humanitarian groups, have come out against the TPP. While leaked documents from the TPP negotiations suggest the U. S. acquiesced to other countries attempts to weaken the agreement, history shows that tying environmental and human rights issues into larger strategic agreements actually strengthens these treaties.

Police: Gay YouTuber Faked Hate Crime Attack on Himself - Breitbart,"Popular homosexual YouTuber Calum McSwiggan reportedly faked an alleged hate crime attack on himself in West Hollywood on Monday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. [“Last night was the worst night of my life and I’m really struggling to find the words to talk about it. After one of the most wonderful weekends at VidCon we went out to a gay club to celebrate, and towards the end of the evening I was separated from my friends and beaten up by three guys,” claimed McSwiggan on his Instagram account, along with a picture showing him in a hospital.  “The authorities should have been there to help and protect me but instead they treated me like a second class citizen,” he claimed. “With three broken teeth and six stitches in my forehead, I’ve never felt so terrified to be a gay man in the public eye. All I can do is thank my wonderful friends @riyadhk, @melaniiemurphy and @douga_ for being with me the whole way. ” The post garnered thousands of likes and comments of support, however a different story was soon revealed. Captain Holly M. Perez of the West Hollywood Police Station claims that they “were unable to substantiate the assault” and that McSwiggan “had no visible injuries” at their time of investigation. Police soon arrested McSwiggan however after he was seen by deputies vandalizing a car, and the YouTuber ended up being processed with a mugshot and given a cell for the night. West Hollywood Police officers “then observed [McSwiggan] injuring himself with the handle and receiver to a payphone inside the cell. ” After breaking his teeth and piercing his forehead, McSwiggan was quickly sent to the local hospital. “Medical personnel were summoned and Mr. McSwiggan was transported to a local hospital for treatment,” claims the police statement. It was then that the YouTuber posted a picture of his injuries, whilst his mugshot shows him in a healthy and unharmed condition. “Mr. McSwiggan’s booking photo was taken prior to deputies seeing Mr. McSwiggan injuring himself,” reported the police station in a statement to The Advocate, confirming the captain’s claims that McSwiggan was unharmed at the time of his arrest. “I saw Cal screaming crying after the attack. He didn’t fake it,” wrote one of McSwiggan’s friends in a tweet, acknowledging that he didn’t witness the actual events. “I’ve been told to say nothing before court tomorrow but staying silent here is killing us. If you’re a friend just DM me for the truth,” announced McSwiggan on Twitter last night, before refusing to tweet anything else. Since the police statement has surfaced, McSwiggan has received hundreds of angry comments and replies from the public who have expressed disappointment in the YouTuber. “Shame on you for trying to victimize yourself for attention,” commented one user on the Instagram picture. “You are a very ill person and are in need of serious mental help. I hope you seek it out,” wrote another. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech and former editor of the Squid Magazine.

Second North Carolina Poll Confirms Donald Trump’s Solid Tar Heel Lead Over Hillary Clinton - Breitbart,"NEW YORK  —   A second poll from the Tar Heel state in as many days confirms that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is leading his Democrat Hillary Clinton. [This poll, from The Trafalgar Group (TFG) shows Trump up by about five percent over Clinton —  specifically, a lead of 4. 97 percent —  outside the survey’s 2. 88 percent margin of error. Trump, at 49. 13 percent, leads Clinton at 44. 16 percent. Libertarian Gary Johnson gets 3. 59 percent and the Green Party’s Dr. Jill Stein gets 0. 49 percent, while 2. 63 percent are undecided. The survey was conducted from Oct. 27 through Nov. 1, with a sample size of 1, 154 likely voters. That means the poll was partially conducted before FBI director James Comey announced he was reopening the criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email scandal.  Pollster Robert Cahaly, TFG’s senior strategist, said that he thinks there is a   undercurrent of Trump support in key battleground states. “It’s our belief that there is a significant ‘Brexit’ type undercurrent of support for Trump that many polls are not capturing,” Cahaly said. “We have been asking a second ballot test question to measure who survey takers believe most their neighbors will vote for. In our Ohio, Florida, and this North Carolina survey we find a consistent pattern of Clinton support dropping  % while Trump support increases 4. . 5% for this question. ” “We believe the most accurate measure of support for each candidate is somewhere between how people answer for themselves and answer on behalf of their neighbors,” Cahaly added. “Lastly we have noted that there will likely be a major influx of participation from registered voters who haven’t voted since 2006 or before,” Cahaly also said. “This mobilization is reminiscent to the Obama turnout of 2008. These voters’ primary motivation is the rejection of the establishment, just as the Obama ’08 voters who rejected the establishment of that time. ” Trump does even better than the original numbers when respondents are asked whom they think their neighbor supports. In that question, Trump gets 54 percent even —  and Clinton drops to just 39. 88 percent. This is the second survey in as many days that has shown Trump breaking through in North Carolina into the lead. The   poll out on Tuesday showed Trump over 50 percent for the first time in North Carolina, leading Clinton by seven points —  well outside the margin of error. That survey had Trump up 51 percent to Clinton’s 44 percent. This all comes as early voting numbers suggest that Clinton is in serious trouble in the Tar Heel state, as the black community is not coming out to vote for her like they did for President Barack Obama in 2012 and 2008. Republican Mitt Romney won North Carolina in 2012, but even Obama is admitting now that black turnout in the state is way down. Obama is making two trips to North Carolina for Clinton in the final week of the campaign, and the Clinton campaign has strategically made the state its Waterloo as it’s bringing out the heaviest firepower it has there. North Carolina has 15 electoral votes, and if Trump can lock those in, along with Florida’s 29 electoral votes —  as well as the states he already seems to have in Nevada, Ohio, and Iowa —  he will be, along with the red states, at around 265 electoral votes, just shy of the 270 mark. Trump is trending upward in polls in Michigan, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Wisconsin and more in the final hours of a tumultuous campaign as Clinton finds herself under dueling FBI investigations. The FBI has reopened the criminal investigation into Clinton’s illicit   email server she set up in violation of State Department guidelines, and has been —  as was confirmed by a bevy of reports on Wednesday evening —  investigating the Clinton Foundation for over a year now."
"8,000 Colorado Inmates Given Computer Tablets with Games, Books, Music - Breitbart","8, 000 prison inmates in Colorado have been given computer tablets with the ability to call loved ones from the inside, play games, read books, and listen to music. [“Until February, Andrew Stiern could only speak with his girlfriend on a phone in a prison day hall while 10 other inmates listened in and waited impatiently in line behind him,” reported The Denver Post . “Now the    inmate can kick back in the limited privacy of his cell at Four Mile Correctional Center in Cañon City and call his girl on a new computer tablet anytime between 6 a. m. and 10 p. m. He can also use the same device to listen to his favorite tunes from a streaming cache of 12 million songs, read books or play video games to his heart’s content. ”  GTL Corp’s Inspire pilot program seeks to distribute tablets to over 18, 000 prison inmates, and eventually to every prisoner in the United States, according to The Denver Post. It is reportedly “designed to give inmates access to a wide range of media, including educational programming, but also creates a new revenue stream for GTL, which specializes in inmate telecommunications and payment systems. ” “It’s great. I’m kind of the tablet rep guy,” said inmate Andrew Stiern to The Post. “When you are in prison, you are cut off from the outside world. You want your mind to be focused on positive things. It’s kind of an escape from this world. These tabs have become a new piece of life in here. ” Though some believe that the tablets could help deflate friction between prison gangs over prison phone use, other correctional officers and victims group representatives are skeptical of the program. “I’m a little stunned. They are not there to be catered to and offered all the comforts of home,” said Rob Wells, the president of Families of Victims of Homicide and Missing Persons. “I’m not pleased with it. Some of them are gang members and have been involved in some pretty nasty stuff. They shouldn’t be given something that will give them an opportunity to continue their criminal enterprises in prison. How are they going to monitor this?” “All of us had our reservations at first. Are we going to be more vulnerable because of this technology?” asked corrections officer Ryan Flores. “There was a lot of old school mentality. ” Though GTL are giving out the tablets    to prisoners, there is a potential profit to be made through their use. A   subscription for one prisoner to access a database of music and games costs $6. 59, while text messages are 25 cents each. A   phone call costs around $2 to $3. As well as entertainment and education, the tablets can also be used to file complaints, order snacks, contact medical staff, and sign up for prison programs. Despite their ability to contact others outside of the prison, the tablets are not connected to the internet, and inmates are unable to contact others in the prison through the devices. There are also no violent video games available. “These are games I allow my    to play,” said one inmate to The Post. “The most violent game is, like, ‘Angry Birds. ’” Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

Making Artificial Organs with a Cotton Candy Machine - Breitbart,"NASHVILLE, Feb. 9 (UPI)  —   The mechanics of a cotton candy machine are proving useful to the quest to build   artificial organs. [Capillaries are the body’s most narrow blood vessels. The   tubes are essential to organs, delivering oxygen and nutrients and carrying away waste. They also serve is a kind of scaffolding, their woven structure organizing the collection of liver or kidney cells.  Engineers at Vanderbilt University have been experimenting with cotton candy machines as a means to weave   structures using hydrogels. Unlike solid polymers,   gels allow vital fluids to flow through the structure more easily, mimicking the role of the tiny vessels. It’s possible to build capillary scaffolding from the bottom up by culturing cells in a thin film of gel and allowing vessels to began forming on their own, but the process is slow and delicate.  Spinning hydrogel channels from a cotton candy machine  —   the   approach  —   is much faster. “So far the other   approaches have only managed to create networks with microchannels larger than 100 microns, about ten times the size of capillaries,” Leon Bellan, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Vanderbilt, said in a press release. “In addition, many of these other techniques are not able to form networks as complex as the cotton candy approach. ” While the cotton candy machine’s mechanics for spinning   fiber networks proved ideal, finding the right material wasn’t as easy. The scaffolding material has to be both water soluble and insoluble. “First, the material has to be insoluble in water when you make the mold so it doesn’t dissolve when you pour the gel,” Bellan said. “Then it must dissolve in water to create the microchannels because cells will only grow in aqueous environments. ” That’s where PNIPAM, Poly ( ) come in. It’s a polymer that’s insoluble above 32 degrees Celsius and soluble below 32 degrees. Researchers build their artificial organ by spinning out a network of PNIPAM threads at warmer temperature. They then pour on a hydogel embedded with cells. The gelatinous mass is cooled, which causes the threads to dissolve, leaving behind a system of microchannels into which live cell cultures are pumped. “Our experiments show that, after seven days, 90 percent of the cells in a scaffold with perfused microchannels remained alive and functional compared to only 60 to 70 percent in scaffolds that were not perfused or did not have microchannels,” Bellan said. The initial successes of Bellan and his colleagues are detailed in new paper published in the journal Advanced Healthcare Materials. Next, Bellan and his research partners will work to   the process and match the cell types and structure of specific organs."

British Girl Who Joined ISIS Is Reported Killed in Airstrike - The New York Times,"One of the three London schoolgirls who made headlines last year when they fled their homes to join the Islamic State extremist group in Syria is believed to have been killed by a Russian airstrike, a British television channel reported on Thursday. The ITV News channel also said that the girl, Kadiza Sultana, 17, had become “disillusioned with life in the medieval terror state” and had been planning to return to Britain. Kadiza is believed to have been in a residential building in Raqqa, the Islamic State’s de facto capital in northeast Syria, when it was hit in May by a bomb thought to have been dropped by a Russian warplane, ITV said in an article on its website. ITV said its report was based on communications with her relatives in London, with unidentified contacts in Raqqa and with a lawyer for her family, Tasnime Akunjee, who the report said had been working on an escape plan for her. The report said her family had been “informed of Kadiza’s reported death by other people in Raqqa and confirmed details in a statement to ITV News. ” It quoted her sister, Halima, as saying: “We were expecting this, in a way. But at least we know she is in a better place. ” Kadiza’s relatives could not immediately be reached for comment. Mr. Akunjee, in a telephone interview, confirmed the substance of the ITV account but said he did not know with certainty whether she had been killed. “This did not come from any official sources,” he said. “I can’t tell you where the information came from. I suspect it’s true. But I don’t know for a fact that it’s true. Nobody knows for sure anything, because it’s a war zone. ” Kadiza and her companions, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum, who were both 15 when they joined the Islamic State in February 2015, became symbols of the organization’s ability to lure foreign women to its militant jihadist cause. Prohibited from engaging in combat, the women support the group’s goal of building a caliphate by becoming wives, mothers, recruiters and online cheerleaders of its violent acts. According to a May 2015 report by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a   research group that studies extremism, the Islamic State had recruited an estimated 4, 000 Western foreign fighters and migrants, including more than 550 women. The disappearance of the girls,   students who had kept secret their desire to join the Islamic State, took their families by surprise and stunned the nation. The three became known as the Bethnal Green schoolgirls, after the east London neighborhood where they grew up. Their relatives made desperate public pleas for help, and some traveled to Istanbul. They hoped to follow their trail for more information after it had become clear that the girls had flown to Turkey and caught a bus to the border with Syria, where they were smuggled into territory held by the Islamic State. ITV said it was believed all three had wed foreign recruits, not Syrian members. It said Kadiza’s husband was thought to have been an American citizen of Somali descent who died late in 2015."
"Vincent Viola, Nominee for Army Secretary, Drops Out - The New York Times","Vincent Viola, a billionaire Wall Street trader and President Trump’s nominee for secretary of the Army, abruptly withdrew his name for the post on Friday night after concluding it would be too difficult to untangle himself from his business ties, two government officials said. Mr. Viola is an owner of the Florida Panthers hockey club and a majority shareholder in Virtu Financial and Eastern Air Lines, among a number of other business interests. This week The New York Times reported that Mr. Viola had been negotiating to swap his stake in Eastern Air Lines for a stake in Swift Air, an airline with government subcontracts. If his nomination had continued, he would have faced certain scrutiny for potentially becoming a government official who benefits from federal contracts. The Trump administration did not announce his withdrawal, which was reported earlier on Friday by Bloomberg News, but a senior administration official and a Pentagon official separately confirmed his decision, which the White House accepted Friday. Both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Viola is a 1977 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, and he last served in the Army Reserves at the rank of major. He remained connected to the military through donations to West Point, including to the academy’s Combating Terrorism Center. A former Pentagon official and close friend said Mr. Viola was devastated over having to withdraw from what he described as a lifelong dream job. But the former official said Mr. Viola felt he was unable to sell his interest in some of his holdings because doing so could have destroyed those companies. His decision followed weeks of negotiations between his lawyers and the government as they sought to find a solution. Ultimately, they could not. Mr. Viola has a net worth of almost $1. 8 billion and is a   of Virtu. Virtu had planned to go public in 2014, but pulled the plug on the move because of choppy markets and lingering questions around how   trading firms like Virtu make money. In a regulatory filing at the time, Virtu said regulators were looking into its trading practices. It is not known if this issue played a role in Mr. Viola’s decision to withdraw his name for the Army secretary job, which is a post that requires Senate confirmation. His decision to withdraw comes the same week another of Mr. Trump’s appointees, Anthony Scaramucci, was told he would not get a top job at the White House amid concerns about the recent sale of his company to a large Chinese conglomerate. In an episode unrelated to the finances of Mr. Viola, it was recently revealed that he was involved in an altercation in August: He was accused of punching a concessions worker at a racehorse auction in Saratoga Springs, N. Y. No charges were brought against him. Mr. Viola was one of the first nominations Mr. Trump issued the day he was inaugurated. “Vincent Viola, everybody likes Vincent,” Mr. Trump said just hours after his   as he signed orders nominating his cabinet."
"With Carly Fiorina Pick, Cruz Dominates California GOP Convention","In choosing former   CEO Carly Fiorina as his running mate, Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) has achieved a small but significant scheduling coup: he will now dominate the whole second day of the California Republican Convention this weekend. [Fiorina was already scheduled to give the convention’s final address, on Saturday evening. Cruz is scheduled to speak during the day. That will give the   ticket a full day to make their case to California’s Republican voters.  Frontrunner Donald Trump is scheduled to address the convention first on Friday, while Ohio Gov. John Kasich, running a distant third, is scheduled to deliver a speech on Friday evening. Unlike other state parties, the California Republican Party does not select its delegates to the Republican National Convention (RNC) at its state meeting. Rather, each candidate presents the party with a slate of delegates and alternates, who will attend the RNC in Cleveland in July if their campaign wins the congressional district they are assigned to represent. However, the convention will be crucial in setting the tone for the decisive   primary. Trump will arrive with several recent primary victories in hand, but Cruz hopes that selecting Fiorina  —   who hails from the Golden State, and ran for Senate there in 2010  —   will help him build momentum. As of this writing, neither Trump nor Kasich seems to be prepared to announce a vice presidential pick in the near future. If they did so, it is unlikely the California convention would be able to schedule additional time for their running mates. Fiorina was scheduled to address the meeting long before this week’s events. As drama builds on the Republican side, Democrats are starting to feel a sense of inevitability about Hillary Clinton’s progress against Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ). On Wednesday, the Sanders campaign reportedly began laying off field staff. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

"Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte: ’Trump Is a Realist, a Pragmatic Thinker’","Speaking at a news conference in Qatar, Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte compared himself to U. S. President Donald Trump as a leader criticized for bold speech, but he praised Trump as “a realist and a pragmatic thinker. ”[“Trump is profound even if he does not seem to be one. Just like me, I am not that bright but I am very deliberate. I really think it over before I curse at you,” Duterte said.  “Have you seen his building? How can he be stupid?” he exclaimed, referring to Trump Tower in New York City. Duterte went on to claim that Trump told him he was “doing it right” in his exceptionally vigorous campaign against the illegal drug trade, performing a passable impression of Donald Trump speaking those very words over the telephone. Duterte’s opinion of Trump’s predecessor was much lower, but the new American president may have mixed feelings about these words of support, especially those concerning the Philippines drug war. On Tuesday, Reuters published a report from senior officers claiming that the Philippine police have “received cash payments for executing drug suspects, planted evidence at crime scenes and carried out most of the killings they have long blamed on vigilantes. ” “It is the Philippine National Police doing it. This killing machine must be buried six feet under the ground,” one of the whistleblowers declared. Reuters quotes an estimate from human rights monitors that almost 9, 000 people have been killed in the drug war since Duterte took office last year, only about a third of them shot by officers in  . The rest were said to have been murdered by paid assassins or police acting as vigilantes. According to the report, a bounty of about $200 a head has been placed on “drug suspects, rapists, pickpockets, swindlers, gang members, alcoholics, and other ‘troublemakers. ’” These claims are still being evaluated by the Philippines Commission on Human Rights. Reuters notes there is little documentary evidence in the report for its most explosive allegations, and it segues into a political document criticizing Duterte for Communist ties, portraying Duterte’s “social cleansing” of drug addicts to Chairman Mao’s murderous purges in China. This new report from security insiders is hardly the first criticism of Duterte’s drug crackdown. None of that criticism seems to have shaken Duterte’s support very much. On Tuesday, the Washington Post took stock of politics in the Philippines and found what the American paper clearly viewed as surprisingly strong support for Duterte, “from the   elite circles that the unapologetically populist president attacks so aggressively to poor neighborhoods experiencing violence firsthand. ” His backers give their president credit for tackling corruption, hold drug gangs responsible for most of the deaths in the drug war, fear the damage done by hard drugs to their society, and see Duterte as a great improvement on his predecessors. The Post was especially taken aback by how much support Duterte enjoys from young people  —   especially   young Filipinos living abroad, who worry about their country deteriorating into a morass of crime and drug abuse while they’re away. That is one of the reasons Duterte was visiting Qatar when he praised President Trump: he was touching base with the expatriate Filipino community during a   state visit with the emir. He even made time to cover some pop songs from back home for the cheering crowd."
New York explosion leaves dozens injured in Chelsea,"New York (CNN) Police are hunting for answers on what caused an explosion that injured 29 people in New York’s Chelsea neighborhood, shortly before a second suspicious device was found nearby. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters early indications are that the explosion at 23rd Street and 6th Avenue in Manhattan at about 8. 30 p. m. Saturday ”was an intentional act.” But, he said, ”there’s no specific and credible threat against New York City at this time from any terror organization.” New York blast ’obviously an act of terrorism,’ Cuomo says, Investigators believe the blast was caused by an explosive device in or near a dumpster, a law enforcement source told CNN. They are looking at surveillance video that appears to show a person near where the explosion occurred, in an attempt to determine if that individual is connected to the blast. Police have increased security across New York’s five boroughs as a precaution, a law enforcement source told CNN.  Suspicious device found nearby, Just blocks away from the explosion, a suspicious device was found at 27th Street, according to multiple local and federal law enforcement officials. The object was a pressure cooker with dark colored wiring protruding, connected by silver duct tape to what appears to be a cellphone, officials said. A piece of paper with writing on it was found nearby. None of the officials would say at this point what was inside the pressure cooker, which has since been removed from the scene. Pressure cookers were used as explosive devices in the Boston Marathon bombing that killed three people and injured more than 260 in 2013. Police officers and federal agents were scouring the streets with flashlights, robots and dogs early Sunday to ensure there were no other devices in the area. Attention focused on another object in the area, but it turned out to be trash. De Blasio says they also believe there is no specific connection to an earlier incident in New Jersey, where an explosion went off in a garbage can on the route of a Marine Corps charity run.  ’I just blacked out’   people were injured in the New York explosion, one of them critically, officials say. Among the injured were David Martinez and Brenda Abero, who spoke to CNN after they were discharged from New York’s Bellevue Hospital. Both said they were lucky to be alive. Martinez said the couple were driving through Chelsea when their car was lifted up by the force of the blast, damaging the left side of the vehicle. ”I was driving a car and next thing you know I felt an explosion,” he said. ”I just blacked out, next thing I know I’m in an ambulance.” Martinez, who suffered injuries to his head and leg, was feeling ”pain, a little traumatized,” he said. ”Thought I was close to not seeing my son again, that was the scariest part.” Abero, who is pregnant, said her baby was uninjured. Ambulances arriving at some local hospitals were being checked by armed guards.  How it all unfolded, Surveillance video from the explosion in Chelsea shows windows shattered with terrified people running on the streets and ducking. The video, which shows angles from inside and outside Orangetheory Fitness in Chelsea, shows a screen laying outside on the street after the explosion and what appears to be papers flying in the air.  Danilo Gabrielli, a    Chelsea resident, was watching TV at his 23rd street apartment about a block away from the explosion site when he heard the blast. ”It was a huge explosion. It shook the entire apartment building,” he said. He and others went to see what had happened: ”People from my building and I were literally the first people there.” The scene, he said, was ”very chaotic.”  ”We smelled something, like an intense sulfur smell, and saw smoke coming out of this building. I saw pieces of metal    not large, but not small either. A few friends of mine saw glass there.” Gabrielli says ”the entire neighborhood is real scared.” ”It’s a real quiet neighborhood    not like the center of the city or the Wall Street area. It’s tiny bars, where you go to grab a drink, grab a bite to eat, watch a film. We were worried.” An eyewitness told CNN affiliate NY1 he was having dinner when the explosion rocked the area. ”[I] felt a loud explosion and I felt like a lightning bolt struck the building. It, like, shook the ground,” he told NY1. ”Everybody ran out of the restaurant into the street. The whole city was in the street.” Some social media users said the sound of the explosion was heard as far away as Hoboken, New Jersey, across the Hudson River from Chelsea. Busy nightlife area, Chelsea is packed with restaurants, subway stations, shops, businesses and art galleries and normally buzzing on a weekend night. 23rd street, where the explosion occurred, is in the heart of Chelsea, CNN’s Richard Quest explains. It is not as bohemian as many have thought in previous times, Quest says. He notes Chelsea is one of the most expensive areas in the city now because of wealthy people moving to the area.  Chelsea is also still very much regarded and known for its inclusion of the gay community and the gay bars in the area, Quest says. He notes one of the most famous fashion colleges, FIT, is just blocks away."
"UNESCO Approves Motion Denying Jewish, Christian Links to Temple Mount","The Times of Israel reports: An important panel at the United Nations Educational, Cultural and Scientific Organization (UNESCO) on Wednesday morning approved a controversial resolution that ignores Jewish and Christian ties to the Temple Mount. [The decision came a week after a similar resolution was approved by the body and elicited angry responses from Israel, several world leaders and even the body’s own  .  Convening at its annual meeting in Paris, UNESCO’s World Heritage Committee adopted Draft Resolution 40COM 7A. 13, entitled “Old City of Jerusalem and its Walls,” by a large majority, with 10 countries voting in favor, eight abstaining and two opposing the text. Eight “yes” votes were needed for the resolution to pass. Jamaica was absent and did not participate in the vote. The resolution, which accuses Israel of various violations, echoed last week’s decision in referring to the Temple Mount compound solely by its Muslim names, “     ” and defined it only as “a Muslim holy site of worship. ” As the site of the two Biblical temples, the mount is the holiest place in Judaism. But unlike last week’s resolution, the draft did not mention the importance of Jerusalem’s Old City for “the three monotheistic religions. ” Read more here."
Venezuela Takes CNN en Español – But Not English-Language CNN – Off the Air - Breitbart,"The socialist government of Venezuela has prohibited CNN en Español from broadcasting nationwide following a report exposing a Venezuelan plot to grant passports to Hezbollah terrorists. CNN International, which broadcasts more   programming, remains available. [Local newspaper El Nacional reported Wednesday that CNN en Español went off the air in Venezuela around 5:00 PM local time. The move followed dictator Nicolás Maduro demanding that CNN leave the country in a televised rant on Sunday which did not explicitly refer to its latest investigative report accusing Maduro of approving a plan to secure Venezuelan documentation for Middle Eastern terrorists.  The Venezuelan socialist government issued a statement through Foreign Minister Delcy Rodríguez on the matter. “The owners of the CNN television network lack morals,” she asserted, condemning the passport report as “at the service of the political agendas of the United States. ” The CNN report centered on the testimony of Misael López Soto, a former official at the Venezuelan embassy in Baghdad. López fled Iraq in 2015 after being pressured to issue birth certificates and passports to   nationals with ties to Hezbollah. CNN caught up with López, whose story had not changed in two years. López claimed the Venezuelan embassy charged foreigners up to $15, 000 per passport, and emphasized that these were not counterfeit documents, but legal Venezuelan documents improperly produced for   nationals. CNN en Español issued a statement condemning the censorship of the broadcast. “At CNN en Español we believe in the vital role that freedom of press plays in a healthy democracy  …     CNN en Español will continue to fulfill its responsibility to the Venezuelan public by offering our live signal on YouTube free of charge and news links on CNNEspanol. com. ” The network’s broadcast on Wednesday night focused on the Venezuelan socialist dictatorship’s oppression of human rights. Anchor Fernando del Rincón used Twitter to distribute online links for watching the network within Venezuela and featured a variety of human rights advocates on his program. Among them was Human Rights Watch’s José Miguel Vivanco, who called the censorship “ridiculous” and decried Maduro’s government as a “mafia” using the government to hide its ties with   organizations. Del Rincón also lent his platform to Lilian Tintori, wife of Venezuelan political prisoner Leopoldo López. Maduro’s courts sentenced López to 13 years in prison for organizing a peaceful protest in 2014. Tintori used the airwaves to express solidarity with CNN en Español, asserting, “no censorship can obscure the truth. ” She added that, during her meeting Wednesday with President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and Senator Marco Rubio, “I felt at the White House that their priority in foreign policy is Venezuela. ” Trump himself, she added, was “very concerned” about human rights in her native country. While CNN en Español is no longer available in Venezuela, its   counterpart remains untouched, according to Venezuelans on social media. CNN confirmed this finding in their announcement of the removal of CNN en Español from Venezuelan airwaves. Listo, ya sacaron a @CNNEE de DirecTV en Venezuela. Estaba entre el 700 y el 706. pic. twitter.   —   Humberto Perozo S. (@kikoperozo) February 15, 2017,   CNN International’s   broadcasts have pleased Maduro significantly more than CNN en Español historically. “CNN is always welcome to Venezuela,” Maduro told CNN interviewer Christiane Amanpour in 2014, shortly after threatening to expel CNN en Español. Amanpour used the opportunity to interview Maduro to ask, “What keeps you up at night?”"
Mission Accomplished: Consumer Sentiment Plummets After Comey Hearing - Breitbart,"Consumer sentiment unexpectedly dropped in June to the lowest level since the presidential election in November, according to the University of Michigan’s monthly survey. [The widely watched consumer sentiment metric fell to 94. 5 in June from 97. 1 in May. Economists had expected a slight increase.  Prior to the testimony of former Federal Bureau of Investigation chief James Comey, sentiment had been headed in the expected direction. It was averaging a score of 97. 7, the University of Michigan researchers said. Then Comey testified and consumer sentiment plunged. Since June 8, the index registered a score of 86. 7, a huge 11 point decline. The decline was observed across the political spectrum but was more pronounced among Republicans and independents. “While this break corresponds with James Comey’s testimony, only a few consumers spontaneously referred to him or his testimony when asked to explain their views. Importantly, the decline was observed across all political parties, but the loss in confidence among   Republicans since June 8th was larger than among Democrats (9. 2 vs. 6. 8  ) with Independents showing the greatest falloff (11. 5  ),” the University of Michigan researchers said. In short, following the Comey testimony, consumers are far less optimistic about the economy."

PGA Championship: Jimmy Walker wins first major title," (CNN) Jimmy Walker won his first major title with victory in the PGA Championship at Baltusrol, beating reigning champion Jason Day by one shot. In a dramatic finish, Day gave himself a great chance of retaining his title with an eagle at the last hole but Walker held his nerve to   for par and the coveted Wanamaker Trophy. ”Sometimes things don’t come easy and golf isn’t an easy game,” Walker said following Sunday’s win in Springfield, New Jersey. ”Day is a great champion and I wouldn’t expect anything else    eagle at the last.  ”I had to make par, pars are hard but I made it.” Despite appearing calm and collected throughout a   back nine, Walker admitted he felt the tension out on the course.  ”There’s a lot of emotion going on out there, I’m not gonna lie. It’s tough, it’s amazing.” On the penultimate hole, Day missed a good chance for birdie to close the gap on Walker to one shot, something he would go on to rue. The world No. 1 then opted for an iron off the 18th tee and followed it up with an exquisite approach shot that gave him the chance to finish his round with an eagle. On his walk to the final green, Day threw his club in frustration as he heard the roar from behind him, signaling another Walker birdie at the 17th. Walker’s birdie putt looked to be missing right, but the stars aligned for the   astrophotographer    and the hole gathered the ball in. It appeared as though the    slightly   his first putt on the 18th green, leaving himself with a tough   to secure the title. But in truth, the par was never in doubt as Walker completed a   final round of 67. ”It feels sweet, it’s amazing,” Walker told Sky Sports after his triumph. ”I felt like something clicked last week and I brought it in this week.” He had played 187 tournaments before winning his first PGA Tour title in 2014, when he also had three   finishes in majors. Walker won twice last year to take his title tally to five, but the Oklahoma native hadn’t been tipped as a contender at Baltusrol after missing the cut at the U. S. Open, Players Championship and British Open. His victory means that, for the first time in five years, all four of the year’s majors have gone to   winners. Like this story? Get more at cnn.  Walker didn’t hit a golf ball Saturday after bad weather forced play to be abandoned, instead returning Sunday morning to shoot 68 and take a   lead over Day into the final round. ”It’s surreal, it really is,” Walker said of his maiden major win. ”I’m having a hard time putting words to it now.”"
Trump gets it right on Saddam," (CNN) Occasionally Donald Trump says something that is politically incorrect but which also happens to be true.  On Tuesday at a campaign rally in North Carolina, Trump defended the former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein’s record on terrorism, saying, ”He was a bad guy    really bad guy. But you know what? He did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so well. They didn’t read them the rights. They didn’t talk. They were terrorists. Over. Today, Iraq is Harvard for terrorism.”  Defending the brutal Iraqi dictator who killed hundreds of thousands of his own people isn’t exactly fashionable. But if you consider the 13 years of war that have wracked the country    in which a quarter of a million have died    and add that Saddam brutally repressed all dissent, including groups such as al Qaeda, and also add to this that ISIS is itself a fruit of the Iraq War, it’s a far more defensible position.    Trump didn’t offer any evidence for his assertions about Saddam’s brutal repression of terrorist groups or of Saddam ”killing terrorists,” but his observations about the dictator are an implicit critique of the George W. Bush administration’s erroneous claims before the Iraq War that Saddam was allied to al Qaeda. Those claims were an essential element of the case that the administration made to go to war, since Saddam’s supposed connections to al Qaeda were the only purported evidence that he might give his putative weapons of destruction to terrorists.  The centerpiece of the Bush administration’s case for going to war in Iraq was Secretary of State Colin Powell’s presentation to the U. N. Security Council on February 5, 2003, six weeks before the invasion. Powell’s presentation was a bravura performance that seemed to establish beyond a doubt that Saddam was actively concealing an ongoing weapons of mass destruction program and was in league with  .   At one point the secretary of state dramatically brandished a small vial of a white powder of supposed anthrax, saying ”about this amount. ..shut down the U. S. Senate in the fall of 2001.” As Powell gave his speech, sitting directly behind him was CIA director George Tenet, giving a visual imprimatur to what Powell was saying.   One section of Powell’s UN speech tried to make the case for an emerging alliance between Saddam and  :  ”Iraq today harbors a deadly terrorist network headed by Abu Musab   an associate and collaborator of Osama bin Laden and his   lieutenants. ..When our coalition ousted the Taliban, the Zarqawi network helped establish another poison and explosive training center camp, and this camp is located in northeastern Iraq. .. He traveled to Baghdad in May of 2002 for medical treatment, staying in the capital of Iraq for two months while he recuperated to fight another day.” Five weeks before the invasion of Iraq, CIA director Tenet testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that Iraq had ”provided training in poisons and gases to two   associates,” a point that Powell had also made in his U. N. presentation.  What the American public did not know about Tenet’s and Powell’s crucial claim about Iraq training   associates on poison gases was that it didn’t show a nexus between bin Laden, Saddam and some of the world’s nastiest weapons. Instead, it was the tainted fruit of an ”extraordinary rendition” in which militants were transported by American officials to countries that routinely used torture, where they would supposedly finally divulge whatever secrets they had been keeping from their American interrogators. In December 2001 Ibn al Shaykh al Libi, a Libyan militant who had run an    training camp, was captured in Pakistan. Libi told his FBI interrogators that there were no ties between Saddam and  . Several days into his interrogation the CIA then rendered Libi to Egypt, where jailors were known for subjecting their prisoners to beatings, electric shocks and sexual assaults.  To improve his chances of better treatment once in Egypt, Libi told his interrogators that bin Laden had sent two operatives to Iraq to learn about biological and chemical weapons.   Because Libi’s story encapsulated the key arguments for the Iraq war, his tale was picked up by President Bush in a keynote speech in Cincinnati on October 7, 2002 in which he laid out his rationale for the coming conflict with Iraq, saying, ”We’ve learned that Iraq has trained   members in   and poisons and deadly gases.”  But once he was back in American custody, on February 14, 2004, Libi recanted what he had falsely told his Egyptian interrogators. Libi told his U. S. interrogators that he had ”fabricated” his tale of the     connection to the Egyptians following ”physical abuse and threats of torture.” Two and a half years into the Iraq war, in October 2005, the CIA released a report that finally disposed of the myth that Saddam and the leader of   in Iraq, Zarqawi, had ever been in league, assessing that prior to the war, ”the regime did not a have a relationship, harbor, or turn a blind eye towards Zarqawi.”   Since the fall of Baghdad no documents have been unearthed in Iraq proving the    axis despite the fact that, like other totalitarian regimes, Saddam’s government kept meticulous records. The Defense Intelligence Agency had by 2006 translated 34 million pages of documents from Saddam’s Iraq and found there was nothing to substantiate a ”partnership” between Saddam and  . Two years later the Pentagon’s own internal think tank, the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) concluded after examining 600, 000   documents and several thousand hours of his regime’s audio and video tapes that there was no ”smoking gun (i. e. direct connection between Saddam’s Iraq and  . )”  Join us on Facebook. .  In June 2008 the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concluded, as every other investigation had before, that there was no ”cooperative relationship” between Saddam and  . The committee also found that ”most of the contacts cited between Iraq and  ’ida before the war by the intelligence community and policy makers have been determined not to have occurred.”  Also on Wednesday, after a   investigation, the British inquiry into the Iraq War known as the Chilcot report was released. It found that before the war British intelligence repeatedly assessed there was no connection between Iraq and al Qaeda.  Trump is likely not a student of the English political philosopher Hobbes, who wrote his masterwork ”Leviathan” in the shadow of the English Civil War. But he seems to have grasped Hobbes’ main point: that an absolute ”sovereign” (i. e. dictator) was preferable to ”the war of all against all” that characterized the civil war in   century England as well as much of the civil war that continues to wrack   century Iraq.  And Trump’s claim that following the fall of Saddam, Iraq has emerged as the ”Harvard” of terrorism is correct because Zarqawi in 2004 merged his terrorist group with al Qaeda to create ”Al Qaeda in Iraq,” which is the parent organization of today’s ISIS."

WaPo Reporter: We Had ‘Fun’ Cataloguing World Leaders Who’ve Mocked Trump - Breitbart,"A Washington Post reporter admitted that she and her team had “a little bit of fun” cataloguing all of the foreign leaders who have mocked President Donald Trump in recent weeks.  “We’re having a little bit of fun kinda going through some of the recent examples of world leaders who either feel free to mock trump in public or behind [like] the Australian prime minister,” the Post’s Anne Gearan told MSNBC’s Brian Williams on Friday evening. She gleefully   an article last week titled, “Trump said foreign leaders wouldn’t laugh at the U. S. Now they’re laughing at him. ” The article states that though Trump declared in the Rose Garden while withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord that foreign leaders won’t be “laughing at us,” Trump has since “been the butt of jokes in capitals around the world. ” The article notes that the “trolling is picking up” and points out that Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull recently was caught making fun in a leaked recording. “The Donald and I, we are winning and winning in the polls,” Turnbull reportedly said while mocking Trump. “Not the fake polls. They’re the ones we’re not winning in. We’re winning in the real polls. You know, the online polls. ” As the Post noted, Swedish Deputy Prime Minister Isabella Lovi, Norway Prime Minister Erna Solberg, France’s President Emmanuel Macron and former Mexican President Vicente Fox all have trolled or mocked Trump in recent weeks. It is no surprise that reporters at the Post like seeing Trump mocked. The Post’s Margaret Sullivan, who used to be the New York Times’ public editor, recently asked if the mainstream media were being “terribly unfair” to Trump. Her response? “Hell, no. ” “Politicians have no right to expect equally balanced positive and negative coverage, or anything close to it,” Sullivan wrote. “If a president is doing a rotten job, it’s the duty of the press to report how and why he’s doing a rotten job. ” She added that “the idea of balance is suspect on its face. ” After the Post published leaked information from intelligence officials that alleged President Donald Trump passed along classified intelligence information to the Russians last month, the Post’s newsroom reportedly erupted in cheers as readers kept clicking on the story. The paper’s     Glenn Kessler, immediately Tweeted that there was “Applause in the newsroom as the   scoop breaks the Hollywood Access record for most readers per” second.

S. citizens can come back. That’s existing law. But let me say, Wolf, I really find it amazing that Donald believes that he is the one who discovered the issue of illegal immigration. I can tell you, when I ran for senate here in the state of Texas, I ran promising to lead the fight against amnesty, promising to fight to build a wall, and in 2013, when I was leading the fight against the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, where was Donald? He was firing Dennis Rodman on “Celebrity Apprentice” and indeed, if you look at the Gang of Eight, one individual on this stage broke his promise to the men and women who elected him and wrote the amnesty bill, but Donald funded the Gang of Eight. If you look at the eight members of the Gang of Eight, Donald gave over $50, 000 to three Democrats and two Republicans. And when you’re funding open border politicians, you shouldn’t be surprised when they fight for open borders. And I think if you want to know who actually will secure the borders and follow through, you ought to ask, who has a record before they were a candidate for president, of fighting to secure the borders and stop amnesty, and I’m the only one on this stage that has that record. And by the way, Marco is exactly right, that a federal court found Donald guilty of being part of a conspiracy to hire people illegally and entered a $1 million judgment against him. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN"
"Trump: Netanyahu, Abbas Vowed To ’Reach For Peace’ - And I Believe Them","TEL AVIV  —   President Donald Trump on Saturday said both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas had assured him they were ready to “reach for peace. ”[Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas “assured me he is willing to reach for peace with Israel in good faith, and I believe he will,” Trump told U. S. troops in Sicily, while summarizing his first state visit overseas as a “home run. ”  “Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assured me that he too was ready to reach for peace. He’s a friend of mine and he means it,” Trump said. “All children from all faiths deserve a future of hope and peace, a future that does honor to God,” he added. He also said that he and Netanyahu “continued our discussion about fighting terrorism and crushing the organizations and ideologies that drive it. ” He said that recent terror attacks in the UK and Egypt highlighted the urgency for the U. S. to “defeat terrorism and protect civilization. ” “Terrorism is a threat, bad threat to all of humanity,” Trump said. “And together we will overcome this threat. We will win. ” About Israel, Trump gushed that he was “awed by the majesty and beauty of the Holy Land and the faith and reverence of the devoted people who live there. ” On Sunday, Israel’s Shin Bet security agency said it had arrested six Palestinian men, including three PA policemen, suspected of seven separate shooting attacks against Israeli soldiers."
"GOP Rivals Unite, Rhetorically, Behind Donald Trump’s Demand for a Border Wall - Breitbart","Even Gov. Jeb Bush has now joined the   GOP chorus of rhetorical support for a border wall, following the Pope’s public scolding of Donald Trump’s popular plan for a stronger barrier between the United States and Latin America. [When asked about the pope’s reported comments, Bush said he supports a “wall and fencing,” but then he hedged by saying “where it’s appropriate. ”  Despite the caveat, that’s a big rhetorical change from last August, when Bush scoffed at Trump’s popular plan. Back then, Bush said that, building a wall will cost hundreds of billions of dollars. It’s not realistic, it won’t be implemented. And we need border security to be able to deal with getting this country back on track  …     The simple fact is that his proposal is unrealistic . . . it will violate people’s civil liberties, it will create friction with our third largest trading partner [Mexico] that is not necessary, and I think he’s wrong about this. For many years, progressives and business advocates of greater immigration have strongly opposed a border wall, as well as checks at airports and seaports, despite overwhelming public support. Instead, they’ve backed various alternatives  —   for example, short stretches of light fencing, airborne patrols, surveillance cameras, more ground patrols  —   that have successfully allowed more than 10 million illegal migrants to reach U. S. workplaces and and shops. For example, Bush’s 2016 border platform calls for greater surveillance, not an actual border fence. I come to different conclusions than Mr. Trump and have put forth the most comprehensive and realistic strategy for dealing with the problem of illegal immigration. A great nation must secure its borders for national security and public health reasons. We don’t have to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on fencing when we can use new technology, improve the Border Patrol’s access to streams and rivers on the border [and] beef up our patrols. In his campaign, Bush has also endorsed a larger flow of foreign workers across U. S. borders. In fact, his 2016 economic planform calls for additional immigration to help boost annual economic growth to 4 percent. Trump has repeatedly championed construction of a border wall, and has even insisted that Mexico’s government will pay for the project. But Trump has not actually called for a complete 2, 000 mile wall from   . Instead, he said in August 2015 that, But you also have natural terrain which is automatically a barrier, which is a good thing. So you’re talking about 1, 000. And then you look at the Great Wall of China that was built 2, 500 years ago. It’s 13, 000 miles. And we’re really talking about something more than a little more than 1, 000 miles. So it is something that can be absolutely done, not done at tremendous cost. In August, Sen. Marco Rubio said at a GOP debate that “we need a fence,” but did not say how much of the border it would cover. Rubio’s rhetorical support for a wall came after public opposition blocked his 2013     bill, which did not fund a full border fence, but did create many legal loopholes in the border, including an doubling of legal migrants and a huge increase in the flow of foreign workers. On Thursday, after the pope’s comments hit the media, Rubio responded at a rally in South Carolina saying, “There’s no nation on Earth that’s more compassionate on immigration than we are  …     We accept a million people a year into the U. S. legally, every year,” Rubio said. “Mexico doesn’t do that. No other nation in the world does that. ” When responding to the pope’s comments, Rubio suggested he would support a full wall, but he didn’t use the actual words. “This country does not just have a right but an obligation to control the process by which the people enter the United States and by which people immigrate into the United States,” he said. His immigration policy, does not call for a   border fence or wall. It says Rubio will “finish all 700 miles of walls on our southern border   …     [and] Install $4 billion in new cameras and sensors on the border. ” The “700 mile” phrase likely refers to 2008 law that mandates a fence be built along roughly 700 miles of border. But the mandate does not requires the fence to be a wall, to be   or even be effective. So far, Congress has only provide funding for construction of an effective   fence for part of the supposed   fence, mostly in California. Dr. Ben Carson responded to the pope’s reported comments by saying, “enforcing our immigration laws is not in contradiction with love and kindness. ” In September, Carson backed the construction of a tough border fence, saying, I was in Arizona a few weeks ago at the border. The fences there were not manned. So, I don’t see any purpose in having that. Yuma County, Arizona. They stop 97 percent of the illegal immigrants through there. They put in a double fence with a road so that there was quick access by the enforcement people. If we don’t seal the border, the rest of this stuff clearly doesn’t matter. We have the ability to do it, we don’t have the will to do it. While campaigning in South Carolina, Sen. Ted Cruz evaded reporters’ question on the Pope’s comments. “Listen that’s between Donald and the Pope, I’m not going to get into the middle of that, I’ll leave it to the two of them to work it out. ” Cruz’s border policy calls for a “wall that works,” but does not clearly call for a wall or fence to be constructed along the 2, 000 mile border. The unsecured border with Mexico invites illegal immigrants, criminals, and terrorists to tread on American soil. Millions of people from all over the world, including from hostile nations and terrorist havens, have been apprehended at our southern border  —   and many who make it through are never caught. This is a failure of the highest order. I will fulfill the promise Congress made to the American people almost 10 years ago by completing all 700 miles of priority fencing along the U. S.  border, and dedicate the resources necessary to replace all   fencing along the U. S.  border to build a fence that keeps people out and that is   and law  . If other nations, such as Israel, can build an effective border wall, the United States certainly can. Cruz’s platform also says he “will take a hard look at our   programs to ensure that they provide the most value to the American people. ” However, he does not say he will reduce the annual inflow of  . Under current rules, companies each year legally bring in 700, 000 foreign workers, through the border fences, to take jobs sought by some of the 4 million Americans who turn 18 each year. Gov. John Kasich has also said a fence is required  —   even though he wants to offer an amnesty to illegal immigrants inside the United States, and also allow companies to bring many “guest workers” from overseas. In August, he said on CNN that, First of all, we ought to finish the fence. The 11 million who are here, we ought to find out who they are. If they’ve been law abiding over a period of time they ought to be legalized and ought to be able to stay here. If you have violated the law, we’re going to ship you out. Once that fence gets built, we should make it clear, anybody who sneaks in, you’re going back home. And in addition we need a guest worker program so that people can come in and work and be able to go back to support their family. The   controversy began when the Pope told reporters that “a person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not of building bridges, is not Christian. This is not the Gospel. As far as what you said about whether I would advise to vote or not to vote, I am not getting involved in that. ”    "

"China, Russia condemn North Korea’s missile launch  ","Hong Kong (CNN) China has voiced opposition to North Korea’s test of a reported new ballistic missile more than 24 hours after reports of the launch emerged. But the country shrugged off suggestions it should be doing more to intervene in the rogue state’s military affairs, pinning the test down to Pyongyang’s testy relations with Washington and Seoul. North Korean state media hailed the Sunday test as a success, claiming a previously unpublicized part of the country’s arsenal    a   an   missile    was launched under the supervision of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. North Korea is prohibited from carrying out ballistic missile launches under UN Security Council resolutions aimed in part at curbing the country’s development of nuclear weapons. China’s Foreign Ministry said that his country was opposed to launch activities in violation of the resolutions. ”Under current circumstances, relevant sides should not provoke each other or take actions that would escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula,” ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular press briefing Monday.  ”As I have pointed out repeatedly in the past, the root cause to the North Korea nuclear missile issue is the conflicts between North Korea and the United States, as well as between North and South Korea.” North Korea’s relationship with China    its most important ally    has kept Pyongyang afloat as sanctions have crippled and isolated it from the rest of the world.  But in recent years, China has taken a tougher line on the North Korean nuclear program, voting in favor of UN sanctions and issuing condemnations when it conducts provocative military tests. Russia’s Foreign Ministry also spoke out against the test, the first since US President Donald Trump’s inauguration, saying in a statement that it was in ”defiant disregard” of UN resolutions. Russia and China were both members of the Six Party Talks    a diplomatic attempt to curb North Korea’s nuclear program that started in 2003    along with the US, Japan, and North and South Korea.  ’Clear provocation to Japan’ The United Nations Security Council said it plans to hold consultations on an ”urgent basis” Monday afternoon regarding North Korea, according to the US Mission to the UN.  The meeting was requested by the US, South Korea and Japan    whose Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was visiting President Trump in the US when the missile was fired and landed in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea.  Abe said that the test was ”absolutely intolerable,” while President Trump said that the United States ”stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100%.” Japan’s chief Cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said the fact the launch came as Abe met with Trump made it ”a clear provocation to Japan and the region.” Tokyo has already lodged protests against North Korea via its embassy in Beijing, he said. What can the   do? Sunday’s test has stoked concerns that Pyongyang may be getting closer to a   intercontinental ballistic missile than previously thought.  The   is   state media claims, and can travel from 3, 000 to 5, 500 kilometers (1, 864 to 3, 417 miles). A US official said the missile tested traveled 500 kilometers (310 miles) before landing in the Sea of Japan and that it was launched from North Pyongan province. It is believed to have used a   propelled engine which enables faster launch and increases the mobility of the launch process, according to a spokesman of the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman. The Joint Chiefs also believe that Pyongyang employed a   system, in which the missile is lifted off the ground using pressure and then ignited   as opposed to igniting it on the ground    which is said to be less stable, the spokesman said. Kim expressed satisfaction over ”the possession of another powerful nuclear attack means, which adds to the tremendous might of the country,” state media reported."

Suspect in Orlando officer’s killing indicted ," (CNN) A central Florida grand jury has indicted Markeith Loyd in the shooting deaths of his   in December and Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton in January, prosecutors said Wednesday. Loyd was indicted on 11 counts, including murder, firearm and other charges in the December 13 death of Sade Dixon and the January 9 death of Clayton outside a Walmart, said Aramis Ayala, state attorney for Orange and Osceola counties. ”What my office has not and will not lose sight of is these tragedies all stemmed from domestic violence    and I take domestic violence very seriously,” Ayala said, adding that she has created a specialized unit to combat domestic violence.  Loyd was captured on January 17 after a nationwide manhunt.  Loyd and Dixon had been involved in a relationship and had a child on the way, authorities said. He had been on the run since that shooting at an Orlando residence. On January 9, Clayton received word that Loyd was near the Walmart and tried to confront him.  Police Chief John Mina said the suspect ”basically opened fire on her” as soon as Clayton told him to stop. Loyd continued to shoot Clayton even after she was down, Mina said. Clayton apparently shot the suspect in the chest, but his bulletproof vest stopped the bullet, according to police. There was another death in the case. Orange County Sheriff’s Deputy 1st Class Norman Lewis died in a crash while searching for Loyd on the day of Clayton’s death.  Hundreds of tips poured in and a reward ballooned to $100, 000 in the search.  The manhunt led authorities to an abandoned house in Orlando’s Carver Shores area, where Loyd was captured.  Authorities said Loyd resisted arrest and suffered a fractured left orbital bone and damage to one eye in the process. Loyd said he didn’t resist. Orlando police said it would investigate the amount of force used to apprehend Loyd. Ayala said that case hasn’t been handed over to her office. Clayton was a master sergeant in the Orlando police at the time of her killing she was posthumously promoted. Loyd remains in custody in the Orange County Jail. The six counts involving Dixon’s death are   murder with a firearm killing of an unborn child by injury to a mother attempted first   with a firearm two counts of attempted felony murder with a firearm and one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The counts involving Clayton are   murder of a law enforcement officer with a firearm attempted   murder of a law enforcement officer with a firearm aggravated assault with a deadly weapon carjacking with a firearm and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. It’s unclear whether Ayala’s office would be able to seek the death penalty.  In January 2016, the US Supreme Court ruled that the process used to condemn a Florida death row inmate was unconstitutional because a judge rather than a jury was the final arbiter of fact in sentencing. The   ruling came in a challenge filed by death row inmate Timothy Lee Hurst, who had been convicted of murdering restaurant   Cynthia Harrison in 1998. The case was sent back to the Florida Supreme Court.  Florida legislators then overhauled the law and allowed a defendant to be sentenced to death if 10 of 12 jurors recommended it.  Last fall, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that a death sentence required a unanimous jury vote, striking down the new law. A bill requiring that a jury unanimously recommend the death sentence is currently in the Legislature, CNN affiliate News 13 Orlando reported. If the jury is not unanimous, it can recommend a life sentence without parole.  Ayala said prosecutors are awaiting the outcome of the bill, but will proceed with the case as planned. "
Merkel Will Pay Migrants Millions To Leave Germany,"Chancellor Angela Merkel is setting aside €90m (£76m) in taxpayers’ money to create a fund which will pay migrants to withdraw their asylum applications and leave Germany voluntarily. [The handouts will form part of a   plan to speed up the removal of rejected asylum seekers, after Tunisian migrant Anis Amri murdered a Polish lorry driver, hijacked his vehicle and drove it into a Christmas market in Berlin while awaiting deportation.  U. S. president Donald Trump told The Times that Merkel made a “catastrophic mistake” when she opened the doors to an unlimited number of migrants in 2015. Her   Sigmar Gabriel, later admitted that his superior had underestimated how difficult it would be to integrate migrants on such a grand scale, and that Germany had been plunged into a kulturkampf, or “cultural war” as a result. Germany rejected 170, 000 asylum claims in 2016 but, according to the Mail, just 26, 000 were repatriated. 55, 000 more decided to leave voluntarily  —   apparently leaving 81, 000 bogus applicants unaccounted for. “We rely heavily on voluntary departures,” admitted Chancellor Merkel, who was announcing the package after falling behind the Social Democrats in polls for Germany’s upcoming elections. Martin Schulz, the former President of the European Parliament who has been nominated as the Social Democrat challenger to Merkel, said he backed the proposals to speed up deportations. Schulz has previously insisted that “the people who are arriving [in Europe] are refugees who have been threatened [and] we should welcome them”  —   a statement which is at odds with the   of the European Commission’s admission that at least 60 per cent are economic migrants. As a leading figure in the European Union, Schulz was a strong supporter of the compulsory migrant quotas. These were forced through by the bloc despite strong opposition from central and eastern European   which did not agree with Germany’s unilateral decision to throw open the borders. Schulz hit out strongly at these countries in 2015, accusing them of “national egotism in its purest form”. Polish interior minister Mariusz Blaszczak described at Schulz’s words as “an example of German arrogance”."
Bloomberg’s Joshua Green: Clinton Foundation Foreign Cash Ban ’Win for Peter Schweizer’ - Breitbart,"Bloomberg Businessweek‘s national correspondent Joshua Green called the Clinton presidential campaign’s recent announcement  —   that if Hillary Clinton is elected her family foundation will no longer accept foreign and corporate donations  —   a “win for Peter Schweizer. ”[“Win for @peterschweizer: AP reports Clinton Foundation will bar   donations if Hillary’s elected,” Green posted to Twitter Wednesday.  Win for @peterschweizer: AP reports Clinton Foundation will bar   donations if Hillary’s elected   https:  .   —   Joshua Green (@JoshuaGreen) August 18, 2016,  Green’s hat tip to Schweizer was an acknowledgment that the explosive research found in the Breitbart News Senior   ’s New York Times bestselling book Clinton Cash, is what led to the Clinton’s remarkable course correction. And, to his credit, Schweizer is well aware. “The new pledge is a stunning tacit admission of wrongdoing, but it comes too little too late and raises the obvious question: If it would be wrong for Hillary’s foundation to accept foreign cash as president, why wasn’t it wrong for Hillary’s foundation to accept foreign cash from oligarchs and countries who had business pending on her desk as Sec. of State?” Schweizer wrote on Thursday. Schweizer continued: “Moreover, if, as has been confirmed by numerous mainstream media organizations, Hillary Clinton violated her ethics pledge with the Obama administration to disclose all Clinton Foundation donations, why should the American people believe she would now honor a new pledge to forgo bagging cash from foreign oligarchs and countries?” The Democratic party presidential nominee’s new promise to cease acceptance of foreign donations for her embattled family foundation if she becomes President comes on the heels of news that the Clinton Foundation has been rocked by fears that its internal servers may have been compromised by hackers.

Time to Say Thank You and Goodbye to Sen. McCain - Breitbart,"John McCain was a pilot in Viet Nam and there is no question that he and his fellow POWs suffered immeasurably in the Hanoi Hilton.  For that we owe them all a debt of gratitude. [Yet that does not give any one person the right to do harm to our country from a legislative position nor to put others in peril around the world by   policy.  Since I have been in Congress, Senator John McCain has pushed an agenda ranging from blanket amnesty for illegal aliens to support for President Barrack Obama’s and then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s disastrous Arab Spring endeavors that have made the United States much less safe as a result. Sen. McCain has been relentless in demanding amnesty for people illegally in this country long before Barrack Obama became president. He has refused to use his vast seniority and political power to safeguard the American people by securing the border, but has, instead, been the best friend   immigrants in this country could have. After President      Obama encouraged the ouster of United States ally and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in 2011, the radical Islamic group known internationally as the Muslim Brotherhood took over in Egypt, seeing to an election of one of their own, Mohamed Morsi.  While I was in Egypt, many people told me of the widespread atrocities, attacks on churches and massive suffering of Christians and Jews at the hands of the Muslim Brothers empowered by the Morsi presidency. Egypt’s Coptic Christian Pope Tawadros II told me it was the first time the Coptic Cathedral had been attacked in nearly 1, 000 years. Morsi was amassing power in disregard of the new Egyptian constitution and was on his way to becoming a dictator.  As the Egyptian protests continued to grow, the Muslim Brotherhood violence grew.  Then in June of 2013, a glorious thing happened. A protest began and grew into an estimated 33 million Egyptian Christians, Muslims and secularists. They went into the streets of Egypt in what has been described as the largest peaceful revolt in the history of the world. They demanded Morsi’s ouster, but this radical Egyptian president was undeterred.  Pope Tawadros II told me of two separate occasions of being moved to tears as moderate Muslim protesters against Morsi were in the streets apologizing to him for the widespread Christian persecution under the Morsi regime. Because the new Egyptian constitution, reportedly penned under advisement of the Obama administration, neglected to include an impeachment provision, the only way to get Morsi out of office was for enough people to demand the military remove him for treason.  The military finally removed him, and Morsi was jailed for an assortment of crimes. The Muslim Brotherhood was outraged and began a new wave of havoc and church burnings while demanding Morsi’s reinstatement.  Reportedly more than 70 churches and monasteries were set ablaze by Muslim Brotherhood supporters. Sen. McCain flew to Egypt in August of 2013 to stand with the Obama administration and the Muslim Brotherhood in demanding Morsi’s reinstatement as their corrupt, radical Islamist President. Fortunately, McCain’s wrongheaded efforts were not heeded by the Egyptian people because they did not want the radical Muslim Brother as a President. A new Constitution was written followed by the election of a new President of Egypt, Abdel Fattah   the military leader who heeded the demand of the largest peaceful uprising in the history of the world and removed the treasonous president.  Pope Tawadros II has since told me that President Sisi and the Egyptian army are actively helping to rebuild the churches. Some leaders in Israel have privately conveyed to me that this new Egyptian leader, whose removal McCain and Obama demanded, has done more to combat radical Islamic violence and terrorism than most any Egyptian leader in Israel’s modern history. Sen. McCain at one time showed support for dictator Muammar Qaddafi. While visiting Qaddafi in Libya in August of 2009, this tweet was sent from McCain’s official Senate office Twitter account: “@SenJohnMcCain: Late evening with Col. Qaddafi at his ‘ranch’ in Libya  —   interesting meeting with an interesting man. ”  He later sided with President Obama supporting Qaddafi’s removal, and even providing bombing support to rebels we knew contained al Qaeda. He did not seem to care, but continued his demand for siding with the Libyan rebels who have now helped create widespread chaos into surrounding countries. Indicating a further lack of judgment, one of Sen. McCain’s friends was former Libyan   leader Abdelhakim Belhadj, who the CIA had captured in 2004 and renditioned back to Libya. Ousting Qaddafi led to massive, widespread unrest in the entire region, yet Sen. McCain also insisted that President Obama remove Syrian President Bashar  . Had President Obama listened to McCain then, not only would Islamic radicals have taken over in Syria the way they initially did in Egypt, but innumerably more Syrians would be dead beyond the current 400, 000 body count. That would include those killed by Sen. McCain’s Syrian rebel friends who have been accused by international human rights groups of a number of human rights violations and war crimes. On the domestic front, McCain recently used a very heavy hand to push into the Defense Department bill a measure that forces women to register for the Selective Service so that women will be involuntarily drafted and sent to combat in times of war.  Senator McCain’s hair trigger temper became well known as he even was reported to have blown up, even using the   in his verbal assault in the face of another Republican Senator. We are indeed fortunate that Senator McCain is not regarded strongly enough that he has gotten his way with amnesty for those who have come illegally, women being drafted, the Muslim Brotherhood having more power, and groups who persecute Christians and Jews being empowered worldwide, to list only some of his misguided judgement. While acknowledging the sympathy he is due for his suffering in Viet Nam, I hope the voters of Arizona will rise up and stop John McCain from continuing to promote policies that are dangerous to the future of America and her allies. On August 30th, the prescription that has the best chance of curtailing suffering at home and abroad from the McCain wrongheaded, misguided,   judgment is to vote for Dr. Kelli Ward to be the Republican nominee for U. S. Senate. People of the world and the politically   citizens of the U. S. are praying that the people of Arizona will say, “enough is enough please come home, John McCain, take a rest, let Arizona, the nation and world recover. ” Congressman Gohmert is the Chairman of the Natural Resources Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations and the Vice Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security.

Boeing Suits Up for Future of Spaceflight with New Spacesuit Design - Breitbart,"In preparation for the scheduled 2018 launch of their Starliner spacecraft, Boeing has unveiled an innovative redesign of the traditional astronaut’s space suit.[  In the service of crawling out from beneath Russia’s current monopoly on spaceflight, NASA contractors Boeing and SpaceX continue to push toward the completion of   American craft. And while both are working hard on their respective rocket designs, Boeing was eager to demonstrate another vital element of the mission: The next generation of space suit. The “Boeing Blue” suit is leaner, lighter, more mobile, and sports quality of life improvements across the board. Crew and Mission Systems Director Chris Ferguson explained, “Astronauts had formerly had these relatively bulky, heavy suits with thick neck rings. And we learned throughout the years that maybe we didn’t need that. ” The new suit has been “simplified,” replacing the sealed   with a heavy   zipper, and adding breathable mesh beneath the surface to maximize comfort, mobility, and airflow. They are offering “pressurized mobility, while still preserving unpressurized comfort. ” Its gloves have been enhanced with special material on the palms and two of the fingers to allow for “capacitative” touch screen interaction. That means that astronauts can now interact with their capsule’s advanced touch interfaces, without leaving the protection of the suit. It’s also much lighter. While current space suits come in at a hefty 33 lbs, the Boeing design is barely 12. Ferguson claims that you can lie in the cockpit without any real need for external cooling, and it is comfortable enough to stand around in without developing an uncomfortable “heat load. ” The boots are “breathable and slip resistant,” and zippers on the torso have been designed to make it easier for a suited individual to “comfortably transition between sitting and standing. ” And, of course, the head provides     communications built right in, and significant improvements to peripheral vision. Despite the current  —   and somewhat convoluted  —   challenge of getting our intrepid men and women into space right now, we’re finally getting on track for a return to the forefront of   tech.

My Canada - The New York Times,"Canada, our No. 1 pick for this year’s 52 Places to Go list, spans millions of square miles. It also contains multitudes, not just of people and locations, but of memories. We asked five Canadian authors to reflect on places that have lodged in their psyches. My mother always kept a bright yellow hard hat in her car, an unexpected accessory for a petite Hong Kong immigrant in her  . She was the senior purchaser for a British Columbia forestry company that, in lean years, laid off everyone in her department except her. (More’s the pity she dreamed of early retirement.) In the meantime, she shuttled between the province’s pulp and paper mills, doing the job of six people, negotiating contracts for hotels, log loaders, harvesters and more. One year, when I was 25, I finally said yes to her persistent invitations to tag along. She wanted me to meet the men and women who earned their living in the mill towns, and who called her by her English name, Matilda. We set out in her car, exploring the    of Vancouver Island, heading for the northern tip, Port Hardy. This would turn out to be the last trip we took together. I remember the wet October chill eagles descending over corridors of evergreens a seemingly endless highway. At twilight, the world took on the shifting depths of an Emily Carr painting. I had to put up with my mother’s terrible driving, and her devotion to Celine Dion. She had to put up with my moods. I was going through a breakup and had decided that, in order to strengthen my moral fiber, I should camp, alone, for three days in the woods. I instructed my mother to drop me off at my campsite, work for a few days in Port Hardy, and then pick me up again. Port Hardy is a microcosm of Canada: a   town with a complex human and environmental history. The archaeological site of the island’s oldest known human habitation (circa 5850 B. C.) the area is the place of origin for the Kwakiutl peoples. The land of the Kwakiutl, whose name translates to “smoke of the world,” was taken into ownership  —   both private and national  —   by gunpoint, dishonored treaties and restrictive and discriminatory laws. The scramble for artifacts and the theft of Kwakiutl art  —   work that was celebrated by Claude   as among the most sophisticated in the world  —   has meant that much of the community’s historical work is housed in museums elsewhere. After 1849, the Kwakiutl population was decimated, but it survives. In 2013, British Columbia was found to have once again breached the Kwakiutl’s 1851 Treaty rights. This is not a history I learned in school. Alone in the woods, I pitched my tent. The dark fell suddenly. I made it five hours before calling my mom, telling her I was afraid, and asking her to come get me. That night, we shared a bed in a small lodging provided by her company. I smelled of the fire I had briefly managed to start. It felt good to lie beside my mother in a place that was complex and old. A little over a year later, my mother died suddenly in a town where she was working, much like this one, on a November night when her heart gave out. It was her   two kind forestry men who, worried about my mother, entered her hotel room in the morning, to find her gone. So peaceful, they told us, as if she were only sleeping. Fourteen years later, I understand better how the smoke of the world is never still. Many of the mills my mother visited have closed, jobs have been lost, and, as of a decade ago, a staggering 75 percent of Vancouver Island’s productive   forest has been logged. It is a place that will tell us much about the balance between jobs and environmental stewardship, about our respect for First Nations treaty rights and our obligations to the land. This is the Canada still to come. Madeleine Thien is the author of “Do Not Say We Have Nothing. ” Grindstone Island is a   dot of green leaves and Victorian gingerbread structures in the middle of Big Rideau Lake, halfway between Kingston and Ottawa.   in the 19th century to make way for its eponymous grindstone quarry, the island later became the summer home of Charles Kingsmill, the first admiral of the Royal Canadian Navy, and served as a genteel hub for Ottawa society life. Kingsmill’s daughter, Diana, who had a lifelong association with pacifist Quakers, took over Grindstone and turned it into a nonviolent resistance education center, staging legendary   games that recreated the infamous Stanford Prison Experiment as a way to train the “prisoners” to fight oppression with noncooperation  —   a practice that ended after a disastrous fake “invasion” by a local biker gang retained for the purpose. I came to Grindstone as a young teenager in the   attending the annual summer camps run by the nonprofit cooperative the Quakers put together to manage the island. The camps’ explicit mission was to train a new generation of activists, another step on the ladder that they had climbed, through trade unionism, farmers’ unions, suffragism and feminism, to antiwar activism. Grindstone was full of kids like me:   babies who attended alternative public schools in Toronto, Kingston and Ottawa, who could rhyme the classic protest chant “   ” with the facility of lifelong practice. Today it sounds hopelessly idealistic. But in the ’80s, Grindstone was a perfect incubator for young activists. With its quiet paths, crisp lake swimming and isolated spots with names like Moonwatcher’s Point, the Grindstone experience was one part lazing around and chatting, one part intense, practical instruction. The Victorian cottages we slept in had once housed the political elites of Ottawa society and their celebrity friends. Now they were ours. I’ve always been an early riser, and it was on Grindstone that I became addicted to sunrises, swimming around the island to catch them on the still lake amid the loon calls, then rushing in a shiver back to my cabin to change for breakfast and morning meeting on the broad, shaded porch of the main lodge. As I graduated out of the summer camps, I became active in the maintenance and management of the island, volunteering in the kitchens and serving on the  ’s board. When the  ’s finances crashed with the   recession, we sold the island to a dentist from Kingston who planned to commute by small pontoon plane. I was devastated. Today, Grindstone is the private home of David Bearman and Jennifer Trant  —   museum technology pioneers who fell in love with the island the first time they saw it, immediately dissolved their successful consultancy and took up residence there, running small conferences for people interested in museums and the web. Five years ago my family and I were their guests. The island felt haunted by the ghosts of the friends I’d made there and the dreams we’d shared. It has been 25 years since I left Grindstone on its final weekend as a social justice education center, and not a week goes by without my yearning for it with a kind of joy and sorrow that is sunk very deep in my heart. I visit it in my dreams, and in the photo feeds from its current owners when I see them at museum conferences, I demand to know all the minutiae of the island’s upkeep, which trees survived the winter storms and what color they’re painting the porch this year. I live in Burbank, Calif. now, and I take my    daughter on hikes in the nearby mountains. Sometimes, when we sit on a trailside boulder and listen to the winds soughing in the trees, I can almost pretend that I’ve brought her back to Grindstone, the place I had always assumed I would raise my own family. Cory Doctorow is the author of the forthcoming novel “Walkaway” and a special adviser to the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The Hawker Siddeley HS 748 is a delightful,   turboprop relic of an airplane, with metal everywhere you expect plastic, made to land on gravel or ice. Nestled in a Hawker, I flew north from Whitehorse, Yukon’s capital city, past 300 miles of moonscape  —   gray craters scarred by the white lines of mining roads that seemed to loop and go nowhere  —   before Dawson City appeared through a hole in the cloud cover. The subarctic town, nicknamed “Paris of the North” during the late   Gold Rush, looked like a strange, solitary incursion on the land. I was there to spend three months living in the childhood home of the Canadian writer Pierre Berton, who had donated the house for this purpose. A volunteer picked me up at the   airport. On the drive through town, we passed a truck with an animal carcass in the bed, antlers poking out past a tarp.   black birds pecked at the exposed edges. “If you leave your moose out, the ravens will get at it,” the volunteer said. The Yukon River divided the town into Dawson proper and West Dawson, a scattered community of   cabins whose inhabitants hauled their own wood, water and propane. I walked down to the river almost every day. It was October, and the black, bottomless water flowed fast toward Alaska. Over the next few weeks, the river changed. First the water took on the faint sheen of an oil slick. Then slivers of ice began to race along the current, catching the light like the heads and bellies of surfacing seals. Then bigger,   chunks of ice formed, audibly colliding and jostling for space until they clustered and   at a bottleneck bend. Finally, one morning in November, I woke to an eerie, noticeable silence. I went down to the river’s beach sheets of ice overlapped where they’d heaved onto the shore, their exposed   resembling massive blocks of turquoise glass. A government employee had drilled into the ice and laid out orange flags indicating where the ice was thick enough to walk safely. I watched a dogsled cross. Because of the snow cover, it wasn’t immediately clear where the ground ended and the river began. As I stepped out, I could hear ice continuing to crack, the sound of trickling water running in open rivulets. Under my feet, I’d been told, ran water deep enough to swallow a truck. This would be a stupid way to die, I thought. Halfway across, I stopped and looked south, toward where the Yukon River met the Klondike River. At this time of year, the sun rose so late and set so early that it circled the horizon in a continuous blaze of orange. Part of the Canadian identity is that we’re a hardy people, thriving in the inhospitable north. It’s one of those myths so ingrained and pervasive that you believe it even if, like me  —   like most  —   you have lived your whole life in cities less than 60 miles north of the American border. For just a moment, my breath clouding around me, icicles forming on my chin, I stood in that mythical Canada. I crossed and hiked triumphantly around West Dawson, which had been inaccessible except by helicopter during the  . The temperature dropped below   degrees Celsius. When I returned to the house, hours later, I peeled off my jeans and saw that my thighs, like my cheeks and nose, were a raw, violent red. Out on the river, I had seen two other people crossing. The first glided past on   skis with a baby strapped to his chest. The second was an acquaintance pulling a sled. “Just picking up my mail!” he called. Kim Fu is the author of the novel “For Today I Am a Boy” and the poetry collection “How Festive the Ambulance. ”  Hans Johann was a capitalist pig farmer, a man who owned the pigs and the farm. His wife was Barbara. They were both German Mennonites. After World War II, both had fled with their families from what was once Prussia to Niagara, which is where, on some acres between the lake and the waterfalls, they stayed and became Mama and Papa, then Oma and Opa. My mother, Linda, was the fourth of Oma and Opa’s seven children, born and christened at such a rate that the family could not afford middle names. Mama made up for this by calling me “Sarah Nicole,” while my father, one of four from the suburbs, has never said anything but “Sarah. ” At home in London, Ontario, I sided with my dad, thinking two names were less smart than one but when we went to the pig farm, my name was turned by thick German tongues into “   . ” This older, extrinsic version of me was the one I liked best. Summers belonged to Niagara. Driving to the farm in a station wagon with no empty seats, we knew we were close when the asphalt turned to dirt and had arrived when the dirt turned to gravel. A long lane,   in birches, led to an ancient Mercedes or two and a big John Deere tractor, a nameless cat curled under the exhaust pipe. In the kitchen, we ate Oma’s bread with havarti cheese and   summer grapes, on which a skim of dust belied a   of gold. What did we need money for? Nothing. Ice cream, maybe, if we wanted it in a cone from Avondale Dairy. Turtles swam with us in the pool, the water cold and unchlorinated under scum, colored the dim vegetative green of fairy tales before they’re Americanized. Oma said her ferns would grow better if we urinated in the soil, and we rolled our eyes but did it, one at a time. I sneaked away to the gully, read my aunt’s ahistorical romance novels. My brother shot a dove with a BB gun. Pigs screamed in the barn. It seemed in those summers impossible that the sun could either burn me or fail to wake me up, that I could ever be sick for more than three days or have an allergy. I was no more friends with nature than I was friends with my kin, yet it seemed that nature and I felt the same way: indifferent to the rules, remote no matter how we were tamed. My grandfather is alive, freshly widowed. Though he no longer capitalizes on much or practices animal husbandry, he lives in the bungalow on the farm and makes and sells peach and grape jam. Everyone thinks they know what peach and grape jam taste like, but I maintain that Opa’s jam can make you forget what a fruit is. Sarah Nicole Prickett is a writer in New York and the founder of Adult Magazine.  A few years ago, I got to pick a small village to stay in for a while and write poetry. I chose the Missisquoi Valley, in the Eastern Townships of Quebec, because I liked what the bay’s First Nations name meant: many aquatic birds. Indeed, I saw birds everywhere: in my dreams, above my head, through the windows. I saw the wind, too, moving across the cornfields. The region also brought me back to my love of New England. When choosing the town I was to stay in, I’d randomly pointed at a little village called Mystic. It was an enticing name. I’d also found a sister city in the United States with the same name, which had a museum with a room dedicated to Herman Melville. When I write, I always let myself be led by coincidence. I quickly started inventing connections between Melville and the Québécois Mystic between me scribbling notes in a rented Cavalier and the trailblazers of real and fictional territory that were the great American writers of the 19th century. I also imagined stories of the devil whirling around in the town’s   barn, and created my own private numerology. I would look for covered bridges on the road, round barns built by utopian Quakers and Victorian houses. I thought about loyalists fleeing north after the Revolutionary War, about Irish Catholics fleeing famine, about all the immigrants who left their mark along the path. I knew that by venturing further, to the shores of the great Lake Memphremagog, I would also think about the Vietnam War deserters who’d found refuge there. I thought about the First Nation Abenakis, how they named the lakes and rivers, and about our ignorance. I began my stay at Pike River, but I understood that this road was one where each stop would lead to another. I walked into the office of tourism in Stanbridge Station, my next stop, and asked a petite historian a thousand questions. She showed me Chemin St.  on the map, which she called the second prettiest road in Quebec. (I never learned where the first was.) I didn’t stay in Mystic. As soon as I caught sight of the old cemetery in Hunter Mills, I became fascinated by the border zone between Quebec and the United States. It represented the state I was in myself: a wandering state of mind, looking for ghosts, mine and others’ looking for my words, my promised land, my house built stone by stone throughout my life. And that is how, having been asked to stay in a small village, I found myself gathering the rosary beads of hamlets strung along the border area. I’m still enamored with the scenery I found there: isolated villages in the shadow of the mountains, whose grandeur lorded over long lakes and rivers farms and cornfields a Mercedes up on four blocks amid the junk strewn in front of an abandoned house old   cemeteries that pop up at every turn leafy trees of maple, walnut, beech, oak, birch a few wayside crosses old churches and train stations and checkpoints and in the morning, at the inn by the river, a little black cat sitting on a tree branch listening to the sound of the falls and the purring coffeepot.

En français: Il y a quelques années, on m’a demandé de séjourner dans un petit village de mon choix afin d’y écrire des poèmes. J’ai choisi la vallée de la Missisquoi dans les cantons de l’est en Québec, parce que j’aimais la signification du nom donné par les Premières Nations à la baie: beaucoup d’oiseaux aquatiques. Déjà, je voyais des oiseaux partout, dans mes rêves, autour de ma tête, derrière les fenêtres. Je voyais aussi le vent bouger à travers les champs de maïs. Cette région me ramenait aussi à mon amour de la  . Afin de choisir le village de mon séjour, j’avais pointé mon doigt sur un petit village appelé Mystic. Ce nom m’attirait. J’avais aussi découvert une ville homonyme aux   où il y avait, dans un musée, une salle dédiée à Melville. Je me laisse toujours guider par les coïncidences pour écrire. J’inventais d’ores et déjà des liens entre Melville et le Mystic québécois entre moi prenant des notes dans une Cavalier louée, et ces défricheurs de territoires réels et fictifs que sont les grands écrivains américains du 19e siècle. J’imaginais aussi des histoires de diable tournant en rond dans la Grange à douze côtés, et créais une numérologie intime à moi. Je chercherais les ponts couverts sur la route, les granges rondes construites par des quakers utopiques, les maisons à façade victorienne je pensais à la fuite des loyalistes vers le nord, aux Irlandais catholiques fuyant la famine, à tous ces immigrants ayant laissé leurs traces sur le chemin. Je savais qu’en m’aventurant plus loin, aux abords du grand lac Memphrémagog, je penserais aussi aux déserteurs de la guerre du Vietnam. Je pensais aux Abénaquis des Premières Nations, qui ont donné les noms aux lacs et aux rivières, à notre ignorance. À   là où mon séjour commençait, j’ai compris cependant que j’étais sur une route où chaque arrêt menait à un autre. Je suis entrée dans le bureau du tourisme, j’ai posé mille questions à une petite historienne de Stanbridge Station. Elle m’a indiqué sur la carte où se trouve Chemin   la deuxième plus belle route du Québec. (Je n’ai pas jamais appris où se situe la première). Et je ne suis pas restée à Mystic: dès que j’ai aperçu le vieux cimetière de Hunter Mills, c’est la zone frontalière entre le Québec et les   qui m’a fascinée. Elle était l’illustration de l’état dans lequel je me trouvais, dans l’esprit de l’errance, à la recherche de fantômes, les miens, ceux des autres à la recherche de mes mots, ma terre promise, ma maison construite pierre après pierre tout au long de ma vie. Et c’est ainsi qu’appelée à séjourner dans un petit village, je me suis retrouvée à ramasser les grains d’un chapelet de hameaux dispersés sur le chemin de la frontière. Le décor que j’y ai trouvé m’enchante toujours: villages enclavés dans l’ombre des montagnes, dont le grandeur veillaient sur les lacs longs et les rivières fermes et champs de maïs une Mercedes sur quatre blocs à travers le débarras devant une maison à l’abandon de vieux cimetières   qui surprennent à chaque détour des arbres feuillus, érables, noyers, êtres, chênes, bouleaux quelques croix de chemin d’anciennes gares et églises, de vieux postes de frontière et le matin, à l’auberge, un petit chat noir perché sur une branche d’arbre écoutant le bruit des chutes et de la cafetière qui ronronne."
Hillary Clinton Next to Cardinal Dolan at Al Smith Dinner One Day After Defending Partial Birth Abortion - Breitbart,"Just one day after defending   partial birth abortion in the third presidential debate, Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton was seated next to New York archbishop Cardinal Timothy Dolan at the annual Al Smith Dinner charity fundraiser. [The sanctity of all human life is a primary doctrine of the Catholic Church.  “I will defend Planned Parenthood,” Clinton said in Las Vegas during the final presidential debate. “I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women’s rights to make their own healthcare decisions,” she added, continuing the   narrative that abortion is healthcare. WikiLeaks recently revealed emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta showing the campaign denigrating the Catholic faith. Dolan said Monday at the “Respect Life Dinner” that he found the Clinton campaign’s treatment of Catholics, as revealed in the leaked emails, “extraordinarily patronizing and insulting. ” “[I]f it had been said about the Jewish community, the Islamic community, within 10 minutes there would have been an apology and a complete distancing from those remarks, which hasn’t happened yet,” Dolan said, reports ABC’s News Channel 13. “I’m hoping that she’s going to distance herself from these remarks by her chief of staff. ” Maureen Ferguson, senior policy advisor with The Catholic Association, noted in a statement Friday, “Prior to last night’s Al Smith Dinner, a fundraiser for Catholic Charities, Cardinal Dolan asked for an apology from Hillary Clinton for the   sentiments expressed by her campaign leadership in leaked emails. ” “Even more disturbing than the disparaging remarks in the emails are Hillary Clinton’s own statements that ‘religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed’ to line up with her abortion agenda,” Ferguson added. “Her plan is to use the force of the federal government to deprive groups like Catholic Charities of their right to serve the poor according to their faith. ” During the debate Wednesday evening, Clinton complained about states that have restricted abortion to five months into pregnancy and those that have attempted to secure the health of women seeking abortion by requiring abortion clinics to maintain the same types of health and safety standards as other outpatient surgical facilities. While campaigning, Clinton has compared   Americans to terrorists. “Extreme views about women, we expect that from some of the terrorist groups, we expect that from people who don’t want to live in the modern world, but it’s a little hard to take coming from Republicans who want to be the president of the United States,” she said. “Yet, they espouse out of date and out of touch policies. They are dead wrong for 21st century America. We are going forward, we are not going back. ”"

"Insider Trading Case Links Golfer, Banker and Gambler - The New York Times","Phil Mickelson has five major golf championships and countless endorsement deals. Thomas C. Davis, a former investment banker, has a Harvard pedigree and a country club lifestyle. They also had a secret. Both men owed money to William T. Walters, a   Las Vegas kingmaker, often considered the most successful sports bettor in the country. Now, federal authorities say those debts were at the center of a   insider trading scheme. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan on Thursday unveiled criminal charges against Mr. Walters, saying that illegal stock tips from Mr. Davis helped him generate some $40 million in profits and avoided losses. They also charged Mr. Davis, who has agreed to plead guilty and who is cooperating against Mr. Walters. Mr. Mickelson was not accused of wrongdoing. But the Securities and Exchange Commission listed him in a civil complaint as a relief defendant, arguing that he was “unjustly enriched” and must disgorge “  gains” he made from trades Mr. Walters recommended. Mr. Mickelson, known as “Lefty,” agreed to repay nearly $1 million, and his lawyer said he “takes full responsibility for the decisions and associations that led him to becoming part of this investigation. ” The investigation hinged on Mr. Davis’s mounting debts, which were far larger than Mr. Mickelson’s and which may have provided a motive to share inside information. Mr. Davis retired from investment banking at Credit Suisse First Boston in 2001, the government said, but not from the   lifestyle it enabled. His finances were so troubled, the authorities said, that he even misused money from a charity. Mr. Walters also lent him money. Mr. Davis, then the chairman of Dean Foods, returned the favor by feeding Mr. Walters boardroom secrets as far back as 2008, the authorities say. To disguise the scheme, they said, the two men used disposable cellphones and created “a secret code” for discussing Dean Foods, a Dallas company, referring to it as “the Dallas Cowboys. ” “Davis breached his duty and broke the law as the result of being in dire financial straits,” Andrew J. Ceresney, the head of the S. E. C. ’s enforcement division, said at a news conference on Thursday. And Mr. Walters, who was arrested at a resort in Las Vegas late Wednesday, was “gambling on a sure thing. ” The case, however, is much broader than a story about gambling debts. The charges represent one of the most notable insider trading prosecutions since a federal appellate court overturned two prominent convictions  —   a ruling that led to the dismissal of about a dozen other convictions. After the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned the convictions of two hedge fund managers, Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson, in December 2014  —   and in the process imposed the greatest limits on prosecutors in a generation  —   the government predicted a chilling effect on future insider trading investigations. Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, who led a sweeping crackdown on insider trading, warned that the ruling could allow “a potential bonanza for friends and family of rich people. ” But in charging both Mr. Walters and Mr. Davis with securities fraud and wire fraud, his office and the S. E. C. are sending a message that these cases can still be made. “Brazen insider trading continues to be a blot in our securities markets, and so the integrity of our markets continues to be a priority for this office,” Mr. Bharara said at the news conference. Still, he added that “there is conduct that we think is nefarious and undermines faith in the market and undermines the strength of the market that will not be able to be prosecuted because of the Newman decision. ” Mr. Walters’s lawyer said his client had done nothing wrong. “Bill Walters is a true American success story, whose extraordinary accomplishments as a lawful sports gambler have been widely recognized and lauded,” the lawyer, Barry Berke, said in a statement. “Mr. Walters and his counsel look forward to his day in court. ” This is not the first time Mr. Walters, who is 69, has been the subject of a criminal investigation. He has faced charges four times, none of which resulted in a conviction. The latest investigation of Mr. Walters centered largely on trading in shares of Dean Foods, the nation’s largest milk processor, and its decision to spin off a subsidiary. The court filings detail the following: Days after learning of the planned spinoff in 2010, Mr. Davis flew to Las Vegas to meet with Mr. Walters. On the next business day, Mr. Walters purchased a million shares of Dean Foods. The deal was delayed. But two years later, while at his country club, Mr. Davis dialed into a Dean Foods conference call to discuss a renewed spinoff effort. Three minutes after the call ended, Mr. Davis rang Mr. Walters. Nine minutes after that, Mr. Walters called his stockbroker to buy more shares. Mr. Walters also called Mr. Mickelson and recommended that he buy shares in Dean Foods. At the time, Mr. Mickelson owed money to Mr. Walters on a gambling debt. The S. E. C. said some of the nearly $1 million in trading profit Mr. Mickelson made on shares of Dean Foods went to reimburse Mr. Walters. Mr. Mickelson, who has a reputation for betting on sports, may not have known the origins of the tip. But on at least two occasions, the F. B. I. contacted Mr. Mickelson to seek his cooperation in the case against Mr. Walters, people briefed on the investigation have previously said. Once, agents approached him on a golf course, another time at an airport hangar. At Thursday’s news conference in Lower Manhattan, the S. E. C. displayed a chart with the heading: “Mickelson’s Trades in Dean Foods. ” Gregory Craig, a lawyer for Mr. Mickelson, described the   winner of the Masters golf tournament as “an innocent bystander. ” “Phil understands and deeply respects the high professional and ethical standards that the companies he represents expect of their employees, associates and of Phil himself,” Mr. Craig said in a statement. “He subscribes to the same values and regrets any appearance that, on this occasion, he fell short. ” Through all the illicit trades that underpin the case against Mr. Walters, Mr. Davis was the common thread. In addition to the 2012 spinoff, Mr. Davis provided Mr. Walters with “sneak previews” of at least six quarterly earnings statements for Dean Foods, the S. E. C. said. Authorities say that Mr. Davis also tipped Mr. Walters to a    activist campaign by a group of hedge fund investors who were looking to shake things up at Darden, which owns restaurant chains including Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse. In the summer of 2013, Mr. Davis was approached by a representative of the group about its intention to acquire shares in Darden. Mr. Davis signed an agreement that he would keep the plans confidential but he told Mr. Walters nonetheless, authorities said. Mr. Davis also “misappropriated” $100, 000 from a charity he ran that raised money for a  ’s shelter in Dallas, according to the court filings. He took the money to pay down a gambling debt at a Las Vegas casino. The charges against Mr. Davis include perjury  —   authorities said he lied to the S. E. C. during a deposition last year  —   and obstruction of justice because he “corruptly altered” and destroyed evidence in May 2014 when news of the investigation first emerged. Mr. Davis resigned as chairman of Dean Foods last August. Thomas M. Melsheimer, a Dallas lawyer representing Mr. Davis, said his client was “pleased to be assisting the government in its investigation. ” The case against Mr. Walters comes as prosecutors reassess their ability to bring insider trading cases. The appeals court ruling constrained the pursuit of cases involving the sharing of inside information between friends. Specifically, the appeals court required “proof of a meaningfully close personal relationship that generates an exchange that is objective, consequential and represents at least a potential gain of a pecuniary or similarly valuable nature. ” The case against Mr. Walters addressed the issue of “pecuniary” gain  . The   indictment not only details Mr. Walter’s longtime friendship with Mr. Davis  —   they first met 20 years ago on a golf course  —   but that he had entered into numerous business deals and personal loans with him. They invested in a software company together. Mr. Walters arranged for a friend to provide Mr. Davis with a $625, 000 personal loan. And as Mr. Davis fell deeper into financial trouble, Mr. Walters helped bail him out with a $350, 000 loan that was never repaid. “It’s a straightforward announcement that the Southern District is still in the insider trading prosecution business,” said Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor, who is now a professor at Columbia Law School. “It’s also a reminder that however important Newman is, if the facts are there, you can take on the burden of proving precisely the kind of exchange that Newman demanded. ”"

Billionaire Tom Steyer Launches Ad Campaign Against Rex Tillerson - Breitbart,"Billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer is pushing an ad campaign targeting former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, Donald Trump’s pick for Secretary of State. [The ad, launched by Steyer’s NextGen Climate   group, claims that as CEO of ExxonMobil, Tillerson put his company’s interests first and did business with Russia.   But Steyer, a former hedge fund manager, has his own record of doing business with the Russians. In 2010, Steyer’s hedge fund Farallon Capital Management profited from a sale of its stake in a Russian oil firm to a investment firm owned by Russian billionaire Gennady Timchenko, according to the Free Beacon. Timchenko was later targeted by Treasury Department sanctions in 2014, due to his relationship with Vladimir Putin. Steyer, a committed supporter of environmental causes and Democrats, endorsed Hillary Clinton in June 2016, and hosted a fundraiser for her in 2015. “Tell your Senators to reject Rex Tillerson and protect American interests, not corporate interests,” the   ad concludes. Steyer spent more than $75 million in in the 2016 election, as his NextGen Climate action group spent millions to combat Trump with ads including this one: Trump’s transition team should expect environmental groups to unite against Tillerson’s nomination, due to his former position as head of ExxonMobil."
"Watch: Alex Marlow Talks Media, Free Speech, and Rhetoric with Bill Maher - Breitbart","On Friday’s “Real Time with Bill Maher” on HBO, host and comedian Bill Maher interviewed Breitbart News    Alex Marlow.  The two discussed Breitbart’s coverage, the media, Russia, free speech, the shooting at a congressional baseball practice, and political rhetoric. Marlow said that Breitbart is “not going to cover the exact same stories the exact same way as all the other outlets. We’ll leave that to the rest of the establishment press. We’re very much   trying to highlight stories that we don’t think get their fair day. ” After the discussion turned to Russia, Marlow stated that there was no evidence of collusion or obstruction of justice, adding, “You guys continue to talk about this story in the establishment press instead of talking about the president’s agenda, which is by design. Because you guys won’t apologize if it turns out there’s nothing, no one will come out on MSNBC, they’ll just move on to the next hysteria, and that’s a huge advantage for people like me who are covering the rest of the news. ” Marlow later said, “I love highlighting Muslim voices who are progressive and reformist and want to take out some of the misogyny and some of the hatred associated with radical elements of it. And I think that’s an important place to start, but to bring back what Breitbart does different than anyone else, is we cover stories the establishment press doesn’t want to cover. ” On free speech, Maher and Marlow agreed that if the depictions of the assassination of President Trump were of President Obama, the reaction on the left would be different. Maher then raised corporations pulling ads from people who engage in speech they do not like. Marlow said, “This really started —  in my view —  in the modern era, with Breitbart —  where a lot of people are boycotting Breitbart. And what they’re doing is, there’s a lot of anonymous people online, cowardly people. We don’t know who’s funding them. We don’t know who they are, who are putting out all of this misinformation about who we are and what we stand for, and they’re trying to round up corporations to boycott us. And so, what’s happened is that corporations are now deciding what’s free and fair speech, who can make a living, what opinions you can make a living saying now, and, of course, now, you’re seeing the right fight fire with fire and want boycotts of when the left takes it too far in their Trump hatred. So it’s a very dangerous path we’re on, and I really do think, Bill, and I appreciate you giving me this opportunity, people on the left and the right who are free speech advocates need to come together right now and say that corporations are not going to define the First Amendment and free speech in this country. ” Marlow said that he does not believe Bernie Sanders is at fault for the congressional baseball practice shooting and continued, “When you have a climate where you have, CNN, for example, calling Breitbart to the number one platform for the Nazi salute over a video we never played and CNN played, when you have the New York Times accusing Breitbart of putting racist dog whistles out, when the media lies so much about people, calling Trump supporters racists, despicable, deplorable, all of these things over and over  …    ” Maher cut in, “They have been racist, despicable, and deplorable. ” Marlow concluded, “I encourage everyone to go to breitbart. . You can meet some of the Breitbart reporters, the Breitbart editors. They’re the most wonderful, diverse, influential journalists on the planet, and no one is interested in their real story because they’re so quick to call people racist. And it’s not working. That is why so many Democrats are losing across the country.   …     And so, if you want to play that game, Bill, if you want to keep calling us racists, I don’t think it’s going to work for you, so please, have at it. ” Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo."
21 Stuck 130 Feet Up for 6 Hours at Knott’s Berry Farm - Breitbart,"  children and adults got the ride they never planned on Friday night when a Knott’s Berry Farm ride malfunctioned, trapping the riders for six hours before a rescue could be accomplished. [Sky Cabin is no roller coaster, it is a slow moving ride that rises high which gives those on board a   view of Buena Park. At its apex the ride reaches 180 feet,  Knott’s Berry Farm first released a statement just after 6 p. m that informed the public that the ride first malfunctioned around 2 p. m. The statement continued, “The Sky Cabin is a fully enclosed revolving observation ride. After the Knott’s Berry Farm maintenance team made several attempts to bring the attraction down, we contacted the Orange County Fire Authority to assist. ” Approximately 36 firefighters arrived near 5 p. m. according to the Los Angeles Times. An Orange County Fire Authority assured not one of the trapped riders was hurt or in danger and that firefighters are trained for just such situations. It was about 7:30 p. m. when fire crews began lowering riders the 130 feet from where the structure came to a halt. The riders were brought to the ground using a safety harness. “All 20 guests and one ride operator were safely on the ground by 9:54 pm,” read an update from the park that came at 10:06 p. m.. “Each of Knott’s rides is inspected,   and properly maintained daily. Sky Cabin will remain closed until the park’s investigation into the cause of the incident is completed. ” “Knott’s Berry Farm’s number one priority is the safety of all its guests and employees,” the park statement assured.

Spelman College ends professorship funded by Cosby,"Atlanta (CNN) Spelman College, a historically black women’s school in Atlanta, has officially terminated a professorship endowed by actor Bill Cosby and his wife Camille. While the university did not cite a reason, the move comes one week after CNN obtained a copy of a   deposition in which Cosby admitted he procured drugs to give to women he wanted to have sex with. Cosby, 78, has been publicly accused of sexual assault by over two dozen women. Many have claimed the actor gave them drugs without their knowledge. He has never been criminally charged and has vehemently denied wrongdoing. ”The William and Camille Olivia Hanks Cosby Endowed Professorship at Spelman College has been discontinued,” the school’s communications office said in a brief statement Saturday. It went on to say that ”related funds” have been returned to the Clara Elizabeth Jackson Carter Foundation and that is has no further comment. That organization was established by Cosby’s wife, Camille, and named for her mother. Spelman College has a long association with Cosby.  Two of Cosby’s daughters, Erika and Evin, attended the institution. His late son, Ennis, graduated from Morehouse College, a prominent men’s college connected with Spelman. ”A Different World,” the ”The Cosby Show” spinoff that ran from 1987 to 1993, took place at a fictitious black school based loosely on Spelman and other schools. Some of the show’s outdoor scenes were filmed there and producers visited the campus to speak with students about script ideas.   The  professorship was funded through an endowment created in the late 1980s, when Bill and Camille Cosby donated $20 million dollars to Spelman.  At the time, it was the largest individual donation ever made to an historically black college or university (HBCU). It was not clear Saturday evening how much of that endowment went toward the professorship. CNN was unable to reach representatives for the college or Cosby representatives. Spelman initially suspended the   professorship in December 2014, when allegations against Cosby of rape were growing. In a statement cited at the time by The Atlanta   a school spokeswoman said that the humanities professorship was established ”to bring positive attention and accomplished visiting scholars to Spelman College in order to enhance our intellectual, cultural and creative life.” The spokeswoman continued, ”The current context prevents us from continuing to meet these objectives fully. Consequently, we will suspend the program until such time that the original goals can again be met.” The deposition obtained by CNN earlier this month dates back to 2005 and 2006.  In it, Cosby was questioned under oath by the attorney for Andrea Constand, who had accused the actor of rape.  While Cosby admitted during questioning that he acquired Quaaludes with the intent to give the sedatives to young women he wanted to have sex with, he did not admit to actually drugging any of his accusers."
"Maher: Comparing Islamic Terror To Oklahoma City, ’A False Equivalency,’ Christian Groups Aren’t Trying To Get Nuclear Weapons - Breitbart","HBO’s “Real Time” host Bill Maher declared comparing Islamic terrorism to the Oklahoma City bombing is “a false equivalency. ” And stated, “I don’t think there are any Christian groups that trying to obtain a nuclear weapon” on Friday.  After saying that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s statement that President Obama seemed madder at him than the shooter, Maher stated that he wished there would be more focus on the terrorists first. He added, “Now, of course it’s wrong when any Muslim American is given a dirty look, asked extra questions, but it’s not the same as people getting shot. ” After former advisor to Colin Powell, Col. Lawrence Wilkerson (Ret.) brought up the Oklahoma City bombing, Maher responded, “Sir, that is a false equivalency. ” Later in the discussion, Business Insider Senior Editor Josh Barro said, “I think Americans are already alarmed enough about terrorism. It is a statistically really unlikely mode of death. People should be more worried about  …    whether they eat too much. ” Maher cut in, “Except, they are trying to get a nuclear weapon and I don’t think there are any Christian groups that trying to obtain a nuclear weapon, sir. ” He further stated, “No one is saying that the only bad things happen in the Muslim world, we are saying, I am saying, lots of people  …    that there  —   you have to go where the preponderance of it is. And there is no doubt that it  —   that most of it happens in this sphere. ” Maher later argued, “Hillary Clinton said this week,   Muslims. Well, this is what Bush  —   this was his mistake, to think, all people in the world want to be just like us. I don’t know if freedom, as we think of it, is the same way they think of it. ” After actor Ravi Patel brought up Muslims in the US, Maher responded, “In America, that’s three million out of 1. 6 billion. Exactly. In America. ” Maher further argued that Muslims should be free from his prior description of the way Muslims think of freedom, “but shouldn’t the other ones be included in it. Shouldn’t the liberals in this country stand with all those people who have to face what I call everyday terrorism?” Wilkerson then brought up Indonesia, to which Maher stated, “You know what? In Indonesia, if a woman wants to join the military she has to undergo what they call the   test. [Maher then held up two fingers] They put that in her   …     They want to see if she’s a virgin, and this is the moderate country that they hold up as an example. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"
US investigators corroborate some aspects of the Russia dossier,"Washington (CNN) For the first time, US investigators say they have corroborated some of the communications detailed in a   dossier compiled by a former British intelligence agent, multiple current and former US law enforcement and intelligence officials tell CNN. As CNN first reported,    Donald Trump and President Barack Obama were briefed on the existence of the dossier prior to Trump’s inauguration.  None of the newly learned information relates to the salacious allegations in the dossier. Rather it relates to conversations between foreign nationals. The dossier details about a dozen conversations between senior Russian officials and other Russian individuals. Sources would not confirm which specific conversations were intercepted or the content of those discussions due to the classified nature of US intelligence collection programs. But the intercepts do confirm that some of the conversations described in the dossier took place between the same individuals on the same days and from the same locations as detailed in the dossier, according to the officials. CNN has not confirmed whether any content relates to   Trump.  The corroboration, based on intercepted communications, has given US intelligence and law enforcement ”greater confidence” in the credibility of some aspects of the dossier as they continue to actively investigate its contents, these sources say.  Reached for comment this afternoon, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said,  ”We continue to be disgusted by CNN’s fake news reporting.”  Spicer later called back and said, ”This is more fake news.  It is about time CNN focused on the success the President has had bringing back jobs, protecting the nation, and strengthening relationships with Japan and other nations.  The President won the election because of his vision and message for the nation.” Spokespeople for the FBI, Department of Justice, CIA and Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment. US intelligence officials emphasize the conversations were solely between foreign nationals, including those in or tied to the Russian government, intercepted during routine intelligence gathering. Some of the individuals involved in the intercepted communications were known to the US intelligence community as ”heavily involved” in collecting information damaging to Hillary Clinton and helpful to Donald Trump, two of the officials tell CNN.   Until now, US intelligence and law enforcement officials have said they could not verify any parts of the dossier.  Officials who spoke to CNN cautioned they still have not reached any judgment on whether the Russian government has any compromising information about the President.    Officials did not comment on or confirm any alleged conversations or meetings between Russian officials and US citizens, including associates of   Trump. One of the officials stressed to CNN they have not corroborated ”the more salacious things” alleged in the dossier. CNN has not reported any of the salacious allegations. Trump dismissed the entire dossier last month during his only news conference as   saying in January, ”It’s all fake news. It’s phony stuff. It didn’t happen.” The dossier was commissioned as opposition research by political opponents of   Trump and compiled by a former British intelligence agent. US intelligence agencies checked out the former MI6 operative and his vast network throughout Europe and found him and his sources to be credible."
Kellogg Foundation Supports Group Headed by Cop-Killer-Loving Black Lives Matter Founder,"The Kellogg Company’s namesake nonprofit, the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, has given over half a million dollars to the community organizing group Black Alliance for Just Immigration (BAJI) a   borders group headed by Opal Tometi, one of the three   of the Black Lives Matter movement. [Tometi is currently the Executive Director of BAJI, but has previously served as both   and Communications Director of the organization, which was formed in 2006 and describes itself as “an education and advocacy group comprised of African Americans and black immigrants from Africa, Latin American and the Caribbean. ”  In a recent video responding to the election of Donald Trump, Tometi urges a coalition of “black, brown, native, Muslim, immigrant, LGBTQ, folks with [criminal] records, folks with disabilities, and poor communities” to fight “violence” and “fascism” during the Trump administration. She states that they “must perfect the art of organizing people,” and that “if you’re white, your work is to organize other people to donate and challenge white supremacy, and if you find yourself in melanin spaces, learn to take direction from us. ” Black Lives Matter was   by three women: Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi. Two of them —  Garza and Tometi —  are and have been employed by immigration reform groups. Tometi, as mentioned earlier, is the Executive Director of BAJI, and Garza has served as the Executive Director of POWER, which later merged with the noted   immigration group Causa Justa :: Just Cause. The W. K. Kellogg Foundation recently gave BAJI $450, 000 in what appears to be a general grant to help fund the group from November 2016 until 2019. The grant’s stated purpose is to: Strengthen and align the movement for racial justice and immigrant rights by supporting the leadership skills and advocacy opportunities of Black immigrants and refugees, An earlier grant from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation gave BAJI $75, 000 to: Deepen the understanding of immigrants of African descent and of national immigration policies and practices by providing educational resources, technical assistance, civic leadership training and communication workshops, Since the Kellogg Company has said that they were pulling advertising from Breitbart News because Breitbart doesn’t match their “values,” it’s worth looking at the values the company, through its namesake nonprofit arm the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, is supporting with the $525, 000 donation to BAJI. BAJI Executive Director Opal Tometi is an admirer of convicted cop killer and terrorist Assata Shakur. In the video below, Tometi is seen with Black Lives Matter   Patrisse Cullors leading a group of women in “Assata’s Prayer,” a chant that is common at leftist rallies and that Cullors says is used at every Black Lives Matter event, action, and  .  The above video is from the keynote event at a BlogHer conference in New York City, where Essence magazine    Vanessa De Luca interviewed Cullors and Tometi, who described their respect for the convicted criminal communist Shakur. In the video, Cullors tells the crowd: So this is how we close out every meeting, every event, every action, every freeway we’ve shut down, every mall we’ve shut down, you’ll hear this chant reverberated throughout this country. And you’ll hear it in other countries, now, too. This is from our beloved Assata Shakur, who is on the number one FBI   list, and she’s a powerful leader who we are inspired by. Many of us have “Assata Taught Me” sweaters. So it’s three times, and we’re going to start off with a whisper, and you’re going to just repeat it: It is our duty to fight for freedom. It is our duty to win. We must love and support one another. We have nothing to lose but our chains. The lines come from a letter that Shakur wrote titled “To My People,” where she describes herself as a “Black revolutionary” who “declared war on the rich who prosper on our poverty, the politicians who lie to us with smiling faces, and all the mindless,   robots who protect them and their property. ” Shakur is a hero to communist revolutionaries for her involvement in the 1960s and 1970s with a violent, criminal Black Panther Party offshoot called the Black Liberation Army. Shakur and the group robbed several banks as a “revolutionary act” and eventually killed a New Jersey State Trooper with his own gun after a highway stop in 1973. After her conviction, Shakur escaped prison when other Black Liberation Army members visiting her pulled a gun and took guards hostage. Shakur lived on the lam for several years, as her associates refused to cooperate with authorities, until fleeing to Cuba in 1984. Shakur has also been lionized by ’60s radicals like the Weather Underground’s Kathy Boudin, who had named her son Chesa after Shakur’s real name, JoAnne Chesimard. BAJI has also employed another high profile Black Lives Matter activist named Tia Oso, who put herself in the national spotlight when she took to the stage at the 2015 Netroots Nation conference and helped shut down appearances by two Democrats running for President, former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Her biography does not mention that Ms. Oso is a convicted felon who took money from another community group she worked with. As the Phoenix New Times reported : While working as the business manager for the Arizona Citizens for the   Action for the Arts in 2007 and 2008, a job she includes in her online résumé, Oso issued checks to herself, made unauthorized withdrawals and made personal charges on the organization’s credit card. The theft occurred over the course of a year and totalled about $11, 000, court records show. Oso had walked off the job in May 2008 without explanation “after being counseled about absences and   issues,” records state. She was fired after she failed to show up for work for three days, and the embezzlement was apparently discovered soon afterward.   at the time, Oso confessed to court officials that she used the money to pay rent, make car payments, and “stabilize her financial situation. ” She pleaded guilty to one count of felony theft. BAJI has also received funding from major leftist billionaire donor George Soros. "
"Prez More Popular than Congress: Trump 40%, Ryan 39%, Pelosi 34%, Schumer 31%, McConnell 27%","Despite continuous stories in the media reporting that President Donald Trump has the lowest favorable rating in his first 100 days of any president in modern history, Congress’s approval is worse. [A new Gallup poll shows Trump’s favorable rating stands at 40 percent, one percentage point above 39 percent for House Speaker Paul Ryan ( ).  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s favorable rating is eight percentage points lower than Ryan’s at 31 percent. But the honor for having the lowest rating goes to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( ) which stands at 27 percent. “As the possibility of a government shutdown looms, fewer than one in three Americans view either party’s U. S. Senate leader favorably,” Gallup reported on Wednesday. “Although both men have been prominent figures in Congress for decades, roughly a third of Americans don’t know either well enough to have an opinion. ” The Gallup data, collected in an April   poll, marks the first time Gallup has measured Schumer’s popularity and notes that his 31 percent matches the same number for McConnell when he was first rated in 2010. “McConnell’s image has been consistently less positive than that in polls since then, with his favorable rating ranging mostly in the 20s  —   and his 18% favorable in 2015 marking a low for the majority leader. Since 2013, Americans have consistently been more likely to have an unfavorable view of McConnell,” Gallup reported. Gallup reports that Ryan’s’s popularity has declined by almost 10 percentage points since the failure of the American Health Care Act  —   from 48 percent in November 2016 to 39 percent in April. “Ryan is not alone in low ratings among House leadership,” Gallup reported. “Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, currently has a 34% favorable rating and a 48% unfavorable rating  —   slightly worse than Ryan’s. ” This week Ryan’s popularity will face new challenges as the House weighs in on Trump’s tax reform proposal and funding the government. “A key to Ryan’s survival as speaker will be in maintaining GOP support in Congress, something that Boehner was unable to do,” Gallup reported."
What we learned about Melania Trump from her first international trip,"Washington (CNN) As the overseas debut of President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump draws to a close    the couple is set to return to Washington this weekend    there was the usual bluster and bravado from the President.  His   handshake with France’s new president made headlines. The speech to NATO was memorable, as was his brusque,   of the leader of Montenegro to make his way to the front of a pack of world leaders. It was classic, unadulterated Trump, a man the country has come to know for all of the above quirks, mannerisms and machismo. But this trip was especially telling about Melania Trump, a first lady about whom the country is still learning, four months into her husband’s administration. From the moment she stepped off the plane in Saudi Arabia, it was clear she had given thought to her wardrobe, using the fashion diplomacy tactic that worked so well for her predecessor, Michelle Obama. Her flowing black jumpsuit, by designer Stella McCartney, looked consciously similar to an abaya, the traditional robe garments worn by Muslim women in the region. In Israel, she donned white, a color considered by some Jews to be sacred, and a symbol of purity and peace. To meet the Pope, it was formal black lace with head veil. For Brussels, she donned a tan suit made by a Belgian designer and in Italy, both the Rome and Sicily legs, Trump stuck to outfits by the Italian fashion house of Dolce  Gabbana.  Clearly, her strategy of packing a bag for each and every event on the   trip, and the time she spent getting information from State Department officials regarding protocol, paid off. There was little in the way of a faux pas, even Friday, when she wore a $51, 500   jacket to tour around Sicily. But the trip was also telling about what sort of person the first lady is and how she interacts with her husband. For a woman of, so far, few words, it’s been the   clues that have shed the most insight. ”I watched her come off Air Force One with great interest, each time,” says Anita McBride, who served as chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush in the White House. ”They emerged from that plane as partners, she as the spouse of the President, fully prepared for her role.” Trump kept her own schedule, announcing in a statement ahead of time from the White House that she would have visits and events independent from those of her husband.  ”Of course, as first lady, on trips like these, she’s going to go off and do things on her own,” says McBride. ”But she went so far as to set the marker before she even left.” The first lady’s several solo ventures    two to children’s hospitals, where she spent time coloring, reading books, even smiling as she took selfies with the kids, showcasing a compassionate side    were a stark juxtaposition to the   personality of her husband, who, in addition to visiting the Middle East, attended his first NATO and   summits. ”She’s already shown that although public speaking might not be something she’s entirely comfortable with just yet, the actions she does take are genuine, and a window into the kind of person she is,” says McBride. ”She clearly and very carefully selected what she wanted to do and where she wanted to go on this trip, consistent with the types of activities she’s done back at home. She’s choosing things where it is something she cares about.”  McBride adds that Trump might even be more comfortable on the world stage, as someone who grew up in Slovenia and spent time abroad as an adult, noting ”That’s where she comes from, there’s a way she can draw from personal experience.” Whatever the reason, she has neutralized the spotlight that so often only shines on her husband. Except for that one, unexpected moment    swatting away the President’s hand on the tarmac in Israel. The move, which quickly went viral did, however, provide a bit of insight into the kind of person she is, especially with her husband of 12 years.  ”On that red carpet (on the tarmac) there were four people expected to be on that space, the Trumps and the Netanyahus,” says McBride. ”Trump is larger than life, in any setting, and he went out ahead of her a little bit, and it crowded her ability to walk with him and the Netanyahus equally. So he sort of pushed her off, and then realized what he’d done. She didn’t appreciate it, and she made it known. She’s not afraid to assert her opinion with her husband.”  For the remainder of the trip, the couple has held hands more often than they haven’t. On Friday evening, she posted a photo standing close to her husband, taking in the Sicilian sunset.  ”I think the fact that no one really knows what their relationship is like actually says a lot about how loyal their friends are,” says CNN contributor and historian Kate Andersen Brower, author of First Women: The Grace and Power of America’s Modern First Ladies. McBride cites Trump’s strategic appearances on the campaign trail, and a bit during the transition, as a clue to how loyalty might be one of the components to her marriage. It’s a trait those close to the president say he values.  ”She was out there when she was needed most, particularly in October, after the (Access Hollywood) video came out.”  Not only did she defend her husband, she timed a speech in Philadelphia to double down on the fact she was indeed sticking by his side.  ”In my mind, it was validation from her to the country that she loves her husband, and she believes in him, and you can believe in him, too. She plays this role for him in their marriage, and she doesn’t have to be a woman of many words to express that.” The lack of physical distance between the two on this international trip also provided a hint of what things might be like once the first lady moves   into the White House this summer. They have been together more in the past week, for more consecutive days, than they likely have since Trump kicked off his presidential campaign, and most certainly since he moved, solo, into the White House.  ”I think the fact that they are the only first couple to live apart is telling,” says Brower. ”They live separate lives, and don’t put on a show to make it seem as if they don’t.”  Yet, the opportunity to witness the Trumps together on this   tour is a learning tool of sorts, a way to see her independence, and his bravado, meld together for the first time in the public eye.  ”Ultimately,” says McBride, ”what this trip has shown is so much more of her on a daily basis. And that she fully intends to be a very active first lady.”"
Panicked GOP Establishment Turns Against Wall Street to Stop Populist Outrage - Breitbart,"Bloomberg’s Joshua Green writes that Republican consultants are reacting to the rise of populists like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders with harsh criticism of big banks like Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers. [From Bloomberg Politics:  When it comes to attacking Wall Street, no one can match Bernie Sanders’s conviction. But the Vermont senator’s eagerness to jail, fine, and tax bankers has overshadowed another group of politicians who have unexpectedly turned into vocal critics of the biggest banks: Republicans. At events leading up to the Feb. 9 New Hampshire primary, Donald Trump railed against what he characterized as corporate “bloodsuckers” who control the government through their campaign contributions —  echoing Rolling Stone writer Matt Taibbi’s description of Goldman Sachs as “a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity. ” Trump has gone after Goldman, too, accusing the bank of buying influence over Republican rival Ted Cruz. In January the Texas senator admitted that he’d failed to report to the Federal Election Commission loans from Goldman Sachs and Citibank of up to $1 million. “Goldman owns him,” Trump tweeted on Jan. 16. “He will do anything they demand. ” A Jan. 13 Bloomberg   Moines Register Iowa Poll found that this was Trump’s single most effective attack against Cruz.   …     Why are Republicans turning on the financial giants that have been their biggest benefactors? “Trump’s surge has been a big   call, and so has Bernie Sanders’s,” says Kristen Soltis Anderson,   of Echelon Insights, a Republican polling firm. “But Mitt Romney’s loss is still reverberating with Republicans, too. So many of them think, ‘That’s an election we should have won —  and we lost because we were never able to distance ourselves from being painted as the guys who drove the economy into the ground. ’”   …     The most striking example of a Republican targeting Wall Street is the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Richard Shelby of Alabama. Shelby, who’s being challenged by a Tea Party candidate, Jonathan McConnell, in the state’s March 1 primary, has already spent almost $3 million on TV ads —  more than anyone else in Congress —  many of them attacking Wall Street banks.   …     For Republicans such as Shelby, the purpose is primarily defensive: to stave off a populist insurgency from the Right. “Republicans never successfully litigated their own guilt or innocence in the financial crisis,” Anderson says. “They’re worried that voters will do it on their own. ” Read the rest of the story here."
Second North Carolina Poll Confirms Donald Trump’s Solid Tar Heel Lead Over Hillary Clinton - Breitbart,"NEW YORK  —   A second poll from the Tar Heel state in as many days confirms that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is leading his Democrat Hillary Clinton. [This poll, from The Trafalgar Group (TFG) shows Trump up by about five percent over Clinton —  specifically, a lead of 4. 97 percent —  outside the survey’s 2. 88 percent margin of error. Trump, at 49. 13 percent, leads Clinton at 44. 16 percent. Libertarian Gary Johnson gets 3. 59 percent and the Green Party’s Dr. Jill Stein gets 0. 49 percent, while 2. 63 percent are undecided. The survey was conducted from Oct. 27 through Nov. 1, with a sample size of 1, 154 likely voters. That means the poll was partially conducted before FBI director James Comey announced he was reopening the criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email scandal.  Pollster Robert Cahaly, TFG’s senior strategist, said that he thinks there is a   undercurrent of Trump support in key battleground states. “It’s our belief that there is a significant ‘Brexit’ type undercurrent of support for Trump that many polls are not capturing,” Cahaly said. “We have been asking a second ballot test question to measure who survey takers believe most their neighbors will vote for. In our Ohio, Florida, and this North Carolina survey we find a consistent pattern of Clinton support dropping  % while Trump support increases 4. . 5% for this question. ” “We believe the most accurate measure of support for each candidate is somewhere between how people answer for themselves and answer on behalf of their neighbors,” Cahaly added. “Lastly we have noted that there will likely be a major influx of participation from registered voters who haven’t voted since 2006 or before,” Cahaly also said. “This mobilization is reminiscent to the Obama turnout of 2008. These voters’ primary motivation is the rejection of the establishment, just as the Obama ’08 voters who rejected the establishment of that time. ” Trump does even better than the original numbers when respondents are asked whom they think their neighbor supports. In that question, Trump gets 54 percent even —  and Clinton drops to just 39. 88 percent. This is the second survey in as many days that has shown Trump breaking through in North Carolina into the lead. The   poll out on Tuesday showed Trump over 50 percent for the first time in North Carolina, leading Clinton by seven points —  well outside the margin of error. That survey had Trump up 51 percent to Clinton’s 44 percent. This all comes as early voting numbers suggest that Clinton is in serious trouble in the Tar Heel state, as the black community is not coming out to vote for her like they did for President Barack Obama in 2012 and 2008. Republican Mitt Romney won North Carolina in 2012, but even Obama is admitting now that black turnout in the state is way down. Obama is making two trips to North Carolina for Clinton in the final week of the campaign, and the Clinton campaign has strategically made the state its Waterloo as it’s bringing out the heaviest firepower it has there. North Carolina has 15 electoral votes, and if Trump can lock those in, along with Florida’s 29 electoral votes —  as well as the states he already seems to have in Nevada, Ohio, and Iowa —  he will be, along with the red states, at around 265 electoral votes, just shy of the 270 mark. Trump is trending upward in polls in Michigan, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Wisconsin and more in the final hours of a tumultuous campaign as Clinton finds herself under dueling FBI investigations. The FBI has reopened the criminal investigation into Clinton’s illicit   email server she set up in violation of State Department guidelines, and has been —  as was confirmed by a bevy of reports on Wednesday evening —  investigating the Clinton Foundation for over a year now."
"Battered by Storms, West Virginia Struggles to Recover - The New York Times","CHARLESTON, W. Va.  —   Cole Chapman and his wife, Silvia Gabriel Fields, were having coffee on their deck when a nearby creek suddenly burst its banks, sending them and their two children sprinting to their pickup truck for safety. “We heard cracking and popping, and a sheet of water just started pouring into the yard,” Mr. Chapman said Saturday night. “It was like something totally exploded. ” Minutes later, their yard submerged beneath gushing,   water, the family raced over muddy roads to higher ground. “My son was in the back seat, saying, ‘We’re going to die, we’re going to die,’” Mr. Chapman recalled. “I’m sitting there thinking, ‘I sure hope you’re not right. ’” The storms that swept West Virginia last Thursday created historic flooding and in the aftermath left hundreds of homes, buildings, bridges, roads and vehicles destroyed. The storms were tied to at least 24 deaths. The authorities said on Sunday that all of the people reported missing had been accounted for except in one county, Greenbrier, which suffered the greatest death toll in the flooding. Sixteen deaths were reported in Greenbrier County, all but one of them in the small town of Rainelle. The town’s mayor, Andrea Pendleton, wept as she surveyed her community on Saturday, The Associated Press reported. “I weep for my people,” she said. “I weep for the businesses. ” The county is home to a luxury resort and golf course that was scheduled to host a P. G. A. tournament from July 4 to 10. But the course, like much of the surrounding countryside, was overrun by floodwaters and the event was canceled. “Canceling the Greenbrier Classic is certainly the most prudent course of action as our foremost concern is the   of those who are having to live through this tragic situation,” the P. G. A. Tour commissioner, Tim Finchem, said in a news release. “Our thoughts and prayers are with them. ” The owner of the resort said that while it was closed for business, he would offer a limited number of free rooms and meals to house some of the people affected by the floods. The powerful storms appeared to have caught many people off guard. Hundreds of people were left stranded, and bodies that were recovered from houses  —   including those of a man and two women at one location, all presumed to have drowned, officials said  —   suggested that either people did not have enough time to flee, or did not heed warnings to evacuate. The state remained under a state of emergency on Sunday, with more than 17, 000 homes and business still without power. Late Saturday, President Obama declared a major disaster in the state that frees up federal funding for relief in three of the   counties  —   Kanawha, Nicholas and Greenbrier. More heavy rain is forecast for Monday in some of the areas in West Virginia already hit hard by flooding, but Greenbrier County is expected to be spared. Mr. Chapman recounted his family’s harrowing escape as his truck crashed and bounced over debris in the road. He said for what seemed like an hour, he fought through water, mud and rain to get to Clendenin, usually a   trip. The pickup almost flipped at one point, he said, as he drove over a fallen tree. “There was enough water hitting the side of the truck to make it rock,” he said. The family escaped, drenched, with little more than the clothes they were wearing. “I left with just what I had in my pockets,” Mr. Chapman said. When he returned to the house later, he said, he saw that their   aboveground pool had been lifted and dashed against the side of the house. The family has no flood insurance, he said, and he is unsure whether they will be able to return home. Storms had been in the forecast for Thursday, but their overpowering strength came as a surprise to many. Most of West Virginia and the western parts of Virginia received 1 to 3 inches of rain in a few hours on Thursday afternoon and evening, but the downpour was far more intense in some places. Parts of Greenbrier County, a sparsely populated area bordering Virginia, got 8 to 10 inches of rain, the National Weather Service reported. Power went out a couple of hours before the creek burst its banks, Mr. Chapman said. But he and Ms. Fields were unaware how quickly the swollen creek was rising. Neighbors reported finding out about flooding only after someone knocked on their door. Over the weekend in Clendenin’s tiny downtown, a church group grilled burgers in a parking lot next to a Dairy Queen that was demolished by the Elk River, which flooded to record levels. Another church group passed out clothes and cleaning supplies to those left homeless. In rural West Virginia, it is not uncommon for multiple generations of a family to live near the same small town. On Thursday, Ms. Fields and two other households of relatives were flooded out. Gerald and Naomi Fields, her parents, live in Clendenin. Mr. Fields said he knew they were in trouble when he saw “a massive amount of water coming off the mountain” on his way home from work on Thursday. He said a rescue team worked for hours to evacuate residents of a nursing home. “Those emergency workers literally put their lives on the line to get them out,” he said. “By 3 in the morning, when they were done, one man just collapsed from exhaustion. ” Another set of relatives 10 houses away lost everything. Ms. Fields’s older sister Erica Babbitt and her husband, David, said their house was ruined. “We’re going to be starting from scratch,” Mr. Babbitt said. For now, all 11 members of the three related households are staying at an empty church rectory in Nitro, west of Charleston. Mr. Babbitt said his church has rallied around them, feeding them, giving them clothes, shelter and a few personal items. Ms. Babbitt said she and her husband had been getting ready to move to Fairmont for a new job. “I was thinking about what it was going to take to move,” she said. “I guess I don’t have to worry about that now. ”"

Where the Trump-Russia saga goes from here,"’  ’ ”   During his  Thursday, former FBI Director James   Comey made several remarkable claims before the Senate   Intelligence Committee: that President Trump directed him to drop   his investigation into Trump’s former national security adviser,   Michael Flynn, and that the president fired Comey in an  of the FBI’s Russia   investigation. ” ”   On Friday,  denying Comey’s allegations and accusing the   former FBI head of lying under oath. ” ”   Despite the president’s alleged attempts to stymie them, several   investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election and   possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian   officials continue  —   perhaps with renewed vigor. ” ’   These are the related but separate investigations underway. ’ ’  ’ ’   After Democratic  over Comey’’s ousting and leaks about his allegations   against Trump, the Justice Department  former FBI Director Robert   Mueller, to lead the department’’s investigation into ”any links     coordination between the Russian government and   individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald   Trump.” ’ ’   Mueller  —   with the help of FBI investigators and DOJ lawyers  —     will also investigate whether any crimes, including  witness intimidation, or perjury,   were committed by anyone involved in the inquiry  —   including   Trump. ’ ”   While Mueller still technically reports to the Trump   administration (he was hired, and could be fired, by Deputy   Attorney General Rod Rosenstein) it would trigger enormous   political backlash if the DOJ were seen to be interfering in the   special counsel’s inquiry. ” ’   ”The incentives are in place for the special counsel to appear to   be conducting a thorough and   investigation,” Lisa   Kern Griffin, a professor of law at Duke, told Business Insider. ’ ”   Mueller, who is widely respected, was likely chosen for his     tenure running the FBI under both Republican and   Democratic presidents. Given that he reports to and receives   funding from the administration, there is a certain degree of   trust the public must place in Mueller’s ability to remain   independent from the president and his administration. ” ’   ”Given his qualifications, his reputation, his enormous talent,   his undisputed patriotism and the structure of the office he’’s   set up, it’’s fair to say that he’’s going to be very independent,”   Griffin said. ’ ”   But independence is not guaranteed, and whether Mueller’s   investigation is compromised in any way will not necessarily   become known to the public. ” ’   ”We certainly have no idea whether anybody behind the scenes is   telling him not to do anything, we just don’’t know,” Richard   Briffault, a professor at Columbia law school, told Business   Insider. ’ ’   ”We have to trust in his [willingness] to resign and or go public   should he feel that he is not being given adequate independence.” ’ ”   According to Griffin, there isn’t a clear way Mueller could come   forward if he experienced administration interference while   conducting the investigation. ” ’  ’ ’   If Mueller finds evidence of criminal activity, he could seek to   indict members of the Trump campaign, including, theoretically,   Trump himself. ’ ”   But an American president has never before been criminally   charged, and it’s very unlikely that situation could arise, in   part because prosecution is a function of the executive branch,   and the president runs that branch. ” ’   ”I can’’t see any circumstances in which a criminal prosecution   would be brought,” Peter Schuck, a professor of law emeritus at   Yale, told Business Insider. ’ ’   Even if the president shot someone in the street, he or she would   likely be impeached before facing criminal charges. ’ ’  ’ ”   Both the Senate and House are pursuing     investigations that cover more ground than the justice department   investigation. The congressional inquiries are looking into the   Russian interference in the 2016 election, and possible ties   between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, the   circumstances surrounding Comey’s firing, and leaks of classified   information. ” ”   While Mueller and the FBI’s investigations will be conducted   behind closed doors, the congressional investigators can hold   public hearings. ” ”   While Congress doesn’t have any power to prosecute, if the   committees uncover criminal activity, Congress can hold a vote to   impeach the president. ” ’   ”Ultimately, the president’’s jeopardy isn’’t so much legal  —   it’’s   political,” Griffin said. ’ ”   The House would vote to impeach the president, which is akin to   an accusation. Then, the house would act as the prosecution in a   senate trial. It’s up to senators to decide a president’s guilt. ” ’   But many say that without a majority of Democrats in Congress,   impeachment would be unlikely. ’ ’   ”There’’s not going to be an impeachment at this point, in this   Congress, unless fellow Republicans get really sick of him and   there’’s no sign that that’’s happening,” Charles Fried, a law   professor at Harvard and former solicitor general under President   Ronald Reagan, told Business Insider. ’ ”   Two other Senate and House committees  —   the Senate Judiciary and   House Oversight and Government Reform committees  —   are also   investigating whether Trump committed obstruction of justice when   he asked Comey to drop the FBI’s investigation into Flynn and his   subsequent firing of Comey. ” ’   Obstruction of justice occurs when someone acts with corrupt   intent while attempting to intervene in the administration of   justice. ’ ”   In addition, the committees are looking into Flynn’s ties to   foreign powers, including Russia. ” ’   Like with the intelligence committee investigations, these   inquiries could lead to more public hearings and, if Congress   concludes that Trump broke the law, it could lead to impeachment. ’ ’   Despite the hearings, revelations, and leaks, it will likely be a   long time before any conclusions are drawn from the   investigations, Griffin says. ’ ’   ”A   case of this type, even without the     dimensions, the international financial   evidence, the context of electoral politics, would ordinarily   take years for federal agents to investigate,” Griffin said,   adding that this case involves more urgency and resources than   others. ’ ’   ”It will be months, maybe even years, before they reach any   definitive conclusions.” ’ ’   But the length of the investigations could create its own   obstacle. ’ ’   ”Presumably, the White House could at some point say, ’’You’’ve had   a year, you’’ve had two years, it’’s over,’’” Briffault said. ’ ’   And the fact that so many investigations are being pursued   simultaneously will likely complicate matters. ’ ’   ”It is unfortunate because they’’ll get in each other’’s way,”   Fried said. ’ ’   Ideally, he said, there would be ”one bipartisan select committee   of congressmen and senators.” ’ ”   But Republican lawmakers are far from agreeing to the creation of   a special committee, so it’s no surprise there are so many   investigators on the Hill. ” ’   ”Everybody wants to get into the act  —   it is   Washington,” Fried said. ’ ’During his blockbuster testimony Thursday. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’"
Jackson Hole Ski Resort Forced to Close After ‘Unusual’ Storm - The New York Times,"Wyoming’s Jackson Hole got more of the snow that skiers crave on Tuesday night, but the heavy winds that came with it knocked out power and forced the area’s famed resort to close through the weekend. “This was a very unusual event for us,” said Anna Cole, a spokeswoman for the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, where the slopes were emptied, hotel guests were relocated and the electricity remained off on Thursday. “This will probably be the longest time that we will have to close during our operating season in our history. ” In ski resort towns across the West, snow is the economic lifeblood, and winter storms are usually coveted. Jackson Hole has already gotten more than 400 inches of snow this season, Ms. Cole said, about as much as the total from last season. But the ferocious winds that accompanied Tuesday’s weather toppled 17 steel electrical poles, local officials said, blocking roadways and turning off the lights at the resort and the surrounding area. Crews are working to restore power and clear the highways, but the weather has scrambled vacation plans and closed   businesses during one of the region’s busiest months. Jason Wallace, from Austin, Tex. was part of a group that rented a house near the resort and planned to ski at Jackson Hole this week. But while waiting for his connecting flight in Denver on Wednesday, he learned of the storm damage and decided to change his plans. He is skiing in Colorado instead. “I think we all were kind of lucky to make the call pretty quickly that it wasn’t going to work,” said Mr. Wallace, who hopes to return to Jackson Hole at some point. A Special Olympics event and Skijoring, described as a mix of “extreme ski and rodeo,” scheduled at the resort this week have been canceled. Jackson Hole’s last multiday closing during ski season was in 1986, Ms. Cole said, when there was a snowstorm and avalanche risk. Resort officials said they did not foresee reopening before Monday. “I don’t know that we’ve had a power outage for this length of time,” said Melissa Turley, executive director of the Teton Village Association, the government agency that oversees the area around the resort. Still, with electrical lines strewed across the roads, Ms. Turley said residents were thankful there had been no reports of injuries or damage to buildings. Local tourism agencies worked with the resort to find hotel rooms for displaced travelers. Though power remains off at the resort, the nearby town of Jackson has electricity, another ski resort and plenty of hotel rooms, said Kate Foster, a spokeswoman for the Jackson Hole Chamber of Commerce. Flights continued to arrive and depart at the Jackson Hole Airport, though major airlines have offered travelers the opportunity to rebook if they would prefer. American Airlines gave its customers the option to request a refund. On Thursday’s American flight from Dallas to Jackson Hole, more than half the seats were still occupied, an airline spokesman said. And in Wyoming, where local officials were weathering an economic blow during what had been a promising ski season, many still saw a silver lining. “When the mountain resort opens,” Ms. Foster said, “it’s going to be amazing skiing. ”"
4 Unanswered Questions Surrounding Murdered DNC Staffer Seth Rich - Breitbart,"Reports that Democratic National Committee (DNC) staffer Seth Rich was a source for WikiLeaks before his murder leaves us with even more unanswered questions surrounding the case. [1. If Rich was murdered in a robbery gone wrong, why was his wallet, watch, and phone left behind?  Following Rich’s July 2016 death in the Bloomingdale neighborhood of Washington D. C. police officers claimed that it was likely the DNC staffer was shot during a robbery gone wrong. This doesn’t explain, however, why Rich was found to still be in possession of all of his personal items, including wallet, watch, and mobile phone, which are often the primary targets during a street robbery. “There had been a struggle. His hands were bruised, his knees are bruised, his face is bruised, and yet he had two shots to his back, and yet they never took anything,” said Rich’s girlfriend to NBC News. “They didn’t finish robbing him, they just took his life. ” 2. Why haven’t the DNC offered a reward for information related to his murder? Numerous groups, organizations, and individuals offered a reward for information related to Rich’s murder, including WikiLeaks, GOP lobbyist Jack Burkman, crowdfunding bounty site WeSearchr, and author Mike Cernovich. The DNC and other Democratic Party organizations, however, have not. Rich’s death was memorialized by the DNC with a bike rack and plaque. 3. Why are the   and mainstream media ignoring the case? The murder of Seth Rich has been a hot topic among conservative, libertarian, and alternative news outlets since the incident took place last year, however the   and mainstream media has largely ignored the case, only mentioning the staffer’s name during conspiracy articles about Russian hacking. A quick Google search of “Seth Rich” will return dozens of news articles on the subject from sources such as Fox News, The Washington Examiner, and Heat Street, but few from outlets such as CNN or MSNBC. The Washington Post did publish a story related to Rich Wednesday afternoon but focused on Rich’s parents’ claim that reports of him contacting WikiLeaks were without evidence. Those articles which do appear on   sites all feature headlines which immediately brand questions surrounding his death as “conspiracy theories” and seek to deter investigations. The Washington Post published an article in August 2016 titled “Trump allies, WikiLeaks and Russia are pushing a nonsensical conspiracy theory about the DNC hacks,” while The Huffington Post‘s coverage of Rich’s murder last year consisted of stories such as “Donald Trump Has A History Of Linking His Political Opponents To People’s Deaths,” and “Conspiracy Theorists Won’t Stop Accusing The Clintons Of Murder. ” CNN published one single story on Seth Rich’s death last year —   a straight news article on the murder with a quote from former DNC Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The majority of   sites have also completely ignored the recent reports that Rich was the source of “thousands of internal emails” leaked to WikiLeaks before his death, despite the fact that they worked consistently to refute these claims beforehand. 4. Will the Democrats still push that Russia hacked the DNC? Despite the increasing amount of evidence proving the opposite, a frequent   talking point is to claim that it was “Russia who hacked the DNC” and leaked information to WikiLeaks. This argument, however, ignores the fact that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange stated on numerous occasions that Russia was not a source of the leaks, implying instead that it was Rich. DNC hacker Guccifer 2. 0 also allegedly claimed in messages to an actress that Rich was one of his whistleblowers, while a private detective claimed this week that Rich was in contact with WikiLeaks before his death. Most of the claims that Russia “hacked the election” are based on reports from CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm which has been reported to have ties with Google and the Obama administration, while the FBI did not examine the DNC’s server themselves. CrowdStrike’s report was heavily refuted by DNC hacker Guccifer 2. 0 in a report of his own. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

"Trump calls appointment of a special counsel a ’very, very negative thing’: ’I believe it hurts our country terribly’","’  ’ ’   President Donald Trump called the appointment of a special   counsel to oversee the FBI’’s investigation into potential   collusion between his campaign and Russian officials in the 2016   presidential election ”a very, very negative thing” that ”hurts   our country terribly.” ’ ’   Trump made the comments during a lunch with major network news   anchors one day after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein   appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to be special   counsel. That lunch was set to focus on his upcoming foreign trip   to Europe and the Middle East. ’ ’   ”I believe it hurts our country terribly, because it shows we’’re   a divided,     country,” Trump . ”And we have very   important things to be doing right now, whether it’’s trade deals,   whether it’’s military, whether it’’s stopping nuclear  —   all of the   things that we discussed today. And I think this shows a very   divided country.” ’ ’   ”It also happens to be a pure excuse for the Democrats having   lost an election that they should have easily won because of the   Electoral College being slanted so much in their way,” he   continued. ”That’’s all this is. I think it shows division, and it   shows that we’’re not together as a country. And I think it’’s a   very, very negative thing. And hopefully, this can go quickly,   because we have to show unity if we’’re going to do great things   with respect to the rest of the world.” ’ ’   Earlier  Trump   tweeted that ”this is the single greatest witch hunt of a   politician in American history!”  said ”with all   of the illegal acts that took place in the [Hillary] Clinton   campaign & [former President Barack] Obama administration,   there was never a special counsel appointed!” ’ ’’ ’   Prior to Trump’’s Twitter outburst and his comments to news   anchors,  reported   that he actually handled the news ”better than anyone expected,”   according to someone present in the Oval Office when Trump was   first told of Rosenstein appointing Mueller.

Tory-DUP Government Deal Expected Wednesday After ’Very Good Discussions’ - Breitbart,"Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster has hailed the “very good discussions” representatives of her Northern Ireland (Ulster) based party have been having with Theresa May’s Conservatives, with political observers now expecting an official pact between the parties as early as Wednesday. [Hoping to form a parliamentary pact with the DUP after the Conservatives’ collapse in seats following last week’s snap general election, negotiators from Theresa May’s Tories have been hammering out a deal with the   group Tuesday, in the second day of official talks.  Speaking to the BBC about the progress in negotiations, DUP boss Arlene Foster declined to “negotiate on the airwaves” but praised progress, and gave insight into the areas over which the agreement was being made. She said: “We’ve had some very good discussions again today, and these discussions continued into the afternoon. I hope we can reach a conclusion sooner rather than later. ” Hope we can reach a conclusion ”sooner rather than later”  —   DUP leader Arlene Foster on talks with PM Theresa May https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   BBC News (UK) (@BBCNews) June 13, 2017,  In words apparently chosen to reassure both her voters in Ulster and politicians in Westminster, Foster said: “It won’t surprise anyone that we’re talking about matters that pertain to the nation generally, bringing stability to the UK government, in and around issued around Brexit, obviously around  . ” Discussions are going well with the government and we hope soon to be able to bring this work to a successful conclusion.  —   Arlene Foster (@DUPleader) June 13, 2017,  As for what she expected in return for supporting the Conservative government, Foster said she had discussed “doing what’s right for Northern Ireland with respect to economic matters”. This remark could refer to points within the DUP manifesto that aim to make Northern Ireland more competitive for businesses than their southern neighbour, the Republic of Ireland. Amongst those initiatives is a cut of corporation tax to 12. 5 per cent  —   well below the Conservative goal of 17 per cent and the present figure of 19 per cent. More outlandish is the establishment of “freeports”  —   tax and customs free trading areas  —   in “economically underdeveloped parts of the UK” a sure euphemism for Ulster. Other ambitions laid out within the DUP manifesto while   for traditional conservatives have caused consternation amongst Britain’s political left. The manifesto promise to “freeze then cut or abolish the TV licence” and the possibility it may be a price demanded by the DUP for supporting the government, has so worried Labour deputy leader Tom Watson he was motivated to appeal to the Conservatives Tuesday that they would pledge not to scrap the licence fee. Writing to Conservative Culture Minister Karen Brady, Watson said: “The DUP’s manifesto includes a commitment to ‘freeze then cut or abolish the TV licence’  …     I urge you to fight hard to ensure that this pledge is not included in any agreement, formal or otherwise, between the Conservative Party and the DUP,” reports The Guardian. Slamming the BBC’s main source of income, a levy on all homes which have a working television set whether they watch BBC programming or not, the DUP manifesto said: “The TV licence fee is a highly regressive tax which was designed for a different era and a world of communications that no longer exists. The success of Netflix and Amazon streaming services shows that   media can and does work. ”  "
’At Least 2.5 Million Pilgrims At Papal Mass in Poland’ Say Organisers,"At least 2. 5 million pilgrims from around the world attended mass with Pope Francis on Sunday on the final day of a global Catholic youth festival in Poland, organisers said. [“We estimate between 2. 5 and 3. 0 million people,” 2016 World Youth Day spokesperson Anna Chmura told AFP of the numbers attending the event near the southern city of Krakow.  Sky News reports: More than 1. 5 million pilgrims have gathered in a vast meadow near Krakow for mass with Pope Francis. Hundreds of thousands of people camped out overnight in the field 13 miles from the Polish city ahead of the World Youth Day event. They turned up at the site the night before with folding chairs, sleeping bags, umbrellas and  . Francis waved to the crowds as he toured the site in his popemobile at the start of a ceremony on Sunday morning. Police said “over 1. 5 million” people attended the event. On his way to the site, the Pope made a stop to bless two buildings run by the Catholic charity Caritas  —   one was built as a day centre for the elderly and the other is a storehouse for food for the needy. As he left the storehouse, he tried some dark bread offered by women in traditional Polish costumes and nodded in approval. The   visit  —   his first trip to eastern Europe  —   is drawing to a close. He arrived on Wednesday and has visited Auschwitz, celebrated public masses, and held meetings with young people who have travelled from around the globe to see him. There has been tight security around the Pontiff following a series of attacks in western Europe, including the killing of an elderly priest in France. Police said no major security incidents have been reported during Francis’   visit to Poland. On Saturday the Pope prayed for God to rid the world of the “devastating wave of terrorism”. The medieval centre of Krakow has been overrun all week by   groups from China to Samoa and Mexico, who were entertained between masses with concerts,   and football matches. In a message to the world’s young, he said it was up to them to fight xenophobia and “teach us how to live in diversity, in dialogue, to experience multiculturalism not as a threat, but an opportunity”."
1st Sexually Transmitted Zika Virus Case Confirmed in Dallas County,"Dallas County health officials confirmed its first sexually transmitted Zika virus case on Tuesday, Feb. 2. [Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS) released a statement that lab results returned to them from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) came back positive for a patient who was infected with the virus after having sexual contact with an individual sick with Zika virus disease. The person ill with Zika virus returned from a country where the virus exists.  “Now that we know Zika virus can be transmitted through sex, this increases our awareness campaign in educating the public about protecting themselves and others,” said Zachary Thompson, DCHHS director. “Next to abstinence, condoms are the best prevention method against any   infections. ” The most common and relatively mild symptoms of the disease are fever, rash, joint pain and red eye. They last several days to a week. DCHHS advises individuals with these symptoms to visit their doctor if they have visited an area where Zika virus is present or had sexual contact with a person who traveled to an area where the virus is present. There is no specific medication available to treat Zika virus and, as Breitbart News reported, there is no vaccine. The best way to prevent Zika virus is to avoid mosquito bites and to avoid sexual contact with a person who has the illness. “Education and awareness is crucial in preventing Zika virus,” said Dr. Christopher Perkins, DCHHS medical   authority. “Patients are highly encouraged to follow prevention recommendations to avoid transmitting and spreading Zika virus. ” The DCHHS notes that sexual partners can protect each other by using condoms to prevent spreading   infections. Dallas County health officials also advise there are currently no reports of Zika virus   by mosquitoes in Dallas County, although the DCHHS cautions these   cases can make local spread by mosquitoes possible. DCHHS advises recent travelers with Zika virus symptoms and individuals diagnosed with Zika virus to protect themselves from further mosquito bites. Medical experts warn the virus has “explosive” pandemic potential. On Monday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Zika virus and its suspected link to birth defects a “global health emergency. ” Experts also suspect a connection between Zika virus and serious birth defects. During Brazil’s 2015 Zika virus outbreak, incidences of microcephaly, a condition where babies are born with small heads and abnormally deformed brains, increased. Breitbart Texas reported the CDC advised pregnant women to avoid traveling to the 24 countries seeing high rates of the virus in Latin America and the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico and the U. S. Virgin Islands. Cases of   syndrome, a rare paralysis disease, also increased during the 2014 French Polynesia Zika virus outbreak.

Mitch McConnell: Democrats should ’grow up’ and consider Trump nominees,"’  ’ ”   WASHINGTON (AP)  —   Republicans on Sunday defended their party   against Democratic complaints that Congress is being forced to   consider nominees for Donald Trump’s administration without   completed ethics reviews. ” ’   ”All of these little procedural complaints are related to their   frustration in having not only lost the White House, but having   lost the Senate,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on   CBS’’ ”Face the Nation.” ’ ’   ”I understand that,” he added, ”but we need to sort of grow up   here and get past that.” ’ ’   At issue is whether   —   in some cases   millionaires and billionaires with complex personal finances  —     would face conflicts of interest when it comes to overseeing   taxpayer spending. ’ ”   The  in some cases the office   hasn’t received even draft financial disclosure reports for   nominees appearing before Congress this week. On Wednesday alone,   at least nine Trump nominees are scheduled for confirmation   hearings. ” ’’ ’   McConnell suggested the complaints amounted to sour grapes from a   party that did poorly in the 2016 congressional and presidential   elections. The Kentucky Republican noted that Republicans were in   the same boat eight years ago when they had to swiftly confirm   multiple nominees who he described as ”wildly liberal.” ’ ’   But the director of the Office of Government Ethics, Walter   Shaub, said the Republican management of the confirmation   hearings is unusual considering that that in some cases, the   office had not received even initial draft financial disclosure   reports from Trump nominees. ’ ’   ”I am not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was   established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before   the nominee had completed the ethics review process,” wrote   Shaub. ’ ’   Reince Priebus, Trump’’s incoming chief of staff, rejected any   suggestion that Republicans should slow down. In an interview on   ”Fox News Sunday,” Priebus said Democrats ”have all the   information” they need and should move fast because voters   mandated it. ’ ’   ”Change was voted for and change we will get,” he said. ’ ’   Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer,  . Y. said the ethics   review is aimed at ensuring wealthy Cabinet members work for the   American people instead of ”their own bottom line, and that they   plan to fully comply with the law.” ’"
NY attorney general is investigating Trump Foundation practices,"Washington (CNN) New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s office is investigating Donald Trump’s charitable foundation ”to make sure it’s complying with the laws governing charities in New York,” he said Tuesday. ”We’ve inquired into it,” Schneiderman told CNN’s Jake Tapper on ”The Lead.” ”We’ve had correspondence with them. I didn’t make a big deal out of it or hold a press conference. But we have been looking into the Trump Foundation to make sure it’s complying with the laws governing charities in New York.” The inquiry comes amid a series of reports by The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity, The Donald J. Trump Foundation, on himself, used it to recycle others’ contributions to make them appear to have come from him and hasn’t given to the foundation since 2008. In another article, The Post had reported that the recipients of five charitable contributions listed by the Trump Foundation had no record of receiving those donations. But the newspaper updated its report after CNN questioned the accuracy of three of the five donations it had cited.  ”My interest in this issue really is in my capacity as regulator of   in New York state, and we have been concerned that the Trump Foundation may have engaged in some impropriety from that point of view,” Schneiderman said. The Trump campaign called Schneiderman ”a partisan hack who has turned a blind eye to the Clinton Foundation for years and has endorsed Hillary Clinton.” ”This is nothing more than another   hit job designed to distract from (Hillary Clinton’s) disastrous week,” said Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman in a statement. A source familiar with Schneiderman’s actions said the New York attorney general’s office is conducting ”an inquiry into the Trump Foundation about troubling transactions that we’ve seen.” The IRS fined the Trump Foundation $2, 500 earlier this month for making a $25, 000 political donation to a group supporting the campaign of Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi in 2013. At the time, Bondi’s office was reviewing allegations into Trump University and considering opening an investigation. A formal investigation was never opened, and Trump and Bondi have both said there was no wrongdoing and said the donation was not tied to any favors.  Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday sent a letter asking Attorney General Loretta Lynch to open an investigation into the Trump donation to Bondi. The New York attorney general’s office and Trump’s foundation have been corresponding since June, four letters CNN obtained from a source familiar with the correspondence show.  The correspondence begins with a June 9 letter from the attorney general’s office to both Trump’s presidential campaign and his foundation. The letter, from Assistant Attorney General Karin Kunstler Goldman, asks for information related to the $25, 000 donation to ”And Justice for All,”    the   PAC    including ”the dates, amounts and recipient of any political contributions made by your organization from January 1, 2013 to the present.” Trump Foundation treasurer Allen Weisselberg replied to the request in a June 28 letter, saying the contribution ”was made in error due to a case of mistaken identity involving organizations with the same name.”  Weisselberg asserts the foundation and Trump learned of the mistake in March 2016 after seeing it in the media and Trump paid the excise tax due with a personal check.  ”This was an isolated occurrence,” Weisselberg added. ”From January 1, 2013 to the present, there have been no other similar incidents.” Goldman replies in a July 15 letter asking for all documentation related to the ”And Justice for All” contribution. On July 25, the attorney general’s office receives a letter from Sheri A. Dillon, partner at law firm Morgan, Lewis  Bockius LLP complying with the requests. Schneiderman has already sued Trump University, and on Tuesday called it a ”scheme to fleece thousands of people all over America out of millions of dollars.” This story has been updated."
Trump Picks Thomas Bossert as Top Counterterrorism Adviser - The New York Times,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  —     Donald J. Trump has named Thomas P. Bossert, a top national security aide under President George W. Bush, to be his homeland security adviser, the Trump transition team announced Tuesday morning. Mr. Bossert will become assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, a position the transition team said would be equal in status to that of Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, whom Mr. Trump has chosen to be his national security adviser. The same position under President Obama has been a deputy national security adviser. The change in rank “reflects the unwavering commitment   Trump has to the safety and security of the nation, its people and territory,” the transition team said in a statement. “Mr. Bossert will focus on domestic and transnational security priorities as General Michael Flynn remains steadfastly focused on international security challenges,” it said. Officials on Mr. Obama’s national security team challenged the assertion that Mr. Bossert had been elevated to a higher position than his counterpart in the current administration, Lisa Monaco, who also has the title assistant to the president. A senior national security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters relating to the incoming administration, noted that Ms. Monaco was the chairwoman of the Principals Committee of the Homeland Security Council, had a seat on the National Security Council and participated alongside the national security adviser during daily national security briefings for Mr. Obama. The new designation for Mr. Bossert may suggest a desire by the new administration to reconfigure the national security apparatus at the White House. Before Mr. Obama, the homeland security adviser oversaw a staff that was separate from the one run by the national security adviser. Mr. Obama combined those into a single, unified staff when he came into office. Mr. Trump may be thinking about splitting them again. In the statement, Mr. Trump called Mr. Bossert “an invaluable asset” and praised the breadth of experience he would bring to the new administration. “He has a handle on the complexity of homeland security, counterterrorism and cybersecurity challenges,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Bossert served as deputy homeland security adviser for Mr. Bush, and he runs a risk management consulting firm in Washington. He is also a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, working on the research institution’s Cyber Statecraft Initiative. Helping to protect the country from cybercrimes is likely to be a major focus for Mr. Bossert in light of the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other incidents in recent years. Mr. Bossert will face the challenge of balancing cybersecurity needs against the privacy concerns of internet companies. “We must work toward cyber doctrine that reflects the wisdom of free markets, private competition and the important but limited role of government in establishing and enforcing the rule of law, honoring the rights of personal property, the benefits of free and fair trade, and the fundamental principles of liberty,” Mr. Bossert said in the statement announcing his appointment. News of Mr. Bossert’s selection drew praise from some members of Congress and former colleagues in the Bush administration, who described him as capable and knowledgeable about threats to the country. Representative Jim Langevin, Democrat of Rhode Island, also praised the choice. Mr. Langevin, a founder of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus, said Mr. Bossert had approached the issues of cyberthreats in a “centrist, bipartisan” manner. “I also hope that he will impress upon the   the vital national security concerns tied to Russian information warfare activities, and I encourage him to work closely with Congress in attempting to build our resilience and our defenses to forestall such operations in the future,” Mr. Langevin said in a statement. Frances F. Townsend, who was Mr. Bush’s homeland security adviser, said she was confident that Mr. Bossert would “continue to demonstrate the capacity and insight needed to take on the tough challenges facing the country. ” She focused in particular on Mr. Bossert’s expertise in another key part of the job: responding to natural disasters and other crises that require coordination among the White House, governors and other state officials. In a brief text message, Ms. Townsend called Mr. Bossert a “great pick” and recalled that he had helped lead the “  review” after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, helping to create more than 100 recommendations about how to better respond to such crises. “Tom knows the importance of   partnerships and most importantly how best to establish and strengthen them,” she said. Also on Tuesday, the transition team formally announced that Jason D. Greenblatt, the chief legal officer of the Trump Organization and a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump, would serve as his special representative for international negotiations. Mr. Greenblatt has been the  ’s business attorney for years, and in a statement, Mr. Trump called him “one of my closest and most trusted advisers. ” “He has a history of negotiating substantial, complex transactions on my behalf, as well as the expertise to bring parties together and build consensus on difficult and sensitive topics,” Mr. Trump said. As the president’s special representative, Mr. Greenblatt is likely to focus on peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians, renegotiating trade agreements and the relationship between the United States and Cuba, among other international issues."
"In New York, kindness flourishes after bombing"," (CNN) As it happens over and over again whenever we are confronted with tragedy or terror, small acts of kindness by everyday people offer up a sort of karmic balance in our world. This was in full display in New York after the Saturday night explosion in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.  Here’s how people are making a difference through simple gestures: They handed out coffee to cops, New Yorkers came out in large numbers to praise and thank first responders for their work. One of those stopping by was a local Starbucks employee who identified himself as Jermaine.  ”I want to give y’all some coffee and some pastries,” he said, passing bag after bag over barricades on Sunday afternoon. ”Thanks a lot, man,” a man in a fire department shirt replied. The gesture was captured in a   clip posted by KnightNews. com.  ”I wish I could give a little more,” Jermaine told the officers, but by the look on their faces, he’d done plenty. .. And pizza for lunch, NYPD officers maintained a presence throughout Chelsea on Monday, including the subway station on 23rd Street and Sixth Avenue, near the site of the bombing. To show their gratitude, people brought them boxes of pizza. The moment was captured by passerby Zach Escalante, who shared it on Instagram. They offered free rooms and dinner, The popular West Village hotel, the Standard High Line, opened its rooms to residents living within the attack area. In a Facebook post, the hotel said residents with proof of address could also eat  free. "
Cincinnati Trump Rally Planned for Sunday Cancelled **UPDATE** Still On? - Breitbart,"A Donald Trump event planned for Sunday afternoon in Cincinnati, Ohio has been canceled in the wake of the radical left’s violent and chaotic protest that shut down a Donald Trump event in Chicago on Friday night. [The Trump rally was supposed to be held just days before the crucial Ohio primary. It was scheduled to start at noon on Sunday, at the Duke Energy Convention Center.  USA Today reports: The Secret Service security supporting the GOP presidential front runner’s campaign could not complete its preparation work in time to hold the event at the Duke Energy Convention Center, said Eric Deters, a local spokesman for Trump’s campaign. “Trump wants to come here, and the campaign is still looking to find a location for either Sunday or Monday,” Deters said. This latest shutdown shows the momentum of leftist protesters, including Black Lives Matter. As Breitbart News reported, a rash of social media calls for Trump’s assassination have been posted on Twitter with no apparent consequences. **UPDATE** Donald Trump tweeted on Saturday morning that the Cincinnati event was proceeding as scheduled: The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled. Will be great  —   love you Ohio!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2016,  Breitbart News has reached out to Trump’s campaign for confirmation.

Naomie Harris: A Chameleon on Screen and Off - The New York Times,"The British actress Naomie Harris, 40, might have splashed on the scene as the Bond girl Moneypenny, but these days she is banking on riskier roles. Her turn as a crack addict in the lauded “Moonlight” earned her supporting actress nods for the Critics’ Choice Awards, Screen Actors Guild Awards and the Golden Globes, on Sunday. So, too, her red carpet style will keep you guessing. Friend to cutouts, splashy prints, allover sequins, tuxedos and plunging necklines, Ms. Harris seems determined to avoid being typecast. And the fashion establishment appears to love her chameleonic quality. She sat front row at Christian Dior and Michael Kors, and she attended the Met Gala with Burberry. Of course, Ms. Harris doesn’t accomplish her sartorial variety on her own. She has been working with Nola Singer, also a close friend, for the last five years. “She loves to experiment,” Ms. Singer said of their choices. “It’s not so serious. If I tell her someone is a new designer, she gets excited. She gets that this is a kind of freedom. That’s beautiful about her. ” Ms. Singer, who is based in Los Angeles, styled many of Ms. Harris’s looks over the past year, but the actress also worked with Micaela Erlanger, Lupita Nyong’o’s   for her “Collateral Beauty” press tour. With Ms. Singer, Ms. Harris has favored simple fitted silhouettes but often lets color do the talking. Witness a sequined goldenrod Ralph Lauren halterneck dress worn to the Hollywood Foreign Press   cocktail party in November. “Every actress was at that event, and she really stood out, not because she was trying but because of that color, and because it flattered her figure  —   her arms!  —   without showing too much skin,” Ms. Singer said. No   triceps dips were needed for the visual statement made by a Gucci silver metallic tuxedo at the Hollywood Film Awards the same month. Ms. Singer said the outfit, with its sharp tailoring and lion embroidered on the back, was a nod to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. “It was about women being empowered,” she said. Though Ms. Harris knows her way around a pantsuit (see also a white Emanuel Ungaro option at Variety’s Women of Power Luncheon, and a white   Dolce  Gabbana number worn to the TimesTalks event for “Moonlight”) occasionally she likes to go retro. In the navy Carolina Herrera ball gown she wore (with Christian Louboutin flats) to the Governors Awards in November, she was having an Old Hollywood meets modern practicalities moment. Less successful are her quirky moments. An orange Gucci minidress with a frilly black neckline that she wore at the British Independent Film Awards and a brown print Rodarte with    white bust at the “Collateral Beauty” London premiere read   on her lithe frame. Ms. Erlanger’s choice for the “Collateral Beauty” New York premiere was more on point: a neon floral Rosie Assoulin dress that ended above the ankle with Dick   pumps. Sure it was December, but what’s a little   chill when an   campaign is at stake? More unexpected picks with Ms. Erlanger included an offbeat (perhaps dated?) Stella McCartney strapless black bodice with sheer skirt design for the Critics’ Choice Awards last month, and a winning gold sequined tunic and pants by Monse at the Gotham Independent Film Awards in November. And if her predictability is in her unpredictability, Ms. Harris is throwing another wrench in for awards season. She is going back to Ms. Singer but adding the New York stylist Laura Jones, known for her work with Alicia Keys, to her team. It will be Ms. Harris’s first time working with Ms. Jones."
There’s a Lot We Need to Talk About - The New York Times,"Hey everybody! We  —   Wesley and Jenna  —   are introducing a new podcast today. It’s called Still Processing, and it’s a show about our promiscuous definition of “culture. ” We’re both writers at The New York Times, with very different focuses. Jenna is obsessed with Beyoncé, the evolution of the digital world and all things time travel. Wesley likes to think about the relationship among art, news and life in popular culture. The overlap of that Venn diagram is pretty much our show. We’ll be talking about the TV we’re watching, the movies we saw, the music we’ve heard, the books we’re reading tech etiquette, like how to slide into DMs and whether you should (quick answer: If you have to ask, as Wesley did, then no). We’ll get into the purpose  —   the real purpose  —   of Snapchat, the legacy of stars like Gene Wilder, the actual point of DJ Khaled (is there one?) and whether there ever was such a thing as good hair. But when tragedy strikes and the country threatens to go dark, we’re going to shine a light there, too. Anytime something like the Orlando shooting happens or Trump and Clinton start tussling about who’s a better friend to black voters, we’re going to talk about it. In our first episode  —   out today (!)  —   we discuss the flaps around Colin Kaepernick and Leslie Jones and unpack the repercussions of public patriotism and dissent. And because the two of us have a budding office romance, we decided to invite Tika Sumpter, who plays Michelle Obama in “Southside With You,” the romantic drama about Michelle and Barack’s first date, to talk about her worst first date. One thing we should note about our dip into the podcasting pool: We like the studio, but we love the world outside of it. We’re taking field trips to museums and restaurants and people’s houses. We’ll also invite on guests: the colleagues we admire at The New York Times, filmmakers, artists, writers, scientists, and regular people in our daily lives, like Jenna’s energy healer (no joke). We’ll debut new episodes of Still Processing on Thursdays, on all the usual places you find podcasts, including iTunes, Google Play Music, Stitcher and The New York Times itself. One more thing: We want to hear from you! You can find us on Twitter (@jennydeluxe @wesley_morris).

Politically Correct Schoolgirls Cover Up Their Own Sex Attacks At Hands Of Migrants,"Three teenage girls colluded to cover up sex assaults against them because they felt bad for their attackers and didn’t want to see them “discriminated against”. [Pupils at the Herder school in Kassel, Germany have been subjected to months of sexual assault by “much older” migrant males on their way to and from school, dating back as far as September 2015. The three girls aged between 16 and 18 were repeatedly touched inappropriately and verbally abused, but they refused to report the incidents to the police or their school because the perpetrators were “refugees”.  German newspaper the Hessian Niedersächsische Allgemeine reports the girls realised the “ ” implications of their reporting their crimes, with the significant amount of press attention swirling around migrant sex assault, leading to them becoming what the paper identified as “paralysed by political correctness”. One of the girls, identified by the pseudonym ‘Anna’ said of their decision to suppress the sex attacks: “We do not want refugees to be discriminated against. We do not want people making sweeping accusations [about migrants] [and we didn’t want to] foment bad blood”. The school says “many others may have experienced this harassment as well”. The girls were finally persuaded to come forward by a victim support group called ‘Kassel Help’ and they revealed how they were targeted by the men on public transport. The migrants who attacked them would find their way onto the same buses and trams daily to get near the girls, who were touched on the breasts, bottom, and between the legs. The report states “hardly a day went without harassment”. Called “whores” to their faces, groups of up to seven men would approach them at tram stops, shouting “Girls! Girls! Girls! ”. ‘Anna’ said the abuse “felt very threatening” but came as a surprise, as the abuse started on their very first day of the new school term. She said “I had not expected it at all. ” The attacks had put other girls at the school off using public transport altogether. Speaking to the Hessian Allgemeine, Steffi Burmester of the ‘Together Against Sexual Violence’ group said the organisation had seen a “huge” increase in sex violence come with the arrival of large numbers of “male migrants”. This was a phenomenon she attributed to the men coming from cultures with “different views of women” and a desire to reclaim lost masculinity after the “fear and humiliation” of being a migrant. Whether that is a credible reason or not, Ms. Burmester said it was “no excuse”. Given the sudden surge in sex crimes in Germany and other European countries by predominantly Muslim migrants, it is ironic that the news of these attacks comes just weeks after pupils from the school went on a ‘ethics’ class trip to their local mosque. According to a class report posted to the school website, one pupil said after the visit: “Overall, the trip was an enriching experience for the classroom and has brought us closer to the religion. ” These children are not the first to lie about sexual abuse because it doesn’t fit the mainstream narrative about defenceless, and peaceful refugees. Breitbart London reported on the case of a young female   activist who was gang raped by Sudanese migrants in the shower block of a camp on the   border in 2015. The other migrants in the camp were having a party and playing music, so her cries were unheard. Subsequently, after persuasion by other activists the woman decided not to report her rape because to do so would set back her dream of a borderless world. After she betrayed the political ideals of the other volunteers at the camp and reported the abuse, some of her fellow activists accused her of doing so out of “spite”.  "
#RESIST as Marketing: ’Fearless Girl’ Statue Taking Home Awards at Cannes - Breitbart,"The “Fearless Girl” statue which stands opposite of the iconic charging bull on Wall Street is racking up awards this week at Cannes Lions, the largest annual gathering of marketing executives. [The statue was commissioned on behalf of asset manager State Street and advertising agency McCann New York as a way of encouraging firms to hire more female executives.  “Its simplicity in the use of symbolism transcends geography, it transcends language, it transcends culture,” Wendy Clark, CEO of DDB North America, told Adweek. “For us, while it is a girl, it elegantly captures women’s journeys and our path to empowerment. And it also encapsulates our hopes and our ambitions for every little girl in the world. ” Clark also serves as the jury president of the Cannes Lions awards week, which was inspired by the Cannes Film Festival and takes place at the same conference center in Cannes, France. The “Fearless Girl” statue took home the Grand Prix in the Glass, PR and Outdoor Lions categories on the festival’s first day. The statue was sculpted by artist Kristen Visbal in an effort to encourage gender diversity amongst corporate executives. “The girl is standing there like this in front the bull, saying, ‘Now, what are you going to do?’  Arturo Di Modica said, who sculpted the Charging Bull statue. Di Modica argues that the “Fearless Girl” statue violates his artistic rights as it changes the meaning of the bull statue. “Remove her and place her somewhere else in the city,” Di Modica’s attorney said. “We’ve got lots of ideas. And damages must be awarded to Arturo for violation of his legal, statutory rights. ” Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.

Jordan Blames Israel for ‘Ugly Crime’ of Killing Terrorist in Midst of Stabbing - Breitbart,"JERUSALEM  —   Instead of condemning a terrorist attack carried out by a Jordanian citizen right outside Jerusalem’s Old City on Saturday, the Kingdom of Jordan blamed Israel for the “ugly crime” of an Israeli policeman defending himself by shooting the Jordanian assailant as the officer was being repeatedly and brutally stabbed. [Jerusalem Police Spokeswoman Luba Simri explained the policeman was walking down a street near the Lion’s Gate, an entrance to the Old City, when the officer was stabbed in the face and body by the Jordanian citizen,    Mohammed Abdullah Salim  .  “The terrorist rushed toward him, whipped out a knife that he had in his possession, stormed him and began stabbing him. The police officer responded with determination and in a professional manner, managed to activate his weapon and neutralized the terrorist,” Simri told reporters. A second policeman was stabbed in the hand while helping to subdue the terrorist, who reportedly entered Israel several days ago. The Israeli police released graphic video of the attack (watch it below) in which Kasaji can clearly be seen repeatedly stabbing the policeman, who had been knocked to the floor.  Jordan’s Foreign Ministry in Tel Aviv described the attack as an “ugly crime. ” Jordan was referring to the policeman’s   and not to the reportedly unprovoked terrorist attack by one of its own citizens. Jordan’s Minister of Communications Muhammad  ’man was quoted as saying, “The Israeli government, as the occupying power in Jerusalem, bears responsibility for the shooting of a Jordanian civilian who was killed. ” Mu’man failed to note that the terrorist, Kasaji, was killed while stabbing the officer. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the Jordanian statements. “It is time that Jordan ceases its double sided game. Just as Israel condemns terror attacks in Jordan, Jordan must condemn terrorist attacks in Israel. Terror is terror,” Netanyahu said. The Times of Israel further reported on today’s terrorist attack: The    police officer was taken to Jerusalem’s Shaare Tzedek Medical Center in moderate condition after the incident near the Lions’ Gate. He had wounds in the neck and head, and was conscious and in stable condition when evacuated to the hospital. A second man was lightly wounded, with cuts to the hand.   …    After the incident police arrested a local merchant who they suspected prevented   from helping the policeman during the attack.

"Trump: Budget ’Provides a Firm New Foundation’ for Safety, Jobs, and Prosperity - Breitbart","During Friday’s Weekly Address, President Trump said, “the first budget we are releasing provides a firm new foundation for the safety, and also for jobs and prosperity for all Americans in the years to come. ”  Transcript as Follows: “My fellow Americans, Each month families across the country work very, very hard to balance their budgets and to make the tough choices necessary to take care of their loved ones and to give their children opportunities they never had before. This is who we are as Americans  —   we take pride in leaving each new generation a better country than the one we inherited. Yet for decades, Washington has refused to make the tough choices. As a result, the American Dream has slipped from the grasp of more and more of our people. This has to change. We need a government that spends on the right things  —   the safety, security, and   of our people  —   and stops the waste and abuse of taxpayer funds, whether in America or in global projects overseas  —   of which, perhaps, there are too many. My administration is laying a new foundation to build a future of economic prosperity and achieve American Greatness. The budget we are proposing will reverse economic stagnation and open the path to millions of new jobs for American workers. We will balance the budget without making cuts in Social Security and Medicare. We will achieve our goals by doing exactly what you do in your home: setting priorities, cutting the fat, and growing new opportunities. And the big thing for me is economic growth, which is not possible without safety and security. We will grow our economy it is growing already. It will grow faster than you’ve seen it in decades. That is why our budget reverses years of cuts to our military that have made us less safe in a more dangerous world. We are going to make sure the men and women on the front lines of freedom have the tools they need to keep us safe and totally secure. At home, we are going to give our ICE officers  —   who have done an incredible job  —   and our Border Patrol agents  —   who are amazing people  —   everything they need to end the lawlessness once and for all. It is our moral duty to keep our citizens safe and free, and to protect the right of every American to pursue their dreams. We don’t want   roving our streets, we’re getting rid of them by the thousands, they’re going to be out of here.

ANDREW SULLIVAN: Trump ’is an extinction-level event’,"’’ ’In a sprawling  writer and political commentator Andrew Sullivan offers something of an ultimatum: The GOP elite ”must take the fight to Trump at every opportunity, unite with Democrats and Independents against him, and be prepared to sacrifice one election in order to save their party and their county. ”’ ’That is because, Sullivan ultimately concludes, ’ ’Sullivan finds a model for the current state of affairs in American politics in antiquity  —   namely, Plato’’s ”Republic. ”’ ’The gist of Plato’’s argument, by way of Sullivan, is that, given enough time, democracy becomes distrustful of elites to the point that ”There is no kowtowing to authority . .. let alone to political experience or expertise. ”’ ’At this moment in what Sullivan calls ”  democracy,” the tyrant  —   in this case, Trump  —   will ”seize his moment.” It’’s what Sullivan calls democracy’’s ”unique vulnerability: its susceptibility, in stressful times, to the appeal of a shameless demagogue. ”’ ’In making his argument that a Trump presidency would mark the true end of democracy, Sullivan cites the flattening effect of internet media (which replaces ”authoritative sources for even a common set of facts”) touts the spiritual disenfranchisement of   white men (those who comprise the mass movement that ”lashes out” in the form of Trumpism) and warns of the now   commonalities between Trump’’s rhetoric and ( )fascist precedent.’ ’While the newsworthy summary of the story might be something like ”conservative commentator calls for bipartisan cooperation to stop Trump,” Sullivan’’s indictment of the Republican frontrunner ultimately comes across as a corollary to his larger thesis  —   the one highlighted by the story’’s : ”The case against the people. ”’ ’’ ’The reader with the endurance to make it to paragraph 55 is told that the ”vital and valid lesson of the Trump phenomenon is that if the elites cannot govern by compromise, someone outside will eventually try to govern by popular passion and brute force. ”’ ’The upshot, apparently, is that Trump was right about one thing  —   the nomination system  and Sullivan urges for the exploitation of that very rigging: ”The GOP elites have every right to deploy whatever rules or procedural roadblocks they can muster, and they should refuse to be intimidated. ”’ ”Business Insider’s Josh Barro called a rule change in Colorado’s primary system  which seems to be Sullivan’s very point. If he is to be believed  —   a    —   too much democracy is what got Americans into this mess in the first place.” ’In a sprawling   cover story in. ..’"

Source: All-Out Ban on Semi-Automatic Long Guns Coming to CA Legislature - Breitbart,"In a recent conversation with Breitbart News, Gun Owners of California’s (GOC) Sam Paredes told us to be ready for an   ban on   long guns in California’s coming legislative session. [Paredes is the executive director of GOC, and he suggested the “assault weapons” ban and the “bullet button” ban have both been part of an incremental move toward banning all   rifles, whether “assault” style or not.  We discussed the surge in long gun sales, which are currently taking CA by storm. The surge is the result of residents trying to beat the “bullet button” ban, which takes effect January 1, 2017. You cannot buy an   with a “bullet button” after that date, but you are allowed to keep one with such a button if purchased before the new year. (For those who many not know, a “bullet button” is a mechanism that people in the other 49 states would refer to as a magazine release. With one caveat: the button only works when depressed with the sharp point of a tool or the tip of a bullet, thus the phrase “bullet button. ”) After discussing long gun sales, we asked Paredes if there was anything on the legislative horizon we should know about. He said, “These laws are the tip of the iceberg here in California. We expect they are going to introduce legislation to totally ban   long guns in California. They will do this because they know we will come up with a new way to beat their latest ban —  the ‘bullet button’ ban —  if given time. ” Parades added, “They had a bill for this last year that we were able to kill. We think they will bring it up again and they will also introduce legislation to put in place a     of any kind purchase limit. This limit will apply whether it’s a handgun or a long gun, in order to try to slow down the sales of guns in California. ” It must be noted that California has universal background checks. This means the only kind of firearms sales allowed in the state are those that incorporate a background check. Consequently, this also means that all the new bans, rules, and regulations being discussed by Parades are bans, rules, and regulations that will be applied to residents who buy their guns via a background check and this is a roundabout way of saying the bans, rules, and regulations will only apply to   citizens because they are the ones who follow the rules. Criminals, on the other hand, will buy their guns from personal   street connections and will face no limit on the number of guns they can buy per month nor on whether those guns are  .

"Chinese cruise ship capsized quickly, survivor says","Jianli County, China  (CNN) Most of the passengers on the Eastern Star cruise ship had gone to bed. A violent storm struck and rain pounded the windows with such force that water seeped into the cabins, survivor Zhang Hui told Xinhua, China’s   news agency. The ship began tilting, Zhang told the agency, reaching an angle of 45 degrees at one point. Small bottles rolled off the table in his cabin.  ”Looks like we are in trouble,” he remembers telling a colleague. When the ship with more than 450 people aboard overturned late Monday, he said, it happened so quickly he only had 30 seconds to grab a life jacket and get out of his cabin. He went into the dark and choppy waters of the Yangtze River during the middle of the storm, later confirmed to be a tornado. ”The raindrops hitting my face felt like hailstones. I tried to hold my breath, but water was forced into my mouth anyway,” he told Xinhua. Unable to swim, he hung onto the life jacket as he floated. He heard other voices in the water, but they soon faded. He saw the lights of a boat, but it passed, apparently not hearing his cries. ”Just hang in there a little longer, I told myself,” Zhang said, according to the news agency. Hours later, around dawn, he floated to shore and crawled to solid ground. He made it to a building, was taken to a hospital and called his family. ”I’m still alive,” he told them, Xinhua said. His wife and    son broke down upon hearing his voice, he said. A massive rescue effort is underway to find anybody who might have survived the capsizing of the Eastern Star. The ship was on a pleasure cruise along a stretch of the Yangtze that winds through central China’s Hubei province, authorities said. Most of the passengers were senior citizens. China’s   broadcaster CCTV reported Wednesday that 14 people had survived, 18 were confirmed dead and hundreds more were unaccounted for.  The other passengers and crew were feared trapped inside the ship, CNN’s David McKenzie reported from the scene. Divers were combing compartments onboard, Xinhua reported Wednesday morning. The survivors included the ship’s captain and chief engineer, who were taken into custody for questioning. Video showed the rescue of an elderly woman who surfaced near the hull wearing a diving mask. Holding a rope, she walked up the hull into the arms of rescuers.  Divers plunged into the river and rescue workers gathered along part of the vessel’s upturned hull that was sticking out of the water. They used hammers to knock on the body of the ship, which was almost submerged, and heard responses from inside, a   local newspaper reported. Welders used blowtorches in an attempt to cut the hull open. More than 1, 000 armed police officers, equipped with 40 inflatable boats, were participating in the rescue effort, Xinhua said. Rescue efforts continued into the night. Images of the upended ship evoked memories of the Sewol, the South Korean passenger ferry that sank last year, taking the lives of more than 300 people, most of them high school students. The captain of that ship was convicted of murder in April and sentenced to life in prison. In this case, the majority of the 405 passengers on the cruise were between 50 and 80 years old, according to a list published by state media. The youngest was 3. There were also 46 crew members and five travel agency workers on board, according to state media. All those on board were reported to be Chinese. Unless many more people are rescued, the Yangtze River sinking will become the deadliest passenger ship disaster in Asia since the Sewol went down. Ship capsized during storm, The Eastern Star had been making multiple stops on its journey up the river from Nanjing to Chongqing, a city hundreds of kilometers inland. River cruises along the Yangtze are popular among both Chinese and international tourists. The Yangtze is the   river in the world, stretching 6, 300 kilometers (3, 915 miles) from its source in the mountains of Tibet all the way to the East China Sea. The ship capsized around 9:30 p. m. Monday during a storm over the section of the river that flows through Hubei’s Jianli County,  authorities said.  It happened so quickly the captain didn’t have time to send out a distress signal, Wang Yangsheng of the Yueyang Rescue Center told Xinhua. The rescue center received the alarm from the crew of another boat who saw two people in the water. The captain and the chief engineer both said the ship had been hit by a ”longjuanfeng,” a Chinese word that can be translated as cyclone or tornado, Xinhua reported. The China Meteorological Center said a tornado less than 1 kilometer in diameter and lasting 15 to 20 minutes occurred, China Daily reported. The storm had wind speeds reaching 12 on the Beaufort scale, which calculates to   mph, the center reported. Alarm raised by survivor, Local authorities launched rescue efforts after receiving a phone call from a survivor who managed to swim ashore, according to Chinese media. The sunken ship is now about 3 kilometers (1. 9 miles) from the shore, where the river is around 15 meters (50 feet) deep, China’s   broadcaster CCTV reported. Relatives were desperately seeking news. Yan Mao told CNN that his mother, aunt and two cousins were on the ship after boarding it at Nanjing, the eastern Chinese city where the multiday river cruise began Thursday.  Yan said he was on his way to Wuhan, a major city roughly 150 kilometers (93 miles) from the area where the ship is reported to have gone down. ”I am anxious to find them,” he said. ”Of course, I believe they are alive, otherwise I wouldn’t go there.” Yang Min, a Shanghai resident whose parents and child were on the ship, said he was anxiously waiting with many other families for updates at a local government office in the city.   media showed images of relatives of passengers waiting for information at a makeshift reception center in Fuzhou, the capital of southeast China’s Fujian province. In one photo, a man wept while looking at a cell phone. The caption said that he had recognized his mother was being rescued. Premier arrives at site, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and other senior officials arrived Tuesday at the site of the disaster to oversee the   emergency response.  To help with the rescue effort, authorities reduced the amount of water being discharged from the Three Gorges Dam, the world’s largest hydroelectric plant, which is upstream from the sunken ship, state media reported. More than 4, 000 people and 110 vessels have taken part in the search and rescue, Chinese Transport Minister Yang Chuantang said at a news conference. Divers have been called in from all around the country, he said. A CNN team saw scores of military trucks and buses on an expressway heading toward the site of the sinking. Each one was packed with soldiers wearing orange life vests. Debate on social media, Chinese social media users weren’t waiting for the results of any official investigation before launching into a debate on whether to blame humans or the bad weather for the disaster. ”What could the captain have done?” asked one   comment in a popular conversation thread on Weibo, a   microblog service in China. But another   comment wanted to know if   measures could have been taken: ”How could meteorologists not have forecast the weather situation? If they did, why didn’t they notify those in charge of the ship?” The ship could carry up to 534 people, Xinhua reported. Tickets for the cruise cost between 1, 098 yuan ($177) and 2, 298 yuan ($370) with each room having air conditioning, a private bathroom and a TV. Passengers visited attractions during the daytime and returned in the evening as the ship traveled to the next port overnight.  China Daily reported the Eastern Star belongs to a   enterprise called Chongqing Eastern Shipping Co. which was registered in 1981.  China’s deadliest passenger ship disaster in recent memory is believed to be the capsizing of the ferry Dashun off the coast of eastern Shandong province in 1999. That sinking killed 282 people, according to authorities."
Buzz Aldrin: Retire the International Space Station to Fund Travel to Mars - Breitbart,"Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin spoke at the Humans to Mars conference in Washington, D. C. this week where he urged NASA to defund the International Space Station in order to dedicate more resources to exploring Mars. [“We must retire the ISS as soon as possible,” said the former Apollo 11 moonwalker on Tuesday, according to Space. com, “We simply cannot afford $3. 5 billion a year of that cost. ”  Aldrin believes that space activities in LEO (Lower Earth Orbit) should be conducted by private companies. NASA has indeed taken steps in that direction already, awarding contracts to companies such as SpaceX, the space exploration startup founded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Orbital ATK and Boeing have also recently been contracted to transport astronauts between the International Space Station and Earth. Aldrin believes that Bigelow Aerospace, Axiom Space or other companies should construct and maintain LEO space stations similar to the ISS, but operating entirely independently from NASA or the ISS. Aldrin hopes that these commercial space stations would share information with the space station that China plans to have in orbit by 2020, which Aldrin believes would help to encourage cooperation between China and Western companies. The creation of space stations in LEO is just one of the many plans that Aldrin has for further space exploration. Aldrin’s plans to colonize Mars also heavily rely upon “cyclers,” spacecraft that continuously move between two cosmic destinations in order to transport people and cargo. “The foundation of human transportation is the cycler,” said the    former astronaut. “Very rugged, so it’ll last 30 years or so no external moving parts. ” Aldrin predicts that various iterations of “cyclers” will enable a manned mission to a   asteroid by 2020 and could possibly perform a flyby of Venus by 2024. Based on Aldrin’s predictions, the first settlers on Mars would be able to launch for the planet by 2030. Aldrin believes that these travelers will not just be visitors to Mars but settlers. “Let’s be certain that we’ve developed a sustainable plan to stay on Mars,” he said. “No flags and footprints this time. ” However, the International Space Station is currently funded up until 2024. NASA officials and members of the Russian Federal Space Agency have also considered extending the life of the $100 billion outpost up until 2028. NASA has stated that the ISS is a vital part of their “Journey to Mars” plan, which will hopefully see astronauts in the vicinity of Mars by the 2030s.

Bangladesh Hikes Security After Top Islamist Hanged For War Crimes,"Thousands of police were deployed Wednesday in Bangladesh after the main Islamist party’s leader was executed for war crimes, in a country reeling from a string of killings of secular and liberal activists.[   party president Motiur Rahman Nizami was hanged at Dhaka’s Central Jail late Tuesday, after the top court upheld his death sentence for the massacre of intellectuals during the 1971 war of independence with Pakistan.  Nizami, a    former government minister, was the fifth and the most senior opposition figure executed since the secular government set up a controversial war crimes tribunal in 2010. Police erected checkposts on major Dhaka roads to deter violent protests and officers and the elite Rapid Action Battalion were patrolling the capital, officials said.   “Several thousand policemen have been deployed in the capital as part of the stepped up security measures,” Dhaka police spokesman Maruf Hossain Sorder told AFP. Security was also tight in Nizami’s northwestern ancestral district of Pabna after his body was taken under armed escort overnight for burial in the family graveyard. “At least 16 activists of Jamaat were arrested Tuesday night as part of the security clampdown,” Pabna police inspector Ahsanul Haq told AFP. Jamaat has called a nationwide strike for Thursday in protest over Nizami’s execution. Executions of Jamaat officials in 2013 triggered the country’s deadliest violence in decades. Around 500 people were killed, mainly in clashes between Islamists and police.   But a fresh wave of bloodshed is considered unlikely following a major crackdown by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government that has seen tens of thousands of Jamaat supporters arrested and detained. Mubashar Hasan, an assistant professor at Bangladesh’s University of Liberal Arts, said Tuesday’s execution sounded the death knell for the already embattled Jamaat. “With the execution of Nizami, the Jamaat leadership who revived the fortune of the party in the   period are now almost gone,” said Hasan. “It’s a big blow for the party. ” Hasan also warned that the execution and crackdown could further radicalise Jamaat supporters against the secular government in the   nation. “The party may have grievances and these grievances may lead to radicalisation, which would be suicidal,” he said.   The execution comes as Bangladesh is suffering from a wave of gruesome murders of secular bloggers, liberal activists and religious minorities by suspected Islamists. The Islamic State and a Bangladesh branch of   have claimed responsibility, but the government blames homegrown Islamists and accuses the opposition of trying to destabilise the country. Since last month an atheist student, two gay rights activists, a liberal professor, a Hindu tailor and a Sufi Muslim leader have been hacked to death.  —   Bloody chapter  —   In a statement on Wednesday, Jamaat reiterated that the charges against Nizami were false and aimed at eliminating the party’s leadership. But secular protesters cheered the hanging, with hundreds gathered outside the jail and at a square in central Dhaka overnight to celebrate what they called “a historic moment”.   Nizami took over as Jamaat leader in 2000 and played a key role in the victory of an   government in the 2001 general election. He was made a cabinet minister from  . The 1971 conflict, one of the bloodiest in world history, led to the creation of an independent Bangladesh from what was then East Pakistan. Prosecutors said Nizami was responsible for setting up the     militia, which killed top writers, doctors and journalists in the most gruesome chapter of the war. The trial heard Nizami ordered the killings, designed to “intellectually cripple” the fledgling nation. He was convicted in October 2014 by the International Crimes Tribunal, which has sentenced more than a dozen opposition leaders for war crimes. Rights groups say the trials fell short of global standards and lack international oversight, while the government says they are needed to heal the wounds of the conflict."
The Naked Hillary Clinton Statues You’ve Never Seen - and Lived to Tell - Breitbart,"The media have enjoyed every single one of the naked Donald Trump statues that have appeared in public squares in several major cities. Curiously, however, no naked Hillary Clinton statues have appeared. And it is not difficult to imagine the reason. [No, it’s not liberal hypocrisy, as Mediaite’s J. D. Durkin argues  —   though he is quite persuasive. (Durkin adds that even the public authorities are in on the gag, with the New York City Parks Department issuing a statement that it “stands firmly against any unpermitted erection in city parks, no matter how small. ”) Imagine the feminist frenzy over “ ” etc.  Nor is the reason, as Dilbert‘s Scott Adams might argue, that our society has become  . In a blog post in June, he noted that the Clinton campaign symbolized “The Humiliation of the American Male. ” Adams argued that men’s resentment would cause them to turn out in droves for Trump. If so, why haven’t liberals put up Hillary statues, to gin up their voters? No  —   the reason that no naked Hillary Clinton statues have appeared in public  —   thankfully!  —   is simply that anyone who saw them would turn instantly to stone. The decrepit frame, the wrinkles, the sagging flesh  —   it is best not to go into detail, for the sake of public health, but an anatomically correct depiction of Hillary Clinton would be more devastating than a deliberately distorted depiction of Donald Trump’s genitalia. Plus, not even ancient Perseus himself would be able to figure out a way to remove it. One correspondent on Twitter claimed  —   horrors!  —   to have actually attempted to put up a Hillary statue. Evidently, it would not stand on its own for more than five minutes without being supported by a phalanx of masculine aides, who tired quickly. Thus was western civilization saved. In truth, there is beauty in the human form in all its varieties. We are all made in God’s image, after all. But as long as the left insists on ugliness, ugliness they shall deserve.

UK received live anthrax from Pentagon,"Washington (CNN) The UK has joined the list of countries that unintentionally received shipments of live anthrax samples from the Pentagon. However, British authorities said the samples, from 2007, were no longer a threat. ”We do not believe there is any continuing health risk to staff or to the public,” the UK’s Health and Safety Executive said in a statement, noting that the company at issue    which is not being named    has been in touch with the Defense Department about the matter. South Korea, Australia and Canada have already been named as recipients of questionable anthrax samples, along with 19 states and the District of Columbia. Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work said last week that he expects the numbers of labs suspected of receiving live anthrax to go up as the Pentagon continues its investigation into the shipments, some of them made via FedEx. When put in the mail, the samples were not believed to contain live samples of the disease. There have been ”no suspected or confirmed cases of anthrax infections” as a result of the shipments, Work said, explaining that the samples that were sent out had very low concentrations of the deadly disease, which could not infect the ”average healthy individual.” RELATED: Pentagon may have received live anthrax, ”We know of no risk to the general public from these samples,” Work emphasized. The four Defense Department laboratories that stockpile anthrax samples for research will test all previously ”inactivated” samples to ensure that the anthrax is in fact dead. The department is testing over 400 batches, with live anthrax found so far in four of those batches. ”That is why the numbers may rise,” Work said, adding that it takes 10 days to test anthrax samples. The Pentagon will investigate why the anthrax samples were not properly killed before they were shipped and what protocols and procedures failed in the process. The press conference was the first public accounting of the investigation into the shipment of live anthrax samples, which was initially reported last week. The Pentagon Force Protection Agency, the Pentagon’s police force, is one of the agencies that received questionable U. S. Army shipments of anthrax. That shipment now must be tested to see if it has live rather than dead pathogen. The Pentagon police received a shipment of what was supposed to be dead anthrax agent from one of three original lots, all of which are now shown to contain live, rather than dead, anthrax."

Trump is turning his Cabinet-appointment process into its own reality show,"’  ’ ”   Drama and showmanship has surrounded   Donald   Trump’s selection of his Cabinet  —   in typical Trump fashion. ” ’   Trump has hyped and teased who he will pick to serve in his   administration,  the ”finalists.” ’ ’     cameras    allowing curious viewers to watch the spectacle from their own   homes. ’ ’   And this week, there was a very public feud about the possibility   of Mitt Romney being tapped to serve as secretary of state, as   Trump allies  over   whether he should be selected for the top diplomatic post. ’ ’   ”Is it a good way to pick a cabinet? Not especially,” said Reed   Galen, who served in the George W.

"Republicans, Facing Pressure, Delay Hearings for 4 Trump Cabinet Nominees - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Senate Republicans, under increasing pressure to ensure that   Donald J. Trump’s nominees are fully vetted by federal authorities, have delayed the hearings of four potential cabinet members, three of whom have not been cleared by the agency charged with unraveling potential conflicts of interest. As frustrations over confirmations grow, a group that supports Republicans accused the ethics office and its leader  —   in a highly unusual attack on the nonpartisan agency  —   of politicizing a process long viewed by both parties as arduous but essential for anyone serving in government. Hearings for Betsy DeVos, Mr. Trump’s choice to lead the Department of Education Andrew Puzder, his labor secretary nominee and Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, Mr. Trump’s pick to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, have all been pushed back as Democrats clamor for more time to collect and review the standard background checks that nominees traditionally undergo before their hearings commence. Wilbur Ross, Mr. Trump’s pick for secretary of commerce, will also be delayed several days because his ethics agreement is not complete, according to the chairman and ranking Democrat of the commerce committee. The delays represent a stumble for the incoming Trump administration, which has vowed to run government with a businesslike efficiency, and highlights how in several respects its preparation to take office is behind that of predecessors. In the case of Ms. DeVos, a billionaire, a complex web of financial holdings may be slowing down the Office of Government Ethics, which helps federal officials address conflict of interest matters, while Mr. Puzder’s background documents are also not in order. Walter M. Shaub Jr. the director of the ethics office, said in a letter to Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, that he did not know when Ms. DeVos would be cleared by his agency as this was “dependent on the nominee to provide needed information, respond to questions and accept the terms of an ethics agreement. ” Republicans have vowed hearings for as many nominees as possible before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, so that they can be cleared to served immediately, particularly those posts associated with national security. “We will be in a position to confirm a significant number of the president’s nominees on day one,” said the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said Tuesday on the Senate floor, “This new hearing schedule is a very good first step, but we still have a ways to go. ” Mr. Trump’s aides have been pressuring the ethics office to expedite its processes, even though it did not get the necessary paperwork from most of his nominees until recently, putting Republicans in a difficult position of either pushing forward with hearings without proper vetting  —   something most of the chairmen are loath to do  —   or delaying them in some cases indefinitely. “Trump is the latest   to begin the process in contemporary history,” said Paul C. Light, a professor of Public Service at New York University who worked on Capitol Hill as an adviser on transitions. “This puts the Republicans under pressure and sets up possible problems down the road. Mr. Trump is asking the Senate to make up for his own failures here. ” The conservative organization America Rising PAC took aim at Mr. Shaub on Monday, highlighting his “history as a Democrat and the double standard he employed as head” of the agency, highlighting his political donations to President Obama as well as his office’s “utter incompetence” in policing financial matters related to Hillary and Bill Clinton. The PAC chided Mr. Shaub for wading into the politics of the transitions, saying his public comments and criticisms had become fodder for “Congressional Democrats to try and score points. ” The PAC noted an informal  —   and    —   series of postings on Twitter from the office’s official account congratulating Mr. Trump on divesting from his real estate business  —   a move he had not made. “The head of President Obama’s ethics department has absolutely zero credibility to criticize others,” Scott Sloofman, a spokesman for America Rising PAC, said in an email, adding that Mr. Shaub’s “outburst over the weekend reeks of partisan politics from an embittered Democrat still reeling from November’s election result. ” In messages posted to Twitter on Tuesday, the office wrote that it is “Moving quickly!”  —   noting that it had   54 percent of the nominees it has received from the Trump transition team, compared with 29 percent at the same point in 2009. “OGE is expediting reviews of the financial disclosure reports of the  ’s nominees, without sacrificing quality,” the agency said on Twitter. An employment lawyer by trade, Mr. Shaub joined the Office of Government Ethics in 2006, during the administration of George W. Bush, working as a supervisory lawyer. In 2008, he became a deputy general counsel, and then President Obama in 2013 nominated Mr. Shaub as director of the office. Ethics experts who have worked closely with the office and Mr. Shaub said the criticisms of him seemed unfair. “For simply doing his job, director Shaub is now being unfairly attacked,” Norman L. Eisen, a former special counsel for ethics and government reform under Mr. Obama, and Richard W. Painter, the chief White House ethics lawyer to Mr. Bush, said in a joint statement. “It seems that it is open season on ethics in Washington, D. C. Last week the nonpartisan, independent Office of Congressional Ethics was attacked, and now the nonpartisan, independent Office of Government Ethics and its director are being targeted. ” They added, “This attempt to bully and intimidate a hardworking, understaffed agency like O. G. E. must not go unchecked. ” The compliance office work on the transition got off to a cordial and even enthusiastic start during the final months of the campaign, and continued after the election, according to a series of emails between ethics officials and Mr. Trump’s representatives obtained through public records requests by MSNBC and the James Madison Project. “Congratulations on the campaign’s victory,” Mr. Shaub wrote members of Mr. Trump’s transition team on the morning after Election Day, just hours after his victory, adding, “We’re really looking forward to getting down to work on this presidential transition  —   which we’re going to make one of the best in history!”"
"Branding Day, Fading Elsewhere, Still a Ritual on Colorado Ranch - The New York Times","DENVER  —   Time has changed much in the American West. On some ranches, cowboys round up cattle on   and track livestock with drones. While technology is easing tasks, though, some think it is also threatening the skills that make a cowboy a cowboy: roping, riding and a   devotion to hard work. But for centuries, neighbors have gathered each spring for a day of branding newborn animals.   cattlemen pull a hot iron from the fire, and calves mewl as curved steel singes hair and burns flesh. Afterward, there is cheap beer and a meal, maybe a band and a dance. The branding process has been criticized as cruel. And some families have moved to other methods, including freeze brands created with liquid nitrogen and ear tags they can read with an electronic wand. Perhaps the most notable innovation is the calf table, a viselike device that allows people to trap, flip and mark an animal, eliminating the need for a crew of helpers. In some places, that is sending the community gathering known as branding day into the past. But not on Bill Gray’s ranch, outside Ordway, Colo. Mr. Gray, 65, is a   rancher who still tracks and marks his cattle the old way. His brand serves a practical purpose, allowing him to prove ownership at sale and ward off cattle thieves. (Rustling is not just a crime of the past.) “You can put the ear tag in them,” he said. “But you can tear the ear tag out. ” He has two symbols he uses to identify livestock. One, called a    was passed to him by his grandfather, like a family crest. Ordway is three hours southeast of here and has about 1, 000 people. Mr. Gray calls on many of them to help in the ritual. “Tradition has a lot to do with it,” he said. “Part of ranching is neighbors helping neighbors. ” Among his chief concerns is an   divide. “I’m sure urban people think that what we do, some of the practices, are barbaric. But they’re not,” he said. “If I mistreat my cattle, it’s going to cost me money. I can’t do that. ” As for his neighbors who have moved to calf tables, “I don’t hold it against them,” he said. “Some people need to use it if they’re not proficient at what we do. ” Mr. Gray has eight children and 22 grandchildren and has been through a lot lately. A dry period lasting 14 years was followed by a recent drop in cattle prices. In February, his home burned down, cause undetermined. On a recent day, Mr. Gray’s roundup began just as the sun bumped over the muddy prairie. His son, his grandson, his neighbors and part of the high school wrestling team rode up to help. Cowhands on horseback pushed hundreds of animals into corrals, and ropers lassoed the calves by the legs, flipping them onto their sides. Flankers rushed to hold the animals down as older men took out the irons. Next came vaccination, the injection of a growth hormone and, for the males, castration. Many brandings are governed by an unspoken cowboy etiquette: Young people wrestle the cattle onto the ground, while older ones handle the iron. But Mr. Gray said that he was a bit different. “I try to let everybody do some of the jobs,” he said. “That way, when it comes their time, they’ll know how to do it. ”"
Did Brennan Start Russia Investigation Because of Liberal Media Bias? - Breitbart,"Former CIA director John Brennan testified before the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday that he was not sure if there was any evidence of collusion between the Russian government and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. [Yet Democrats are thrilled by his testimony, because he said there were contacts between Russian officials and some “U. S. persons involved in the Trump campaign,” and hence an FBI investigation was warranted.  Note that there is nothing new in what Brennan said. The New York Times reported on January 19  —   in a story timed to appear on Inauguration Day  —   that the intelligence services had “intercepted communications” between several Trump “associates” and Russian officials. (The same story said there was “no conclusive evidence of wrongdoing. ”) And last week, Reuters reported that there were 18 such contacts  —   over seven months, less than three per month. All that Brennan presented was his opinion. And it is not clear what prompted his opinion. He said he convened a group, including the FBI and NSA, to investigate possible Russian attempts to affect the election in late July 2016. What else happened in late July? In late July, Donald Trump held a press conference at which he was pestered about Russia. After several minutes, he joked: “It’s just a total deflection, this whole thing with Russia   …     By the way, they hacked  —   they probably have her 33, 000  . Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30, 000   that are missing. ” Trump was joking, but the media inflated his remarks into a serious attempt to invite foreign intervention in the election. Some Democrats even accused him of treason. It is not unreasonable to wonder whether Brennan followed the liberal media down a Russian   where the absence of evidence would not end his suspicions.

Academy Says Diversity Purge is ’Not About Political Correctness’,"The leadership at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) defended the organization’s controversial new diversity initiative, saying in an interview that the Academy did not bow to outside pressure when crafting the rule changes, which many are criticizing as an overt effort to purge older Academy members of their voting privileges while aggressively recruiting new voting members who, in the words of the Academy, “represent greater diversity. ”[In an extensive interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Academy CEO Dawn Hudson and president Cheryl Boone Isaacs defended the dramatic overhaul of the organization’s Oscar voting rules, which came in response to mounting criticism and calls for a boycott of this year’s ceremony when no black actor was nominated for an Oscar for the second year in a row.  Some critics, including longtime members of the Academy, have accused the organization of purging itself of older, white male Oscar voters in direct response to a media firestorm. The Academy has said it hopes to double the number of female and minority members by 2020. Academy CEO Dawn Hudson told THR that all the talk of the Academy caving to political correctness “makes me a little crazy. ” “The Academy is   it is   it is not trying to be politically correct, never has been,” she told the outlet. “We are an elite institution. That elite institution is part of who we are, and that definition won’t change. We are the best of the best in the film industry. We don’t feel that we have looked far and wide enough for the best of the best. ” “It’s not about political correctness, it’s about building the best team, the best institution, the best artists,” Hudson continued. “Because unless you have the best artists as members, unless you have the best artists voting on the Academy Awards, you don’t have a real reflection of the best of our film culture. We’re not talking about [just these] nominations. The nominations we can’t control. ” Hudson added that by stripping Oscar voting rights from longtime members who have been inactive in the film business for ten years, the Academy was getting back to its “original intention. ” “That’s how we’re culling the members, the ranks of voting members,” she said. “They will still be members, they just will lose the ability to vote on a community that they are not really a part of. ” On Monday, Mark Reina, a longtime member of the Academy who is gay and Latino, published an open letter to Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs blasting what he called the organization’s assumption that he is racist. Boone Isaacs said it was “unfair” that older members of the Academy were being labeled. “I certainly understand the hurt because people they don’t even know are making a judgement about them and about their artistic integrity and their artistic taste,” she told the outlet. “So I can understand why our members are insulted by this. I think that is absolutely unfair because we don’t know how they voted. ” “And yet you want to make sure the membership is as reflective of our contemporary film culture and film community as possible,” added Hudson. The duo also weighed in on the stars who have pledged to boycott the ceremony, including Will Smith, whom Boone Isaacs said was still welcome “with open arms. ” And as for Spike Lee? “I have no idea,” Boone Isaacs said. “Spike is Spike. He follows his own heart. This is a person we all know. He is faithful to himself, and he made a decision, which he came out with publicly, and it’s his decision. But we are very proud of our relationship with Spike. ” Check out THR‘s complete interview with Cheryl Boone Isaacs and Dawn Hudson here."
AP’s Pace: Clinton Campaign ’Laughed’ at Bill For Caring About Rural Voters - Breitbart,"On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” the White House correspondent for the Associated Press Julie Pace said the campaign of Hillary Clinton “laughed at and ridiculed” former President Bill Clinton for wanting Hillary’s campaign to spend more time courting rural voters who are credited for being a large part of the decisive win for   Trump.  Pace said Bill Clinton was “laughed at and ridiculed by a lot of people in the Clinton campaign. ” She continued, “After the Wisconsin primary when Bill Clinton wanted Hillary to spend more time there they laughed at him. They laughed at him and basically said he’s going after the voters that supported him instead of the ones that she will need. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN"
"Peter Thiel: Globalization is Over, ’It Feels so Dated’ - Breitbart","Billionaire tech entrepreneur and adviser to President Trump, Peter Thiel, declared globalization to be over on Tuesday, claiming it’s “so 2005, it feels so dated. ”[“I’m naturally inclined to think of it in those terms,” said Thiel on the topic of how Trump’s victory showed the American people’s dissatisfaction with globalization. “There’s something around globalization that’s not been working that well. ”  “The internet was designed to survive a nuclear war, but even so, I think there are a lot of regulatory challenges that Silicon Valley will be facing from Western Europe and elsewhere in the years ahead,” he continued. “There’s a technological determinism story you can tell where this is the future and China will eventually buckle under and cave and eventually adopt all of these things. But then you might wonder, maybe this doesn’t happen at all, and maybe it’s possible for the internet to actually fragment and not to have this historical necessity to it. ” According to CNBC, Thiel added that “No one in their right mind would start an organization with the word ‘global’ in its title today,” before claiming “That’s so 2005, it feels so dated. ” “A decade ago, this was a group of people who were running the world, and now, it’s just a group of people who messed up the world,” concluded Thiel. “I’m not sure this is a good thing, but it is a fact that maybe politics is becoming more important, it’s becoming more intense, the range of outcomes is becoming greater, and that we’re in a world in which there’s a bull market in politics that’s getting started. ” Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

"PHOTOS: The Battle for Mosul, Iraq Has Begun - Breitbart","The government of Iraq announced at 2AM local time Monday that the initiative to eradicate the Islamic State from Mosul, the nation’s second largest city, has begun. [Iraqi forces, alongside with Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga troops, captured nine villages surrounding the northern Iraqi city, working to surround the city and eradicate the jihadist fighters embedded there. “We have liberated 200 square kilometers so far,” Iraqi Kurdish President Masoud Barzani said, according to the Agence  . The Iraqi government issued a similar statement, telling reporters that the Islamic State had suffered “heavy losses of life and equipment” in the outskirts of the city.  Barzani noted that the cooperation between the Iraqi military and the Kurdish Peshmerga was a first: “This is the first time that the block of the Peshmerga forces and the Iraqi army are mixed and shared in the battlefield against the terrorist organization. ” Iraqi Prime Minister Haider   announced the offensive on Monday morning, addressing the people of Mosul directly. “These forces that are liberating you today, they have one goal in Mosul, which is to get rid of Daesh [Isis] and to secure your dignity. God willing, we shall win,” he said in a nationally televised speech. The Iraqi government had initially attempted an operation to free Mosul in March, but was forced to “halt” it as Iraqi forces alone were insufficient to take the city, particularly given the challenge of identifying and disarming the complex series of mines and booby traps the Islamic State has installed around the city’s perimeter. Now, the estimated 30, 000 troops entering the city also include   Peshmerga, who have seen some of the most success of all militias fighting ISIS in the region. The coalition will also receive the aid of the U. S.    State coalition, which will be providing air support. American officials have said they expect a “lasting defeat” of the Islamic State after this operation. The Syrian government appears to support the measure, though an exodus of Islamic State terrorists out of Iraq may detrimentally affect the fight in Syria. The government of Turkey, meanwhile, insists it will play a role in the Mosul operation, despite Abadi repeatedly demanding Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan move his troops out of his country. While Ankara’s relationship with Baghdad is frayed, Erdogan has long enjoyed the support of the Kurdish government in Erbil.  AHMAD     Images, “What do they say? Turkey shouldn’t enter Mosul. Why can’t we enter? We have a   border [with Iraq],” Erdgan said Monday. “Others who have nothing to do with the region are entering it. We will not be responsible for the negative consequences that will emerge from any operation that doesn’t include Turkey. We will be involved both in the operation and at the [negotiating] table afterward. It is not possible for us to stay excluded,” he argued. The Turkish outlet Hurriyet reports that Erdogan has deployed a diplomatic delegation to Baghdad. The Islamic State captured Mosul in 2014, forcing its entire Christian population to flee or face death or conversion and imposing Sharia law on the populace. Millions remain in the city, however, and the United Nations has warned that the operation may trigger another refugee flood, potentially sending over one million fleeing to Erbil, already home to thousands of Christian refugees. The Kurdish outlet Kurdistan 24 has published videos of the beginning of the operation: "

Officials to Close Standing Rock Protest Campsite - The New York Times,"Citing public safety concerns, federal officials plan to close access to a campsite where demonstrators have protested the construction of a crude oil pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota and create a “free speech zone. ” The Army Corps of Engineers, in a letter Friday to the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Dave Archambault II, said the decision had been made to “protect the general public from the violent confrontations between protesters and law enforcement officials that have occurred in this area. ” Mr. Archambault said in a statement that the tribe was “deeply disappointed” by the decision. “It is both unfortunate and disrespectful that this announcement comes the day after this country celebrates Thanksgiving  —   a historic exchange between Native Americans and the first immigrants from Europe,” he said. “Although the news is saddening, it is not all surprising given the last 500 years of mistreatment of our people. ” The authorities will close the area north of the Cannonball River, including the Oceti Sakowin camp, about 40 miles south of Bismarck, where opponents of the   Dakota Access Pipeline have gathered for months. Native American tribes, led by the Standing Rock Sioux, have been protesting the pipeline project. They fear it would pollute the Missouri River and harm sacred cultural lands and tribal burial grounds. There have been large protests at the Lake Oahe crossing the Missouri River is the tribe’s primary source of drinking water. Mr. Archambault said the best way to protect demonstrators during the winter and to reduce conflicts with the police “is to deny the easement for the Oahe crossing and deny it now. ” The letter from the district commander of the Army Corps, Col. John W. Henderson, said the emergency services and facilities needed to protect demonstrators camped north of the Cannonball River during the harsh North Dakota winters could not be provided. “I do not take this action lightly but have decided that it is required due to the concern for public safety and the fact that much of this land is leased to private persons for grazing   haying purposes as part of the corps’ land management practices,” he wrote. He said anyone found on the land after Dec. 5 could be charged with trespassing. The project has spurred months of clashes between the police and demonstrators. The most serious injury happened early Monday. An explosion during a protest badly damaged the left arm and hand of woman who grew up in the Bronx, Sophia Wilansky, 21. Her father, Wayne Wilansky, said that someone from the police lines had thrown a device he described as a grenade the police suggested that fellow demonstrators had caused the explosion, and said officers did not use concussion or flash grenades at any time. On Monday, the police confronted hundreds of protesters. Nearly 300 people were treated for injuries resulting from the use of police force, according to the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council. The pipeline project was delayed in September when the Obama administration temporarily blocked it from crossing under the Missouri River. President Obama called on both sides to show restraint and revealed that the Army Corps of Engineers was considering an alternative route for the project. But Kelcy Warren, chief executive of the pipeline company, Energy Transfer Partners, told The Associated Press it would not consider a different route. Though the project has been delayed by legal disputes, the pipeline is nearly complete."
"Brooks: Trump Has ’Incapacity for Empathy,’ ’Incapacity To Control His Own Attention’ - Breitbart","On Friday’s broadcast of “PBS NewsHour,” New York Times columnist David Brooks argued that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s statements over the last week aren’t errors, they show an “incapacity for empathy” and “an incapacity to control his own attention, and to say things that are just inappropriate for a politician or inappropriate for a human being. ”  Brooks stated, “I do think they’re not missteps in a way, because they’re not errors. They’re him. I do think we’ve seen  —   we have seen this all along from him, two things, one, incapacity for empathy. So, a normal person looks at Mrs. Khan and sees a woman in deep pain, and has an instinctual response of respect and admiration for what she’s endured, and sympathy, and you respond in a certain way. And  —   but he’s shown an incapacity for that for a long time. And then the second thing is, just an incapacity to control his own attention, and to say things that are just inappropriate for a politician or inappropriate for a human being. And so you get these trains of thought that go on where a word sparks off a thought, that sparks off a thought, that sparks off a thought, and it gives the impression of someone really not in control of their own attention span. And so, these are characterological. And I think that’s what sent the shivers through the Republican Party, and it’s become the subject of the debate this week, not did he make a mistake, but is this, in a sense, who he is?” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"
‘American Gods’ Features TV’s Most Explicit Gay Sex Scene Between Muslims,"Sunday night’s episode of Starz’s fantasy drama American Gods featured two Muslim men engaged in what many television critics and observers have called the most explicit gay sex scene in TV history. [[The story below contains graphic language.]    The third episode of American Gods, titled “The Secret of Snow,” saw Omani salesman Salim (Omid Abtahi) and The Jinn (Mousa Kraish) engaged in a nearly   sex scene complete with   male nudity and CGI semen. But according to showrunner Bryan Fuller, the scene required   because the first cut didn’t accurately capture the mechanics of gay sex. “I was like, ‘Okay, unless he has a     c*ck and can f*ck around corners, his d*ck’s not getting in him,” Fuller said of his reaction to the initial cut, according to Vulture. “So you guys need to go back and figure out where holes are. ” Based on Neil Gaiman’s acclaimed 2001 novel of the same name, American Gods follows an   widower named Shadow Moon (Ricky Whittle) who joins the enigmatic and mysterious Mr. Wednesday (Ian McShane) as they traverse a United States filled with ancient mythological gods at war with the   “New Gods. ” On writing the sex scene for his 2001   Gaiman says he found the process challenging as a straight man, having never before had gay sex. “I simply went, Okay, well, I’m about to be writing gay sex without ever having had gay sex, but I’ve read an awful lot of books by an awful lot of people, I think I can do this,” Gaiman told Vulture. The book’s description of the sex scene reads: “It is an hour or more before the ifrit comes, thrusting and grinding into Salim’s mouth. Salim has already come twice in this time. The jinn’s semen tastes strange, fiery, and it burns Salim’s throat. ” Having read those lewd lines, Fuller said “We felt like for Salim, as a man coming from a country that throws you off the top of buildings if you’re gay, a blow job in an alley is probably his only sexual experience,” Fuller said. “We felt like the djinn, in this romantic gesture, wanted to give him a more intimate sexual experience,” Fuller said of the mythical Islamic supernatural creature in the sex scene. “We wanted it to be incredibly visual and gorgeous. We wanted those things not to be lurid, but to be beautiful and captivating and for heterosexuals to watch the love scene between these two men and not go ‘Ew,’ but go, ‘That’s gorgeous. ’” Both Abtahi and Kraish, straight men who have known each other for a decade, said their friendship helped make the sex scene easier to shoot. “Omid’s a genuine,     human being, so that made it easier,” Kraish said. “I think that friendship helped a lot with our comfort zone and the connection aspect of it,” Abtahi added. The pair discussed boundaries and what wasn’t okay. “We kind of winged it,” Abthai said. “We kind of loosely talked about it, and as actors, you talk about your comfort zone and ‘This is what I’m comfortable with and within these parameters, I’ll give you 110 percent.’ Then the director would be like, ‘Action,’ and you would have four orgasms, expecting a cut after any one of those, and it just didn’t happen. ” “This felt like an action movie,” Kraish said. “We wanted it to be real and we both wanted it to be about two men who are in love with one another. ” Fuller told Vulture he was pleased with the way the scene ultimately turned out. “I hope there are Middle Eastern young men masturbating to that scene,” he said.

Obama Unlikely to Vow No First Use of Nuclear Weapons - The New York Times,"President Obama, who has weighed ruling out a first use of a nuclear weapon in a conflict, appears likely to abandon the proposal after top national security advisers argued that it could undermine allies and embolden Russia and China, according to several senior administration officials. Mr. Obama considers a reduction in the role of nuclear weapons as critical to his legacy. But he has been chagrined to hear critics, including some former senior aides, argue that the administration’s   nuclear modernization plans, costing up to $1 trillion in coming decades, undermine commitments he made in 2009. For months, arms control advocates have argued for a series of steps to advance the pledge he made to pursue “a world without nuclear weapons. ” An unequivocal    pledge would have been the boldest of those measures. They contend that as a practical matter no American president would use a nuclear weapon when so many other options are available. Former Defense Secretary William J. Perry said in a recent interview, “It’s the right time,” noting that the pledge would formalize what has been America’s unspoken policy for decades. But in the end, Mr. Obama seems to have sided with his current advisers, who warned in meetings culminating this summer that a    declaration would rattle allies like Japan and South Korea. Those nations are concerned about discussion of an American pullback from Asia prompted by comments made by the Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and Secretary of State John Kerry also expressed concern that new moves by Russia and China, from the Baltic to the South China Sea, made it the wrong time to issue the declaration, according to senior aides in the Defense and State Departments. Secretary of Energy Ernest J. Moniz, whose department oversees the nuclear arsenal, joined in the objections, administration officials confirmed. The New York Times interviewed more than a   administration officials involved in or briefed on the nuclear debate. All insisted on anonymity to describe internal administration deliberations on nuclear strategy. The United States dropped nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan at the end of World War II in 1945  —   the only example in history of a first use, or any use, of nuclear weapons in warfare. Almost every president since Harry S. Truman has made it clear that nuclear weapons would be used only as a last resort, so the pledge would have largely ratified unwritten policy. Administration officials confirmed that the question of changing the policy on first use had come up repeatedly this summer as a way for Mr. Obama to show that his commitment to reducing the role of nuclear weapons in American strategy  —   and thus the risk of nuclear exchanges  —   was more than rhetorical. But the arguments in front of the president himself were relatively brief, officials said, apparently because so many senior aides objected. Mr. Carter argued that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Kim   the North Korean leader, could interpret a promise of no first use as a sign of American weakness, even though that was not the intent. The defense secretary’s position was supported by Mr. Kerry and Mr. Moniz, two architects of the Iran nuclear deal, who cautioned that such a declaration could unnerve American allies already fearful that America’s nuclear umbrella cannot be relied upon. Mr. Trump talked explicitly in interviews about withdrawing military forces from Asia unless Tokyo and Seoul paid more for their presence, and said in March that he was willing to see them build their own nuclear arsenals rather than depend on Washington. According to one senior administration official, Mr. Kerry told Mr. Obama that a    pledge would also weaken the nuclear deterrent while Russia is running practice bombing runs over Europe and China is expanding its reach in the South China Sea. Mr. Obama and his national security team have rejected a second option: “ ” nuclear missiles ready to fire on short notice. The fear is that in a crisis, “ ” the weapons could escalate a conflict. Earlier, Mr. Obama and his aides also decided against eliminating one element of the “triad” of     and   weapons. The idea was to remove the missiles based in silos across the American West, which are considered outdated and vulnerable to a first strike. But the Pentagon argued strongly that the   missiles were the part of the system with which they had the most assured communications, and that it was too risky to get rid of them. In the past year, arms control advocates, including some of Mr. Obama’s former aides, have argued that Mr. Obama still has time to repair his reputation as an atomic visionary. “Let Obama be Obama,” Andrew C. Weber, an assistant secretary of defense for atomic programs from 2009 to 2014, said in an interview. Mr. Weber strongly opposes the White House’s recent approval of a nuclear cruise missile. “The defense complex is doing a   press, so things are going to be very hard to change,” he said. Mr. Obama’s favorite nuclear strategist in his first term, the retired vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. James E. Cartwright, wrote in a New York Times   article last month with Bruce G. Blair of Princeton University, a former Minuteman launch officer, that “nuclear weapons today no longer serve any purpose beyond deterring the first use of such weapons by our adversaries. ” “Our nonnuclear strength, including economic and diplomatic power, our alliances, our conventional and cyber weaponry and our technological advantages, constitute a global military juggernaut unmatched in history,” they concluded. Mr. Obama made the eventual elimination of nuclear arms a centerpiece of his 2008 presidential campaign. In contrast, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has said little this year about her nuclear plans, and Mr. Trump has argued for a major military buildup. Once Mr. Obama took office, his ambitions were frustrated. While he achieved a major arms control treaty, New Start, in 2010  —   driven through the Senate by Mr. Kerry  —   it came at a price: He won Republican votes by agreeing to a sweeping plan to modernize the American nuclear arsenal and build a new generation of weapon carriers, including bombers, missiles and submarines. In 2013, some of Mr. Obama’s former national security officials criticized the plan, saying his original vision was in danger of being turned on its head. The doubters included Philip E. Coyle III and Steve Fetter, who had recently left White House posts. One study estimated the modernization cost at $1 trillion over three decades. The Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington, released an analysis showing that Mr. Obama had dismantled fewer nuclear warheads than any other   War president. Inside the White House, Mr. Obama asked for new ideas to advance his agenda before leaving office. In May, he went to Hiroshima  —   the first American president to do so  —   and reaffirmed his vision of a nonnuclear world. “We must have the courage to escape the logic of fear,” he said at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial. “We may not realize this goal in my lifetime. But persistent effort can roll back the possibility of catastrophe. ” Ten days later, Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, outlined possible efforts in a speech to the Arms Control Association, a private group in Washington. His list included putting more nuclear material under tight security, reaffirming a global ban on nuclear testing and revisiting the administration’s plans to modernize the nuclear arsenal. It was an agenda sure to please his audience, but one that would largely fall to the next administration to execute. The president, Mr. Rhodes said, “will continue to review these plans as he considers how to hand the baton off to his successor. ” That review included the    pledge. Behind the scenes, Mr. Carter argued that a ban on first use would be unwise. If North Korea used biological weapons against the South, he and other Pentagon officials said, the United States might need the option of threatening a nuclear response. Mr. Kerry argued that Japan would be unnerved by any diminution of the American nuclear umbrella, and perhaps be tempted to obtain their own weapons. The same argument, he said, applied to South Korea. Mr. Kerry and Mr. Carter have not taken public positions in large part because they do not want to appear to influence Mr. Obama as he makes a decision. Had Mr. Obama issued the    declaration, officials conceded, the next president could have rejected it. In an interview this year, Mr. Trump bristled at the idea, saying he would never want to weaken America’s leverage. Mrs. Clinton has not spoken on the issue during her campaign. But a    policy would have been hard for either to undo. Military experts say the next president would hesitate to reverse such a decision since the quick reversal would confuse allies and possibly fray important coalitions."
The FBI asked the US State Department to stop investigating Hillary Clinton’s emails,"”WASHINGTON (Reuters)  —   The U. S. State Department has suspended an internal review of whether classified information was properly handled in former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s emails at the request of the FBI, a spokeswoman said on Friday.” ’Clinton, the   in the race for the Democratic Party nomination in the Nov. 8 presidential election, has apologized for using a private email server for official business while in office from 2009 to 2013 and said she did nothing wrong.

Betsy DeVos picked for education secretary," (CNN)  Donald Trump tapped Betsy DeVos, a top Republican donor and school choice activist, to head the Department of Education, the Trump transition team announced Wednesday. Trump met with the billionaire donor and conservative activist this weekend at his golf club in New Jersey, where he hosted a slew of potential Cabinet appointees. Trump offered DeVos the position on Tuesday and she accepted the same day, a senior Trump transition official told CNN. ”Betsy DeVos is a brilliant and passionate education advocate,” Trump said in a statement Wednesday. ”Under her leadership we will reform the US education system and break the bureaucracy that is holding our children back so that we can deliver   education and school choice to all families.” Teacher’s union slams DeVos, But Trump is also already drawing fire from both sides of the political spectrum for his pick. The largest teacher’s union in the country slammed DeVos within an hour of the announcement for her advocacy of charter schools and school voucher programs, while conservatives quickly pointed out DeVos’ association with groups supporting the Common Core education standards, which Trump has vowed to nix. DeVos moved quickly on Wednesday to quell any uproar on the right over her association with   Core groups, saying, ”I am not a supporter    period.” DeVos chairs the American Federation for Children, a group that promotes charter school education, and also served on the board of the Foundation for Excellence in Education, a group led by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush    one of Trump’s GOP primary opponents    which promoted both school choice and the Common Core education standards. And so while Trump vowed to eliminate Common Core, his pick of DeVos has begun to scare conservative opponents of the standards. DeVos insisted in the post on her website that she supports ”high standards, strong accountability and local control.” ”Have organizations that I have been a part of supported Common Core? Of course. But that’s not my position,” she wrote. As speculation swirled Tuesday that DeVos might snag the top education job, conservative opponents of Common Core began to warn Trump away from DeVos. Frank Cannon, the president of the adamantly   Core American Principles Project, said in a statement Tuesday that DeVos would be ”a very   pick” and called it ”puzzling” that Trump was considering DeVos for the post. ”He repeatedly assured parents across the heartland that he intended to return power over education to local schools,” Cannon said of Trump. ”It is puzzling, then, to see reports that the Trump transition team is considering an establishment,   Core Secretary of Education    this would not qualify as ’draining the swamp’    and it seems to fly in the face of what Trump has stated on education policy up to this point.” ’Status quo in education not acceptable’ After the pick was announced, the   news site Breitbart blared the headline: ”TRUMP ANNOUNCES   CORE EDUCATION SECRETARY”    noting the second apparent betrayal in as many days. The site also rebuked Trump’s announcement he no longer plans to push for prosecution of his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton as a ”broken promise.”  DeVos did not initially mention Common Core in a statement Wednesday, but said broadly that ”the status quo in education is not acceptable.” ”Together, we can work to make transformational change that ensures every student in America has the opportunity to fulfill his or her highest potential,” DeVos said in a statement. Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Sunday that Trump’s meeting with DeVos ”largely focused on Common Core, setting higher national standards” and ”promoting school choice across the nation.” Bush, for his part, praised Trump’s decision in a Facebook post, calling DeVos ”an outstanding pick.” ”Her allegiance is to families, particularly those struggling at the bottom of the economic ladder, not to an outdated public education model that has failed them from one generation to the next,” Bush wrote. ”I cannot think of more effective and passionate change agent to press for a new education vision, one in which students, rather than adults and bureaucracies, become the priority in our nation’s classrooms.” Accusations of ’  solutions to public education’ DeVos has been involved in Republican politics both as a donor and as a party official for decades and served as the state Republican Party chair in Michigan. The National Education Association, the largest labor union in the US, was quick to slam Trump’s pick, arguing that DeVos has ”done more to undermine public education than support students” and accusing her of pushing ”a corporate agenda.” ”She has lobbied for failed schemes, like vouchers  —   which take away funding and local control from our public schools  —   to fund private schools at taxpayers’ expense. These schemes do nothing to help our   students while they ignore or exacerbate glaring opportunity gaps. She has consistently pushed a corporate agenda to privatize,   and impose   solutions to public education,” the labor union representing teachers and school administrators said in a statement. ”By nominating Betsy DeVos, the Trump administration has demonstrated just how out of touch it is with what works best for students, parents, educators and communities.”"
Donald Trump’s News Session Starts War With and Within Media - The New York Times,"He deemed BuzzFeed News “a failing pile of garbage,” mocked an inquiry about his tax returns  —   “Gee, I’ve never heard that one before”  —   and, in an   moment for a presidential news conference, shouted down questions from a CNN reporter, declaring, with some menace, “Not you. ” “Your organization is terrible,” said   Donald J. Trump, his voice rising as Jim Acosta of CNN tried to interject. “No, I’m not going to give you a question. I’m not going to give you a question. ” “You,” the   said, as Mr. Acosta and other stunned journalists looked on, “are fake news. ” Any hope that Mr. Trump would temper his attacks on the news media after the campaign seemed to dissipate in the marble atrium of Trump Tower on Wednesday, as the   holding his first news conference since July, turned a controversy over his ties to Russia into a deft and unrelenting attack on the journalists who reported it. It was a spectacle that attracted nearly 300 reporters to Midtown Manhattan  —   the news conference was carried live in Australia, England and Germany  —   and it came against an extraordinary backdrop: reports that intelligence officials had briefed Mr. Trump on a document alleging collusion between the Russian government and his campaign. CNN broke the news on Tuesday but declined to publish specific allegations, saying its reporters could not verify them. BuzzFeed News published the unverified claims in full, a move that prompted an ethical debate in journalistic circles  —   and offered Mr. Trump an opening. “The fact that BuzzFeed and CNN made the decision to run with this unsubstantiated claim is a sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks,” the incoming White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said, inaccurately lumping the two news organizations together. But the result was classic Trump: Not only did he break the norms of presidential engagement with the news media, snubbing organizations because of an unflattering story, but he also had elements of a frustrated political press corps warring with one another. Immediately after the news conference, CNN defended its reporting and drew a sharp distinction between its news story and “BuzzFeed’s decision to publish unsubstantiated memos. ” On a broadcast, the CNN anchor Jake Tapper said that BuzzFeed’s move “hurts us all. ” “It’s irresponsible to put uncorroborated information on the internet,’’ Mr. Tapper said. “I can understand why   Trump would be upset about that I would be upset about it. too. ’’ Later, Chuck Todd, the NBC News moderator, repeatedly pressed BuzzFeed’s editor in chief, Ben Smith, on why unverified claims did not amount to “fake news. ” Mr. Smith, for his part, said he was “not going to participate in an attempt to divide the media against each other. ” (In a memo on Wednesday, BuzzFeed’s chief executive, Jonah H. Peretti, defended the move. “We are going to keep doing what we do best, which is deliver impactful journalism,” he wrote.) Still, by the time the news conference finished  —   with Omarosa Manigault, the “Apprentice” star and future member of the White House staff, heckling Mr. Acosta, shouting, “Cut it out!”  —   Mr. Trump had bobbed and weaved his way through nearly an hour of interrogation, offering vague answers to critical questions about his administration. Yet the conduct of the news media, a familiar foil from Mr. Trump’s campaign days, remained at the center of the day’s story. The treatment of Mr. Acosta raised alarms among news media advocates and his fellow journalists, particularly after Mr. Acosta described a threat by Mr. Spicer to eject him from the news conference when he persisted in trying to ask the   a question. Harsh words between reporters and press secretaries happen. But an anchor for a rival network, Shepard Smith of Fox News, later came to Mr. Acosta’s defense, saying that no “journalists should be subjected to belittling and delegitimizing by the   of the United States. ” The National Press Club also lamented Mr. Trump’s behavior, saying in a statement: “Presidents shouldn’t get to pick and choose which reporters’ questions they will answer based on what news outlet for which they work. ” Mr. Trump, who ultimately took one question from a CNN reporter, also called on journalists from two   organizations: BreitbartNews and One America News. Matthew Boyle, the Breitbart reporter, asked the   for his ideas on how to reform the news media. Mostly, however, Mr. Trump took questions from journalists at the major television networks, with John Roberts of Fox News going first. A Greek chorus of sorts  —   mostly Trump supporters and aides, including Ms. Manigault  —   watched from the side, applauding Mr. Trump and jeering questions from reporters they deemed unpleasant. A man who prides himself on finding an opponent’s weakness, Mr. Trump at one point zeroed in on an existential question that has lingered in many newsrooms since his surprise victory: How much does the traditional news media still matter in a polarized age? When Hallie Jackson, an NBC News correspondent, asked the   if he would finally release his tax returns, to verify his claim that he has no financial dealings in Russia, Mr. Trump scoffed. “You know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, O. K.?” the   said. “They’re the only ones who ask. ” “You don’t think the American public is concerned about it?” Ms. Jackson asked. “I don’t think so,” Mr. Trump replied, before laying down the political equivalent of a  : ”I won. ”"
Germany’s Populists Beat Merkel’s Migrant CDU Party: Exit Polls,"Exit polls from Germany suggest the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party have beaten Angela Merkel’s CDU in her home state, one year after she opened Germany’s borders to unlimited migration. [The AfD is seen as the nationalist, populist,   migration party of the country which has undergone drastic changes, internal splits, and widespread “controversy” over the past few years.  The victory in Mrs. Merkel’s home state will pour cold water on her thoughts of running for another term as Germany Chancellor. 17:00 BST  —   Polling stations are closed and ballot counting begins, Voting for the regional elections in the northern German region of   ended at 6pm local time. Early exit polls suggest that Alternative for Germany (AfD) are in second place behind the ruling Socialists with 21 per cent of the vote. The party of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) has suffered  a major setback losing several percentage points since the last election in 2011 heading down to third place. While the Socialists are in a commanding lead with 30 per cent of the vote, the party lost much support from its traditional working class base. Both the AfD and the Socialists took 28 per cent of the working vote due to many working people being directly impacted by the effects of mass migration. Across the board, all major establishment parties lost percentage points compared to the election in 2011 with the AfD at +21 per cent, and the liberal FDP gaining a mere 0. 2 per cent. Ballots are currently being counted and a final result is expected in the coming hours. ORIGINAL STORY FOLLOWS: BERLIN, Sept 4 (Reuters)  —   Voting began on Sunday in the German state of   where polls project the   Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party will make huge gains amid growing discontent with Chancellor Angela Merkel and her   refugee policy. The election, taking place exactly a year after Merkel’s decision to open Germany’s borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees, will be followed by another key vote in Berlin in two weeks and national elections next September. Voters already punished Merkel in three state elections in March, voting in droves for the AfD and rejecting Merkel’s Christian Democrats.   is a small coastal state in northeastern Germany with just 1. 3 million eligible voters, but losses there would be humiliating for Merkel, who has her own electoral district in the state. The AfD, founded two years after the last election in the state, is expected to capture 22 percent of the vote, the same as Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) junior partner in the state’s ruling coalition, according to a poll by broadcaster ZDF. The Social Democrats, senior partners in the state’s ruling coalition, are expected to win 28 percent of the vote, compared with 35. 6 percent in the last   election in 2011. The AfD is also making gains nationwide, a new poll showed Sunday. If the national election were held next week, The AfD would win 12 percent of the vote, making it the   party in Germany, according to a poll conducted by the Emnid institute for the Bild newspaper and published on Sunday. That would catapult the party into the German parliament for the first time since its creation in 2013. Merkel, mulling a bid for a fourth term as chancellor, made a   campaign appearance on Saturday in   warning against the politics of “angst” offered by AfD with its virulent   stance. “Every vote counts,” she said. “This election is about the future of this state. ” She urged voters to look beyond divisive campaign slogans and consider the policies of the current coalition that had halved unemployment and pumped up tourism in the northeastern coastal state. In an interview in the   Bild newspaper, Merkel defended her decision to welcome so many migrants fleeing conflict in the Middle East, and denied the influx had cut funding for the German public. Merkel’s approval ratings have sunk to a   low of 45 percent over the past year, but the chancellor said she would act no differently if faced with the same situation today. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere, a fellow Christian Democrat, rejected criticism from some in the CDU’s Christian Social Union (CSU) sister party that Merkel’s refugee policy was responsible for the rise of the AfD party. The Emnid poll said 63 percent of Germans believed that too. “I consider that preposterous,” he told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper. “The refugee crisis is not the reason that   populist parties are now making gains here. That has more to do with the anxiety that some have about globalisation and modernity. ” (By Andrea Shalal Editing by Greg Mahlich and Mark Potter)"
EXCLUSIVE – Gay Porn Kingpin Takes on LGBT Boycott Israel Movement,"TEL AVIV  —   The boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement targeting Israel is nothing more than old fashioned   disguised as political activism, Michael Lucas, a gay pornographic film actor and director, declared in a radio interview on Sunday. [Lucas is founder and CEO of Lucas Entertainment, New York’s largest gay adult film company and one of the biggest gay porn production companies in the world.  The BDS movement is “all about political correctness but basically it’s all about good old Jew hatred,” he said. “It’s all about  . They hate Jews. Now we have a new word: Israel. It’s really considered after the Holocaust to be very inappropriate and low class to say, ‘We hate Jews.’ So they say, ‘You know, we disagree with the Zionist policies. Israel get out from the West Bank. Get out from Palestine.’ Why the hell and how dare the world tell Israel that Jews should leave Palestine, that Jews should leave the West Bank. ” Lucas made the comments on “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” the popular Sunday night   program broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and Philadelphia’s NewsTalk 990 AM. Klein doubles as Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter. Lucas was speaking after over 200 rowdy BDS protesters stormed the gay rights Creating Change Conference at the Chicago Hilton on Friday and used intimidation tactics to cancel an event hosted by A Wider Bridge, an organization that advocates the relationship between the “LGBTQ communities of North America and Israel. ” The National LGBTQ Task Force, which organized the conference, had weeks earlier cancelled the Wider Bridge reception but reinstated it last week after pressure from major Jewish organizations, including the   League. Listen to Part 1 of Klein’s interview with Lucus below: Lucas told Klein he suggested that A Wider Bridge sue the National LGBTQ Task Force and even offered to pay for the case. He said the organization told him they did not want to take the legal route. “I believe that apologies are never enough,” he said of the Taskforce’s actions. “You have to set a precedent where other organizations, whether gay or straight, have to know that you cannot just scare the Jews. You will have consequences. ” Klein pointed out Israel is the only country in the Middle East where gays have full democratic rights and can live freely and openly. He asked Lucas to explain why some gay rights groups ignore the rampant institutionalized persecution of LGBT in surrounding nations while singling out Israel, which actually serves as a sanctuary for Palestinian and Arab LGBT. Lucas replied: It’s not like gays are better than anyone else. Gays are as   as straight people. And also gay people are on the left and the left is confused. The left believes that the Palestinians are the underdogs. The world is all upside down. Everything is up on its head. It’s this huge confusion. People don’t like Israel because no one wants to see Jews able to defend themselves. They want to see Jews being defenseless and at the mercy of a hosting country  …     We Jews gave the world more and Israel gave the world much more than any nation  . So I believe that we are great. But even if it were the case that Jews were not the best they are bad. Fine. Israel was not the best it’s bad. Fine. But disproportionally to Saudi Arabia? To Iran? Listen to Part 2 of Klein’s interview with Lucus below: Israel is “losing the fight in the U. S.,” Lucas warned.  “Those   groups are successfully convincing Democrats and liberals that Palestinians are the underdogs. And people usually don’t think for themselves. ” Lucas has been a staunch supporter of the Jewish state, writing opinion pieces targeting Israel’s critics in such publications as The Advocate, Huffington Post and Pink News.  He also released a gay porn film titled “Men of Israel,” which was reportedly the first such film shot on location in Israel and using an all Israeli and all Jewish cast.  Lucas called the film “a bold move to promote Israeli culture and tourism. ” Writing in Out Magazine last week, Lucas slammed the   protesters at Friday’s LGBTQ event in Chicago as “thugs” who were “not interested in dialogue. They comprised an enraged gang filled with   bent on intimidating and silencing LGBT Jews who have any connection to the state of Israel. ” His Israel advocacy has not been without consequence, however. Lucas says   protesters follow him to speeches at universities and stalk him at public events in the porn industry. “In the gay world I have made lots of people hate me,” he told Klein. “There were a lot of calls from the gay community overall to boycott my films. That was funny. Good luck. ” Lucas slammed his critics as uneducated, explaining they are misusing the word “racism. ” He stated: People accuse you of racism because you speak for Israel.  That’s not actually racism. Palestinians and Muslims are not a race. Such a terrible use of the English language. Speaking for Israel does not make you more popular. It gives you accusations of racism. Of Islamophobia  —   whatever that means. And you become politically incorrect. It’s all about political correctness but basically it’ all about good old Jew hatred. It’s all about  . The Algemeiner   news website documented the scene at Friday’s LGBTQ event: Reportedly chanting “no justice, no peace,” protesters displayed signs equating the Jewish state with apartheid and Zionism with racism, targeting a reception featuring Israeli LGBT rights activists Sarah   and Tom Canning of the Jerusalem Open House for Pride and Tolerance, an Israeli LGBT advocacy group. “There were about 200 protesters outside the room. They blockaded the room, three of them entered the room, took over the stage, and the people from Jerusalem Open House were not allowed to speak,” explained Adrian Shanker, Executive Director of the Allentown,     LGBT Community Center. “They [  and Canning] were escorted out of the room so they would be safe, and we were all asked to leave through the service entrance for our safety. ” A group of 90 gay rights activists last week issued a letter calling the conference shutdown incident “dangerous, deeply disturbing, and given the use of epithets like ‘kike,’ clearly  . ” The activists urged the National LGBTQ Task Force to have an “outside, independent party” review the events at the conference to determine how it occurred and make recommendations to “ensure that it will not happen again. ” The incident was caught on video.

Scotland Embraces Gay Politicians in a Profound Cultural Shift - The New York Times,"GLASGOW  —   A popular tabloid called Patrick Harvie, the leader of the Scottish Green Party, a “Green threat to the family” when he ran for Parliament in 2003  —   not because of his politics but because he is bisexual. When Ruth Davidson became the first openly gay leader of the Scottish Conservative Party in 2011, she was labeled the “kickboxing lesbian. ” By the time Kezia Dugdale, the leader of the Scottish Labour Party, came out in April, it was hardly considered news at all. In the span of a generation, Scotland has shed much of its traditional social conservatism and enthusiastically embraced diversity in sexuality, a process led and reinforced by a remarkable transformation in its political culture. Homosexuality was illegal in Scotland until 1980  —   in England it was decriminalized in 1967  —   and as recently as 2000, billboards financed by a Christian millionaire campaigning to uphold a ban on schools’ talking about homosexuality urged Scots to “Protect Our Children. ” Today, in addition to the leaders of three of the five major political parties in Scotland, four ministers in the Scottish government are openly gay, as is the secretary of state for Scotland in Britain’s Conservative government. The one elected representative of the   U. K. Independence Party in Scotland is gay, too. Of the 129 members of the Scottish Parliament, a legislative assembly with   autonomy from London, 10, or nearly 8 percent, identify as gay, lesbian or bisexual, by one tally the highest known proportion for a national legislature anywhere. “Scotland has the gayest Parliament in the world,” said Andrew Reynolds, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who keeps track of the political representation of those who identify publicly as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, or L. G. B. T. across the world. By contrast, the United States Congress, representing a population 60 times Scotland’s, has six elected House members and one senator who are openly gay, lesbian or bisexual. Scotland’s transformation is emblematic of change in many Western countries. On Thursday, the British government announced that it would posthumously pardon thousands of men once convicted of having or seeking gay sex. (The 1885 Criminal Law Amendment Act, which made homosexuality illegal, did not mention women  —   some say to avoid giving them any ideas.) But the shift in Scotland has also reflected trends closer to home. Scotland’s Parliament is young. Established in 1999 as part of a deal to devolve more power from London, it has given a platform to a new generation that grew up with greater tolerance about sexuality has made politicians, because they are in Edinburgh, more accessible to interest groups like L. G. B. T. advocates and has injected new energy and pride into Scottish politics. In turn, the openly gay politicians who have emerged since then have helped champion L. G. B. T. rights. “It’s a big cultural shift,” said Ms. Dugdale, who became engaged to her girlfriend this summer. “When you say you’re gay, people just shrug their shoulders. There is almost a feeling of ‘so what? ’” Scotland has long voted to the ideological left of England. It was a stronghold of the Labour Party before Scottish voters switched to the even more   Scottish National Party, now the dominant political force. But a mix of Calvinism and Catholicism meant that on issues like abortion, divorce and homosexuality, Scotland remained more conservative than England for decades. The Scottish nationalists were once known as the “Tartan Tories. ” Now they are the   party in the British Parliament in London, and eight of their 56 members of Parliament are openly gay, bisexual or lesbian, a higher proportion than in the other main parties. “I’m very proud to be the leader of the gayest parliamentary group in the world,” Angus Robertson, the (straight) deputy leader of the Scottish National Party, declared this month. His campaign manager, Nathan Sparling, regularly performs in drag at    one of London’s   gay clubs. At the party’s annual conference in Glasgow this month, Mr. Sparling hosted a karaoke night dressed up as his alter ego, Nancy Clench. Ms. Davidson of the Scottish Conservatives, a churchgoing Presbyterian who trained for Britain’s Army Reserve and once cheerfully described herself as a “    lesbian,” cut her hair shorter than it had ever been when she first ran for office. “I wanted to make sure people knew what they were getting,” she said. Since then, five other Scottish Conservative Party politicians have come out, her partner has appeared with her in campaign broadcasts, and her party overtook the Labour Party as the main opposition party in Scotland for the first time. The church she attends flies a rainbow flag on its communion table. “We’ve come a very, very long way in a really short time,” she said. There is still more to do, Ms. Davidson and others said. Bullying in schools remains a problem, particularly for transgender teenagers. Hate crimes against L. G. B. T. people are up by 20 percent over the past year, according to Stonewall Scotland, an L. G. B. T. advocacy group, although that also reflects the fact that reporting rates have increased. But the changes in politics, policy and culture have been striking. One of the first things lawmakers did after the creation of the Scottish Parliament in 1999 was to repeal legislation barring schools from “promoting homosexuality,” a law that had effectively muffled any discussion of L. G. B. T. issues in schools. It was an ugly fight, with homophobic slogans splashed across front pages and billboards as parts of the national press teamed up with the Roman Catholic church and Brian Souter, a wealthy Scottish businessman, to fight the repeal. But in the end, they lost. “It was the last gasp of conservative Scotland,” said David Torrance, an author and journalist, who is a respected political commentator and also gay. Since then, Scotland has legalized civil partnerships, gay adoption and, in 2014,   marriage (known in Scotland as “equal marriage” because it allows for entirely   ceremonies). Scottish   law, which explicitly includes prejudice against transgender and intersex people, is considered one of the most robust in the world. And now the government is considering changing its gender recognition law to accommodate those with a “nonbinary” identity, which is neither female nor male. “It’s extraordinary: We have started a conversation about a genderless society,” said Bob Orr, 66, who in 1982   Edinburgh’s first lesbian and gay bookshop, Lavender Menace. That bookshop closed years ago, as have several gay bars. Gay people increasingly go to mainstream places, Mr. Orr said, and several singers in his “L. G. B. T. choir” are straight. “The boundaries are going,” he said. “And that was always the point  —   that sexuality ceases to matter. ” Indeed, one of Scotland’s most prominent gay rights campaigners is straight: Liam Stevenson, a    truck driver with a shaved head and soccer tattoo, led this year’s Pride Parade in Glasgow for Time for Inclusive Education, a campaign for L. G. B. T.  education that he founded with a gay student. When their Parliament was created, 48 percent of Scots thought   relationships were always or mostly wrong, according to the government’s social attitudes survey. That share dropped to 18 percent in the most recent survey, published this month. When Scotland hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2014, the opening ceremony featured the   actor John Barrowman kissing a male dancer. This “tartan kiss” was “Scotland telling the world who we are,” Mr. Torrance said. And the world is beginning to take note. Andrew Brown, a gay wedding planner in Glasgow, said more gay couples from abroad were coming to Scotland to get married. It helps that the paperwork is so simple: “Scotland is a bit like Vegas,” said Mr. Brown, who has recently organized weddings for Chinese, Italian and Canadian couples. A few years ago, he and his husband, Scott, were considering moving to Sydney, Australia. But they have decided to stay. Val McDermid, a Scottish crime writer, moved to England in 1979, when, she said, in Scotland “just meeting other lesbians took more planning and luck than climbing Ben Nevis,” Scotland’s highest mountain. She returned two years ago. “The country that I have come back to is not the country I left,” Ms. McDermid wrote this year. “This is now a place where you can be glad to be gay because it’s O. K. to be gay. ”"
Sean Spicer Responds to Dem Lawmakers Boycotting Trump Inauguration: ’It’s a Shame’ - Breitbart,"A growing list of roughly 50 Democratic lawmakers say they will not attend   Donald Trump’s inauguration on Friday. [According to the Washington Post, at least 49 Democratic members of the U. S. House of Representatives are boycotting Trump’s inauguration “to protest what they described as his alarming and divisive policies, foreign interference in his election and his criticism of civil rights icon John Lewis, a congressman from Georgia. ”  Lewis told NBC News that he was not planning to attend Trump’s inauguration because he doesn’t see Trump’s election victory as legitimate due to attempted interference in the U. S. election by Russia. Trump’s spokesman Sean Spicer responded to the planned boycott during a call with reporters on Tuesday morning. “We’d love for every member of Congress to attend but if they don’t, we’ve got some great seats for others to partake in,” Spicer stated. “It’s a shame that these folks don’t want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power. ”"
Andy McCarthy: Trump is a Thinned Skinned Tyrant - Breitbart,"From Andy McCarthy in National Review:  Is Donald Trump the sharia of American politics? I’m having trouble finding much daylight between Islamic law’s repressive blasphemy standards and the mogul’s   sense of privilege. None of us wants to be insulted or smeared. But sharia forbids not only ridicule or slander against Islam it bans any examination that casts Islam in an unflattering light. Worse, truth is not a defense: Even if one’s questions are based on undeniable past actions or verbatim quotes from scripture, tough questioning is considered blasphemous. Retribution, moreover, is often completely out of proportion to the scale of the perceived “offense. ” How is Trump different? Read the rest of the article here."
"Kerry Rebukes Israel, Calling Settlements a Threat to Peace - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Secretary of State John Kerry accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Wednesday of thwarting peace in the Middle East, speaking with a clarity and harshness almost never heard from American diplomats when discussing one of their closest and strongest allies. With only 23 days left in his   turn as secretary of state, during which he made the search for peace in the Middle East one of his driving missions, Mr. Kerry said the Israeli government was undermining any hope of a   solution to its   conflict with the Palestinians. The American vote last week in the United Nations allowing the condemnation of Israel for settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, he added, was driven by a desire to save Israel from “the most extreme elements” in its own government. “The status quo is leading toward one state and perpetual occupation,” Mr. Kerry said, his voice animated. His speech was a powerful admonition after years of tension and frustration, with the Obama administration giving public voice to its   concern that Israel was headed off a cliff toward international isolation and was condemning itself to a future of   perpetual warfare with the Palestinians. Reaction was immediate and harsh, not only from Mr. Netanyahu, but also from Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York.   Donald J. Trump did not even wait for Mr. Kerry to speak before condemning the secretary of state. The United States and Israel are in the middle of a breach rarely seen since President Harry S. Truman recognized the fragile Israeli state in May 1948. In a direct response to Mr. Netanyahu’s barb over the weekend that “friends don’t take friends to the Security Council”  —   a reference to the Obama administration’s decision to abstain from the resolution condemning the building of new settlements in disputed territory  —   Mr. Kerry said the United States acted out of a deeper understanding of the meaning of its alliance. “Some seem to believe that the U. S. friendship means the U. S. must accept any policy, regardless of our own interests, our own positions, our own words, our own principles  —   even after urging again and again that the policy must change,” he said. “Friends need to tell each other the hard truths, and friendships require mutual respect. ” Toward the end of his   speech in the State Department’s auditorium, Mr. Kerry acknowledged that Mr. Trump may well abandon the major principles that the United States has used for decades of Middle East negotiations, including the   solution that both Republicans and Democrats support. Mr. Trump is nominating a new American ambassador, David M. Friedman, who has broken with even the pretense of supporting a   negotiated agreement and has helped fund some of the settlements Mr. Kerry denounced. On vacation in Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Trump posted two Twitter messages rejecting the speech before it was delivered. “We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect,” he wrote on Wednesday morning. After assailing the nuclear deal in Iran and last week’s vote at the Security Council, he said, “Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!” He was soon praised  —   also on Twitter  —   by Mr. Netanyahu, who later released a video statement that was unsparingly direct and dismissive of Mr. Kerry. “The entire Middle East is going up in flames, entire countries are toppling, terrorism is raging and for an entire hour the secretary of state attacks the only democracy in the Middle East,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “Maybe Kerry did not notice that Israel is the only place in the Middle East where Christmas can be celebrated in peace and security. Sadly, none of this interests the secretary of state. ” Mr. Kerry’s speech was criticized at home as well. Mr. McCain called it a “pointless tirade,” while Mr. Schumer, the incoming Senate Democratic leader, said he feared that Mr. Kerry had “emboldened extremists on both sides. ” Mr. Kerry did make note of the Palestinian violence, the “extremist agenda” of Hamas, and the Palestinian unwillingness to recognize Israel. All, he said, were at the heart of the conflict. But Mr. Netanyahu’s continued support of settlements, “strategically placed in locations that make two states impossible,” he said, is driving a solution further and further away. Mr. Kerry argued that Israel, with a growing Arab population, could not survive as both a Jewish state and a democratic state unless it embraced the   approach that a succession of American presidents have endorsed. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, responded to Mr. Kerry’s speech by calling on Israel to freeze housing construction in order to restart negotiations. “The minute the Israeli government agrees to cease all settlement activities, including in and around occupied East Jerusalem, and agree to implement the signed agreements on the basis of mutual reciprocity, the Palestinian leadership stands ready to resume permanent status negotiations,” he said. Mr. Netanyahu has said he is willing to meet Mr. Abbas anytime for talks as long as there are no preconditions. It was notable that it was Mr. Kerry who delivered the speech rather than President Obama, who has long kept a distance from Middle East peace negotiations, a pursuit he has always doubted would succeed. After talks at Camp David collapsed in 2000, it was President Bill Clinton himself who gave a speech laying out the parameters of an ultimate deal, about 10 days before leaving office in 2001. At the time, Mr. Clinton also censured Israel for its settlements, but in far more measured terms. Mr. Kerry called them a violation of international law, a position he said the State Department had taken since 1978. “The Israeli prime minister publicly supports a   solution, but his current coalition is the most   in Israeli history, with an agenda driven by its most extreme elements,” he said. “The result is that policies of this government  —   which the prime minister himself just described as ‘more committed to settlements than any in Israel’s history’  —   are leading in the opposite direction, towards one state. ” Seldom in modern American diplomacy has an American administration so directly confronted  —   and disavowed  —   a close ally’s actions as Mr. Kerry did on Wednesday, dropping most of the restraint he had shown in public over the past four years. One of the last times was during the Eisenhower administration, when the United States broke with Britain, France and Israel over the 1956 invasion of the Egyptian Sinai. Eisenhower had warned against the invasion and threatened to harm Britain’s financial system in retaliation. When Mr. Kerry got to the principles for a future settlement, they were unsurprising. Many date to the 1990s or earlier, and many to past United Nations resolutions. The principles he described started with a “secure and recognized border between Israel and a viable and contiguous Palestine,” based on Israel’s withdrawal from territory occupied since the 1967 war and land swaps to “reflect practical realities on the ground. ” A second principle was the creation of a state for the Palestinian people, and a third was a “fair and realistic solution to the Palestinian refugee issue,” including compensation. There was no mention of a “right of return” for refugees and their descendants forced to leave Israel and the Palestinian territories, back to 1948. The fourth principle called for Jerusalem to be the recognized capital of both states, which Mr. Kerry said was “the most sensitive issue for both sides. ” The fifth was an agreement to satisfy Israel’s security needs while ending its military occupation of Palestinian territories. Mr. Kerry, who has cast himself as one of Israel’s greatest friends, said in recent months it became clear he had to “save the   solution while there was still time. ” “We did not take this decision lightly,” he said of the vote in the United Nations Security Council, where the American abstention allowed a    condemnation of Israel go forward. “Israelis are fully justified in decrying attempts to delegitimize their state and question the right of a Jewish state to exist. But this vote was not about that. It was about actions that Israelis and Palestinians are taking that are increasingly rendering a   solution impossible. ” It was also about Mr. Kerry’s own personal disappointment. As soon as he took over from Hillary Clinton as secretary of state in 2013, Mr. Kerry plunged into the tar pit of Middle East peace negotiations with an enthusiasm neither Mrs. Clinton nor Mr. Obama shared. The goal was a   negotiation leading to a “final status” of the   conflict by the summer of 2014. It never got that far. Despite scores of meetings between Mr. Kerry and his two main interlocutors, Mr. Abbas, the Palestinian president, and Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Kerry and his lead mediators, Martin S. Indyk and Frank Lowenstein, could not make progress. They blamed both sides for taking actions that undermined the process, but the continued expansion of the settlements was one of their leading complaints  —   an effort, in the American and European view, to establish “facts on the ground” so that territory could not be traded away. Mr. Netanyahu has accused the United States of “orchestrating” the vote, and his aides have said that Mr. Kerry and Mr. Obama effectively stabbed Israel in the back. Israeli officials have said they have evidence that the United States organized the resolution. Mr. Kerry pushed back at that narrative on Wednesday. Mr. Netanyahu, for his part, is biding his time and waiting for Mr. Kerry and Mr. Obama to move on. Israeli leaders postponed plans on Wednesday to move ahead with new housing in East Jerusalem, just hours before the speech."
Obama Administration Intends to Transfer 17 or 18 Guantánamo Detainees - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   When Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy visited the White House in October for a state dinner, he made a commitment to President Obama: Italy, which resettled a Yemeni detainee from Guantánamo Bay last summer, would take one more person on the transfer list. But before the deal was completed, Mr. Renzi resigned. So a day after his successor, Paolo Gentiloni, formed a government on Dec. 14, Secretary of State John Kerry called to congratulate Mr. Gentiloni  —   and to urge him to follow through on the commitment, according to an official familiar with the negotiations. Mr. Gentiloni agreed, leading a rush to finalize the details and paperwork. The effort was part of a burst of urgent,   diplomatic talks aimed at moving as many as possible of Guantánamo’s 22 prisoners who are recommended for transfer. By law, the Pentagon must notify Congress 30 days before a transfer, so the deadline to set in motion deals before the end of the Obama administration was Monday. By late in the day, officials said, the administration had agreed to tell Congress that it intended to transfer 17 or 18 of the 59 remaining detainees at the prison they would go to Italy, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. If all goes as planned, that will leave 41 or 42 prisoners in Guantánamo for Donald J. Trump’s administration. Mr. Trump has vowed to keep the prison operating and “load it up with some bad dudes. ” Obama administration officials agreed to speak about the transfers on the condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatic talks and congressional notifications that are not public. Elisa Massimino, the president of Human Rights First, said that even though it appears likely that failing to fulfill his vow to close the Guantánamo prison will be part of Mr. Obama’s legacy, it was still “incredibly important” that his administration did not let up on the effort to get out those men who were deemed transferable, if security conditions could be met, after a   review. “In terms of gradations of immorality, holding people for years who we have no national security interest in detaining is unconscionable,” she said. “This is not just about a campaign promise. ” The Bush administration brought about 780 men to Guantánamo after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, saying that it could hold Qaeda suspects there in indefinite wartime detention without trial  —   a move that the Supreme Court eventually approved  —   and that it could disregard the Geneva Conventions in how it treated them, which the court rejected. President George W. Bush started trying to close the prison in his second term and bequeathed 242 detainees to Mr. Obama. If the proposed transfers go through, the 41 or 42 prisoners Mr. Trump would inherit include 10 men who were charged or convicted in the military commissions and 27 who have not been charged but are deemed too dangerous to release. The latter group includes a few people accused of links to significant attacks, like the 2002 nightclub bombings in Bali, Indonesia, but for whom   evidence is thin, and others who are not linked to any attack but who, officials believe, remain committed to Islamist militancy. That would leave the last four or five men on the transfer list. They include an Algerian, a Moroccan and a Tunisian whom the administration was reluctant to repatriate for reasons having to do with their home countries, officials said, and a stateless Rohingya man whom no country offered a home. All have been imprisoned for nearly 15 years. While a   board put the first two on the transfer list only recently, a 2009 task force had put the latter two on the transfer list seven years ago. Their fates are now uncertain. It is not clear whether Mr. Trump will refuse to transfer any remaining detainees  —   a step many Republicans denounced whenever Mr. Obama did it  —   or continue to use the   review boards that periodically consider moving detainees onto the transfer list. Obama officials credit that review process for a drop in the recidivism rate among former detainees. Of   transfers, 35 percent are confirmed or suspected of   in militancy of   transfers, the combined figure is 12 percent, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Matthew G. Olsen, the former National Counterterrorism Center director who led the task force in 2009 that initially reviewed and recommended what to do with each of the   detainees, said nearly eliminating the transfer list was a major accomplishment. “There is a humanitarian imperative not to detain people who can be safely transferred to their home country or to another country, and much of what we have seen over the past few years has been continued detention for many such people,” he said. Most who would be transferred next month are Yemenis. Because conditions in Yemen are chaotic, the Bush and the Obama administrations were reluctant to repatriate Yemeni detainees, so they stayed behind as others from more stable countries went home. The Obama administration did not try to resettle them in its first term, hoping Yemen would stabilize. It finally gave up and began resettling Yemenis in late 2014. The final push, according to officials familiar with internal deliberations, traces back to May 14, 2015, when Mr. Obama met at Camp David with leaders of the six Gulf Cooperation Council nations  —   including Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates  —   and obtained political commitments to help resettle Yemeni detainees. At the time, there were 57 men on the transfer list, about 49 of whom were Yemenis. Then, that July, several events helped set the conditions to turn such talk into transfers. First, the administration appointed Lee Wolosky to fill the vacancy as the State Department special envoy for Guantánamo closure, a role that had been open for six months his Pentagon counterpart was Paul Lewis. Then, Mr. Wolosky met with Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser, and they developed a plan to speed up the process by imposing a   deadline on the Pentagon to act on any proposal. Under law, the secretary of defense must approve any transfer both Chuck Hagel, the former secretary, and Ashton B. Carter, who took over in early 2015, went through periods when they were slow to act. Later that month, at a National Security Council Principals Committee meeting, the White House presented Mr. Carter with a memo imposing the deadline. According to several witnesses, he reacted angrily. But the Pentagon soon began moving more swiftly, including by starting its review of proposals without waiting for other agencies to sign off first, officials said. At the time, Mr. Kerry was in Europe completing the Iran nuclear deal. After he returned, he called Mr. Wolosky into his office and they agreed to make sustained diplomatic engagement on transfers a priority. Mr. Wolosky also obtained the authority to offer assistance to defray resettlement during negotiations, in the range of $100, 000, out of a Pentagon contingency fund without waiting for permission, officials said. Those events set the stage for the final push. Some detainees went to Europe, but the largest batches went to the Gulf nations, which the administration  —   attracted by the idea of sending Yemenis to a place with a shared language and capable internal security agencies  —   repeatedly asked for more help. In an interview, Mr. Wolosky said that even if Mr. Trump fills the prison back up, he does not consider his efforts to have been in vain “because detainees are not fungible. ” “Looking at these cases on an individualized basis was the right thing to do legally and morally,” he said. “A number of detainees the United States government unanimously decided years ago it no longer needed to detain were finally and responsibly released from U. S. custody. That is irreversible, regardless of what policy the next administration pursues. ”"
Four-year-old falls out of moving bus," (CNN) It’s a scene that would make any parent shudder    a    girl tumbles out of the back of a moving bus in the middle of a busy highway.  Video of the incident shows the back door of the bus springing open and the young girl plummeting to the road. ”I couldn’t believe it, it was so shocking,” said Ryan Ciampoli, who was driving behind the bus in Harrison, Arkansas. Ciampoli, who is a trained emergency medical technician, ran to the little girl’s rescue after her terrifying tumble on Wednesday. His vehicle is fitted with a dash cam that recorded the incident because he sometimes uses it when on duty, Ciampoli said. At first the girl was unconscious, but he cradled her and talked to her until she came round. ”For a very brief time she had got enough consciousness to say ’where is my mommy? ,’” he said. He picked her off the hot pavement and moved her off the busy road while waiting on emergency medical services. ”Obviously you want to leave her laying there, if she’s not in danger, but we’re in the middle of a state highway,” he told CNN affiliate  . ”So I couldn’t leave her just laying there.” The little girl is recovering at the hospital. She suffered a broken jaw and will undergo surgery. It is unclear if she opened the door or if it wasn’t locked. CNN has reached out to police for comment but they weren’t immediately available Sunday."

Trump’s Protectionist Economic Plan Is Nothing New,"In a way,   Donald Trump sees the world the way America’s Founding Fathers did. Like Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, Trump wants to protect American manufacturers by taxing products made overseas and sold in the United States. Alexander Hamilton, the country’s first treasury secretary, wrote to Congress in 1791 in his Report on Manufactures, that “by enhancing the charges on foreign articles, they enable the national manufacturers to undersell all their foreign competitors. ” Trump, taking a similar view, said he would slap a 45 percent tariff on imports from China, and a 35 percent tariff on all products that American companies make abroad and try to sell here. “Please be forewarned before making a very expensive mistake!” Trump tweeted last month at American companies considering relocating their factories abroad. As Trump makes his final picks for positions that will shape the country’s trade policies, it’s clear that he hopes to return the United States to its protectionist past. But the thing is, of course, that the American economy today is far different from Hamilton’s America, which was engaged in a trade war with Britain. Back then, the United States was trying to free itself from a colonial economic relationship with the British monarchy, in which British industries wanted to exploit America’s raw materials, untaxed. The Founding Fathers wanted to encourage their own emerging manufacturing industry, and raising import tariffs provided a way to finance the new government. So the new Congress approved Hamilton’s recommendation to raise taxes on all manufactured steel, iron, and textile imports. The American economy was still small enough that it could grow by focusing inward. The American economy today is a global one, and U. S. companies have had to expand production —  and their consumer base —  across the world to keep growing. Trump’s pick for U. S. Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, would likely carry out Trump’s protectionist agenda, specifically in negotiating trade deals with Mexico and China. Lighthizer, a trade attorney who was a deputy trade representative under President Ronald Reagan, has made a career out of protecting American steel manufacturers from countries accused of dumping steel into U. S. markets. Though it’s not explicitly illegal for countries to underprice exports, the United States can impose tariffs on foreign companies that are doing so. As an private attorney representing U. S. steel manufacturers, Lighthizer negotiated agreements with foreign steelmakers, such as Japan and South Korea, to restrict their exports or face   tariffs. Lighthizer has repeatedly accused China of unfair trade practices, and it’s likely that he will take an aggressive stance toward international trade and imports. Trump’s choice of economist Peter Navarro to take the new role of trade advisor also reflects a shift toward protectionism. Navarro, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, has attacked China and accused it of waging an economic war against the United States by subsidizing exports, while putting up barriers for American companies that try to do business there. Claude Barfield, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, D. C. is wary that the Trump administration will start trade wars that would ultimately harm the American economy. He says that Trump and Trump’s team share a misguided view that a country that imports more products than it exports is uncompetitive. “That’s just complete nonsense,” says Barfield. “We ran a trade deficit for the last 40 years, at a time when the economy was growing tremendously. ” Raising tariffs on imported goods, such as shoes and clothes made in China, will drastically increase prices for American consumers, he adds. And the countries that Trump singles out will more than likely retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports, therefore limiting the market for American companies. “This is a   scenario,” says Barfield, who is a former consultant to the office of the U. S trade representative. While Trump’s views of trade resemble those from 200 years ago, even Alexander Hamilton cautioned against raising tariffs so high that they would eliminate healthy foreign competition. His idea was to encourage domestic industry, not protect it, argues Douglas Irwin, an economist at Dartmouth College. Hamilton pushed Congress to increase tariffs on foreign steel, textile and iron manufactures to about 10 percent, far below the 45 percent tax Trump suggested he would add to all products from China. Irwin says Hamilton was skeptical about excessive tariffs “because they sheltered inefficient and efficient producers alike, led to higher prices for consumers, and gave rise to smuggling. ” In the Federalist Papers, Hamilton also warned that high taxes on imports would lead to domestic monopolies. So while Trump shares the protectionist economic view of some Founding Fathers, his proposals are even more extreme."
Limbaugh: Black Lives Matter ’Approaching Unionized Gang Status’ - Breitbart,"Monday on his radio show, conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh reacted to a report the Black Lives Matter movement had planned to shut down Memphis, TN’s Graceland, the home of Elvis Presley.  That according to Limbaugh was a sign the   Black Lives Matter movement was approaching what he described to be “unionized gang status. ” Partial transcript as follows: Black Lives Matter plans to shut down Graceland this week.  Elvis Presley’s home.  This is Graceland week, apparently.  In Memphis people show up, and the Coalition of Concerned Citizens  —   I think Black Lives Matter is almost approaching unionized gang status now.  They have imprimatur from the White House.  They have their leaders up there honored for the great work that they do, and they’re  . And they’re gonna go into an event that’s always peaceful and try to cause trouble.  “The Coalition of Concerned Citizens, including Black Lives Matter protesters and other  —  ” I was gonna say gangs, excuse me “ —   groups announce their plan to shut down Graceland. “Protest leaders say the mass demonstration is planned for 6:00pm Monday. They said they specifically chose Graceland because it is Elvis week and they know it will raise awareness. Leaders say they also chose Graceland because ‘it demonstrates one of Memphis’s most common forms of financial inequality and because the site has ties to   …     the death of unarmed teen Darrius Stewart.’ ‘We feel like we still haven’t been answered,’ said Frank Gottie, a community leader. ‘They’re givin’ us the runaround. ’” Graceland has a lot to answer for.  Graceland? Recently in front of Graceland some Black Lives Matter protestors were detained from blocking traffic.  At the time activists said they wanted their demands met by the city, which they admitted would take time.  Graceland’s got nothing to do with anything here.  But they’re showing up.  And they’re gonna have all kinds of attention focused on ’em, sympathetic naturally. (  Daily Rushbo) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor,  "

Pope on Easter: Use ‘Weapons of Love’ to Combat Brutal Violence of Muslim Terror,"In his Easter message to the world on Sunday, Pope Francis condemned terrorism as “a blind and brutal violence,” while proposing that it should be fought with “weapons of love. ”[The Pope was delivering his “Urbi et Orbi” (To the City and the World) message before some 70, 000 pilgrims and tourists who braved tight security to be able to hear the Pope in and around Saint Peter’s Square in Vatican City.  The message has been posted on the Vatican’s website in Arabic, Italian, German, French and Portuguese, but curiously not in English. Pope Francis prayed that the Lord Jesus might embolden all Christians in this Easter holiday to stand close to the victims of terrorism, “a blind and brutal form of violence that continues to shed innocent blood in different parts of the world, as has happened in recent attacks in Belgium, Turkey, Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Iraq. ” “With the weapons of love, God has defeated selfishness and death and His Son Jesus is the door of mercy wide open for everyone,” Francis said. The Pope also said that the Risen Christ “invites us not to forget the men and women on their journey in search of a better future, increasingly great waves of migrants and refugees —  including many children —  fleeing from war, hunger, poverty and social injustice. ” These brothers and sisters of ours, he said, “too often encounter death or rejection from those who could offer them hospitality and help. ” Francis also reached out in his address to “our brothers and sisters who are persecuted for their faith and for their loyalty to the name of Christ,” telling them to remember the consoling words of the Lord: “Do not be afraid! I have overcome the world!” Today, he said, “is the day of this brilliant victory, because Christ trampled death and his resurrection has brought life and immortality. ” Follow Thomas D.

Brooks: The GOP ’Has Become an Ethnic Nationalist Party’ - Breitbart,"On Friday’s broadcast of “PBS NewsHour,” New York Times columnist David Brooks argued the Republican Party “has become an ethnic nationalist party. ”  Brooks said, “Trump today, he  —   you know, buy American, buy American,   trade, and got big cheers. They’re waving Russian flags, probably partly as a joke. But, still, the party has become an ethnic nationalist party. And I don’t think it’s just because they, oh, that we agree with Trump on some things and not on others. I do think, over the last 10 years, a lot of Republicans have decided it’s not working, what the party believed in, free trade, global capitalism, open borders. They looked at basically the failed wars and they said, oh, this, us being the policeman of the world, that’s not working. And so, something really serious has shifted in the minds of Republicans, and certainly others. ” He added, “[W]e had the clip earlier in the program of Trump saying: I’m not president of the globe. I’m president of the United States. Reagan would have never said that. Eisenhower would have never said that, because he would have said, yes, I’m president of the United States, but it’s in our interests to be securing a world order. ” Brooks concluded, “[I]t’s interesting how identity politics and Ann   tactics have now blossomed. But they were always there at CPAC. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"
"Andy McCarthy on Conservative, Libertarian Backers of Sentencing Reform: ‘They’re Open to Almost Anything That Cuts Out the Federal Role in Law Enforcement’ - Breitbart","During his Monday morning appearance on Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon, former Assistant U. S. Attorney and National Review senior fellow Andy McCarthy described the sentencing reform bill that could slash mandatory minimum sentences as the product of an unhealthy political alliance  —   “the worst combination of bad elements coming together. ”   McCarthy said this alliance includes “the Black Lives Matter movement: the people who, hilariously, want to say that the criminal justice system is racist. ”   He found some humor in the notion that the famously   legal profession would produce an “institutionally racist system. ”  “It actually pretty much bends over backward the other way, which is why you get voodoo like ‘disparate impact’ theories, and that sort of stuff get accepted in court, ” he said.  “They’re open to that kind of lunacy.  This is the least racist institution that you can imagine, and everything from the Left side critique of this proceeds on the premise that the system is institutionally racist. ” On the conservative side of sentencing and criminal justice reform, McCarthy noted there were people who “are either of a libertarian bent of mind, or see themselves as Constitutional conservatives, who think that law enforcement is inherently a state function, that the federal government shouldn’t have anything to do with it anyway.  Therefore, they’re open to almost anything that cuts out the federal role in law enforcement. ” “So you have this sort of circle of people coming together, plus you have people like Ryan and the Republican establishment, who are dying to show that they can govern and make Washington work,” said McCarthy, referring to House Speaker Paul Ryan.  He agreed with Bannon that pursuit of media approval for their ostensible compassion and sensitivity was another reason GOP Establishment figures often fell in line behind liberal programs. This misguided alliance between the Left, libertarian Right, and Republican leadership is attacking policies like mandatory minimum sentencing, which McCarthy noted “is crucial to the government for both breaking up these big drug cartels and these big drug organizations, and getting cooperation on them.  “They say there’s something wrong with the mandatory minimums, that they take away the judicial function,” he observed.  “You know, when I was a young prosecutor, one of the first big drug cases I had, we get to sentencing day, and I’m expecting the judge to throw the book at the guy.  And the judge turns to the defendant before he sentences him and says, ‘You know, I believe you lied in your testimony, but I understand why you thought you needed to do it’  —   and basically walked him out the door.  And that was the kind of stuff that was going on before mandatory minimums were put in, in the   or so. ” “What I want people to understand about mandatory minimum is: this is you, the American people, deciding what kind of sentences serious offenders should have,” McCarthy said.   “What was happening, in the case of serious offenses, because we have a lot of   judges walking people who should have been in jail out the door,” he explained.  “And what happened was the people’s representatives  —   who get to control things like sentencing and the definition of crimes  —   got together and said, ‘No, no, no, if you do X crime, if it’s drugs and it involves this amount of narcotics, you have to do 5 years.  And if it’s a bigger amount, you have to do 10 years.  And if there’s a gun involved, we’re gonna tack 5 more years on.’  The reason they did this was precisely to prevent judges from treating serious felony conduct like it was frivolous. ” “The great thing about it is, if we get it wrong, the people’s representatives can amend the laws  —   you know, tweak them up or tweak them down,” he emphasized.  “But what they want to take us back to is a system where there’s basically no rules.  If you want to go back to a system like that, we can do that, but you know, President Obama’s going to have put on about 400 judges on the bench by the time he’s done.  If you think that’s a good environment for letting these judges just decide, on their own, how much time serious offenders should do, I think we’re gonna have havoc. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00AM to 9:00AM EST.

"Iran FM Warns U.S., Saudi Arabia, Israel: ’We Will Defend Ourselves’","TEL AVIV  —   The U. S. Israel and Saudi Arabia should not “get themselves into serious trouble” by taking military action against Iran, the Islamic Republic’s top diplomat said in a BBC interview on Monday. [“First of all, we’re not talking about the law of the jungle,” Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told BBC’s Lyse Doucet.  Referring to a proposal by the U. S. Israel and Saudi Arabia to renew sanctions on Tehran after the country conducted ballistic missile tests, Zarif said, “We’re talking about the international law, and according to international law, those options are a violation of international law. ” “I certainly hope that prudence will prevail because Iran is not an easy target,” Zarif asserted. “We’re not going to provoke anybody. We’re not going to instigate any hostility. We’ve never started hostility, and we’re not planning to do it. But we will defend ourselves. ” “I do not believe that people looking at our history, people looking at our capabilities, will ever make the decision to engage in that misadventure,” the foreign minister added. Zarif further claimed that the Obama administration had been forced to sign the nuclear deal once it understood that sanctions were not a deterrent, and instead were having the reverse effect of strengthening Tehran’s resolve. He added that the nuclear agreement was a fair one that must be maintained by all parties. Following a meeting with Secretary of Defense James Mattis on Friday, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said, “The three main problems we must handle are Iran, Iran and Iran. We must build a genuine and effective coalition to deal with the terrorism [Iran] spreads around the world, the development of missiles it is engaged in and its nuclear arms race. ” The defense chiefs’ meeting occurred two days after President Donald Trump met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House. According to the White House, Iran was also on top of the agenda for the two leaders. Earlier this month, National Security Adviser Mike Flynn warned that he was “putting Iran on notice” following the tests and President Donald Trump vowed that “nothing is off the table” if the Islamic Republic refused to toe the line. In response, chief of the IRGC’s ground forces Brigadier General Mohammad Pakpour warned the U. S. against making threats it couldn’t back up. “The U. S. statesmen should be very wise and avoid threatening Iran, because the entire world has admitted this fact that the Americans cannot do such a thing,” Pakpour told the   Fars news agency. At a security summit in Munich on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence on Saturday called Iran “the leading state sponsor of terrorism. ” “Thanks to the end of   sanctions under the [deal] Iran now has additional resources to devote to these efforts,” Pence said. “Let me be clear again: Under President Trump the United States will remain fully committed to ensuring that Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon capable of threatening   …     our allies in the region, especially Israel,” the vice president added. Earlier this week, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed resistance to Trump’s “measures and threats” and mockingly thanked the president for saving Iran a great deal of trouble by “revealing the real face of America,” characterized by “political, economic, moral and social corruption. ”"

NOAA predicts calm 2015 hurricane season for U.S.," (CNN) The United States may be in the clear this year for hurricane season. There is a 90% chance of a   hurricane season and a lower chance of expected storm activity, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center, which has updated its 2015 Atlantic Hurricane Season Outlook. This means that of the six to 10 named storms for this season, about one to four storms are likely to become hurricanes in 2015.  And there’s an even smaller chance that one of these storms will transform into a major hurricane. The National Hurricane Center calls any Category 3 or higher storm a major hurricane.    But powerful storms can still form during a   season, according to Dr. Gerry Bell, hurricane climate specialist and research meteorologist with NOAA. In 1992, which was a   season, Hurricane Andrew, a Category 5 storm, made landfall in South Florida and   Louisiana, killing 23 people in the United States and causing $26 billion in damage.  It’s still important for coastal residents to be prepared, especially since the peak months of hurricane season have started, Bell said.   The main reason behind this year’s   hurricane season is El Nino. The naturally occurring climate cycle has strengthened, causing several factors that prevent hurricanes from forming, such as increased wind shears, strong winds that travel in a vertical direction and enhanced sinking motion across the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean Sea.  Also, the Atlantic Ocean has had much cooler temperatures, which decreases the chances of major storm activity.  Since 1995, the United States has been in a high hurricane activity area, which typically lasts around 25 years. But for almost a decade, the country hasn’t seen a hurricane greater than a Category 3 storm, putting it in a   hurricane ”drought.” The United States has indeed seen some big storms in the past few years though. In 2012,    Superstorm Sandy, ravaged the Northeast with damaging flooding and powerful winds.  But this has been the longest stretch of time to pass without a major hurricane hitting the United States since reliable record keeping began in 1850, a 2015 NASA study said. ”It’s not clear if we are getting out of this high activity area, or if this is a blip,” Bell said.  This   season is typical during a significant El Nino, he said. Levels like this have been observed from 1950 to present, and 10 of those   seasons have been related to strong El Ninos. El Nino happens as a result from the interaction between the surface of the ocean and the atmosphere in the tropical Pacific, according to NOAA’s website. As a result, changes in the ocean affect atmosphere and climate patterns.  Although the United States may be in for a quieter hurricane season this year, the opposite is true for the other side of the globe, which has seen   conditions.  Some of the strongest storms to have ever been observed have formed in the Pacific in the past few years. Super Typhoon Haiyan hit the central Philippines in 2013, killing more than 6, 000 people. It’s not clear if the Atlantic’s   season is related to climate change though.  ”Hurricanes respond in complicated ways to their environment,” said Timothy Hall, a research scientist who studies hurricanes at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, in a NASA publication in May. ”It’s one of the areas of climate change research where reasonable people can still disagree.” There has been an increase in extreme flooding, droughts and heat waves across the world, but when It comes to tornado and hurricane activity, these events are harder to quantify in terms of climate change, according to CNN’s weather team.

Jon Karl Hits Back at Trump’s Media Attacks - Free Press Is ’a Big Part of What Makes America Great’ - Breitbart,".@jonkarl: ”A free press isn’t the enemy of America it’s a big part of what makes America great.” https:  .  #ThisWeek pic. twitter.  Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” guest host Jon Karl addressed President Donald Trump‘s tweet calling the press the “enemy” of the American people.  Karl said, “There’s been no shortage of outrage over the president’s statements on the press. But I’d like to close with a little perspective. There is nothing new about a President of the United States criticizing or even vilifying the press. Even Thomas Jefferson, the same Thomas Jefferson who wrote the Declaration of Independence and who, ten years after that, wrote, “Our liberty depends on freedom of the press”  —   even Thomas Jefferson, when he was a few years into his own presidency, was so upset about what was being written about his administration that he flatly declared, “Nothing can now be believed that is seen in a newspaper. ” Teddy Roosevelt, who now is next to Jefferson on Mt. Rushmore, once wrote, “To announce there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand with the president, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the American public. ” I couldn’t agree more. But I also know that T. R. wrote that nearly a decade after he left office. When he was still in the White House, he coined the term “muckrakers” to denounce investigative journalists who he felt were so obsessed with the negative that they were missing the good in the world.

Christian Farmer Barred from Michigan Market Because of Views on Gay Marriage - Breitbart,"A Catholic apple grower in Michigan has been barred from a city farmers’ market over his views on   marriage, after he refused to host a lesbian couple’s wedding at his orchard. [Stephen Tennes, the owner of Country Mill Farms, has sold his fruit and vegetables at the East Lansing Farmer’s Market for the past seven years. After city officials learned of his Christian belief that marriage is the union between one man and one woman, they invoked a   policy to exclude him from being able to sell at the farmers’ market.   Tennes says he was barred from selling his produce after his business, Country Mill Farms, refused to host a lesbian couple’s wedding at its orchard in Charlotte, 22 miles outside East Lansing. Explaining his position on Facebook, Tennes cited his “Catholic belief that marriage is a sacramental union between one man and one woman. ” In a statement, the city of East Lansing said the farmer’s decision not to host a   wedding violated a “  ordinance that protects sexual orientation as well as the Supreme Court’s ruling that grants the right for   couples to be married. ” In point of fact, the city introduced a modification to the city’s farmers market vendor agreement just this year requiring sellers to comply with East Lansing’s Human Relations Ordinance. Among other things, the ordinance prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity and expression. The city’s punitive action targets the farmer’s use of his own private property, 22 miles outside the city and well outside its jurisdiction. Mr. Tennes has declared that he does not discriminate against LGBT customers at the farmer’s market, and gladly sells his produce to all comers. “It’s our faith that informs us how to treat all who come to our farm and the farmers market with dignity and decency   …     serving customers of many races, religions, cultures and those who identify with the LBGT community,” he said. When it came to actually hosting a   marriage that contradicts his biblical understanding of the nature of marriage, Tennes felt obliged to decline. “Our faith and beliefs on marriage and hosting weddings at our home and in our backyard of our farm have nothing to do with the city of East Lansing,” Tennes said at a press conference. According to Gay Star News, the biblical view of marriage is “homophobic” and the City of East Lansing barred Tennes for his “homophobic religious views. ” On Wednesday, May 31, Tennes filed a federal lawsuit against the city of East Lansing seeking his reinstatement at the market.  According to the lawsuit, Country Mill is the only business to have been prohibited under the market’s   policy. The Alliance Defending Freedom, a nonprofit legal organization specializing in religious liberty cases, is representing Tennes. They have asserted that his religious views on marriage have no bearing on his involvement at the market and said the city’s actions amounted to a First Amendment violation. “Steve and his farm have been singled out and excluded from full participation in the life of the community for only one reason,” said ADF counsel Kate Anderson. “Steve expressed a viewpoint the city did not like. ” “If the government can shut down a family farmer just because of the religious views he expresses on Facebook   …     then no American is free,” Anderson said.

Tech Execs Indicted for H-1B Visa Fraud,"A pair of tech executives have been indicted for allegedly using false documents to bring in help through the   guest worker program. [Dynasoft Synergy’s Chief Executive Officer Jayavel Murugan, 46, and    Syed Nawaz are accused in an unsealed federal grand jury indictment of trying to apply for   visa workers using fraudulent documents and then hiring them out to tech firms, according to Mercury News.  Dynasoft operates as an “employment firm” that essentially leases foreign workers. The company also has an office in India. According to prosecutors, Murugan and Nawaz used the false documents to replace American workers at Stanford University, Cisco, and Brocade. Nonetheless, the employers were not looking to use the   workers, despite being named in the false documents allegedly produced by the two men. Murugan and Nawaz are charged with 26 counts including   visa fraud, using fraudulent documents, mail fraud, identity theft, and conspiracy to commit visa fraud. The federal indictments point to a much bigger problem with the   visa program, where millions of American workers have been ousted to make way for cheaper, foreign workers. President of Protect U. S. Workers Sara Blackwell, an attorney who represents American workers that are victims of the   visa system, told Breitbart Texas that fraud cases within the   program are just one facet. “Fraud is very rampant in the visa process,” Blackwell told Breitbart Texas. “The legitimate   visa program is awful enough. I see fraud   …     I hear about it constantly. It’s very, very common. ” Every year, some 85, 000   applications are applied for by tech giants, U. S. corporations, and foreign employment firms. “The big CEOs literally say that it’s cheap labor,” Blackwell said. If the   visa program had never been introduced and enacted, computer science job availability in the labor market would be up 11 percent and wages in the tech industry would have increased by five percent, as Breitbart News reported. The   visa remains incredibly unpopular with American voters. As Breitbart Texas reported, only 30 percent of Americans say companies bringing in foreign workers to fill jobs are necessary. Additionally, some 44 percent said those foreign workers take jobs away. The vast majority of Americans also said the number of   visas allotted every year to companies should either be decreased or kept at the current levels.   “reform” legislation that has been marketed by two congressmen as a step in the right direction to weeding out abuses in the   visa program would actually have zero impact, an expert told Breitbart Texas. Companies like IBM, Disney, Microsoft, and Facebook have all asked Congress to increase the number of   foreign workers that are brought into the U. S. every year, the New York Times reported, making it even more likely for American workers to be fired from their jobs to make room for foreign labor.

"Under Clinton Presidency, U.S. Muslim Population Would Exceed Germany’s by 2024 - Breitbart","Under two terms of a President Hillary Clinton, the U. S. Muslim population would exceed Germany’s current Muslim population, according to data from Pew Research Center and the Department of Homeland Security. [According to a Pew report published earlier this week, “as of 2010, there were 4. 8 million Muslims in Germany. ”  A Pew report from January of this year estimated that there are roughly 3. 3 million Muslims living in the United States. This means that today the U. S. already has a larger Muslim population than does Kuwait, or Brunei, or Bahrain, or Djibouti, or Qatar. Under current policy, Pew projects the number of Muslims in America will outnumber Jews by 2040. However, under a President Hillary Clinton it’s possible that date could come much sooner. Under two terms of a Hillary Clinton presidency, the U. S. would have a Muslim population that is larger than Germany’s Muslim population of 4. 8 million. Based on the most recent DHS data available, the U. S. permanently resettled roughly 149, 000 migrants from predominantly Muslim countries on green cards in 2014. Yet, as Donald Trump explained during Thursday night acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, Clinton “has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama. ” Specifically, Clinton had said that, as president, she would expand Muslim migration by importing an additional 65, 000 Syrian refugees into the United States during the course of a single fiscal year. Clinton has made no indication that she would limit her proposed Syrian refugee program to one year. As Trump explained, Clinton’s Syrian refugees would come on top of the tens of thousands of refugees the U. S. already admits from Muslim countries. Adding Clinton’s 65, 000 Syrian refugees to the approximately 149, 000 Muslim migrants the U. S. resettled on green cards in the course of one year, means that Clinton could permanently resettle roughly 214, 000 Muslim migrants in her first year as President. If Clinton were to continue her Syrian refugee program throughout her Presidency, she could potentially resettle roughly 1. 5 million Muslim migrants during her first two terms. These projections suggest that after seven years of a Hillary Clinton Presidency, the U. S. could have a Muslim population that is larger than Germany’s Muslim population of 4. 8 million. These projections are rough estimates, and the population size could be impacted by additional various factors —   including births, deaths, and conversions. Many have warned if the U. S. continues at its current record pace of Muslim migration —  or if   migration politicians, such as Paul Ryan and Hillary Clinton, further increase Muslim migration —  the U. S. risks following in Europe’s footsteps. As Sen. Jeff Sessions has previously explained, “it’s an unpleasant, but unavoidable fact that bringing in large unassimilated flows of migrants from the Muslim world creates the conditions possible for radicalisation and extremism to take hold, just like they’re seeing in Europe. ” Andrew McCarthy has similarly argued that the   importation of “  Muslim migrants” enables the development of pockets of   communities that can serve as breeding grounds for radicalization —  as they have in Europe. McCarthy has explained that, as we are seeing “in Europe and the Middle East, jihadism thrives when it has a support system of   Muslims. In Europe this means  —   as it would mean here  —   enclaves of   Muslims  …     It is patently obvious that our security challenge is not just jihadists it is the combination of jihadists and their support network of   Muslims. Indeed, even if we could vet for all the currently active jihadists, it is from the   Islamic communities that future “homegrown” jihadists will emerge  —   and that is apart from the material and moral support jihadists get from   Islamists in these communities. ” Sessions has aruged that vetting migrants means not simply keeping out people who currently have terror aspirations and already have ties to terror groups, but also keeping out those who —  based on their support for Islamist ideology —   could be candidates for terror, or whose children could become candidates for terror, or who hold values that are hostile to American values. Yet politicians in both parties, who have voted to expand Muslim migration into the U. S. have ruled out vetting measures that could take these factors into account. Both Hillary Clinton and Paul Ryan have argued it’s inappropriate to examine the religious views of an applicant —   in essence, this suggests that the U. S. can’t screen out migrants based on their potential support for ideologies that may be       or   freedom. Yet neither Clinton nor Ryan have explained why importing hundreds of thousands of migrants from nations that may hold sentiments that are       tolerance, and   benefits the United States or helps to protect American values."
Trump’s statements about Qatar ’funding extremism’ directly contradict his own State Department’s stance,"’  ’ ”   President Donald Trump’s  backing the diplomatic isolation of Qatar by   several Gulf nations seem to depart from his own State   Department’s stance on the issue. ” ’   On Monday, the governments of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab   Emirates, Egypt, and Bahrain announced they had severed   diplomatic relations with Qatar. ’ ’   Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was quick to urge   representatives of each country to ”sit down together and address   these differences” and said the US thinks it’’s important that the   Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Qatar as well as Saudi   Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain to ”remain   unified.” ’ ’   Tillerson also said he doesn’’t think the diplomatic isolation of   Qatar would have ”any significant impact, if any impact at all”   on the ”fight against terrorism in the region or globally.” ’ ”   But Trump hit Twitter on Tuesday morning to deliver a message   that stood in stark contrast to the measured calm of Tillerson’s   statements. ” ’’ ’   In a series of tweets, Trump appeared to take credit for the     move. He visited Saudi Arabia last month and met   with some Gulf leaders. ’ ’   ”During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can   no longer be funding of Radical Ideology,” Trump .   ”Leaders pointed to Qatar   look!” ’ ’   Trump    that it was ”so good” to see his Saudi Arabia visit ”already   paying off.” ’ ’   ”They said they would take a hard line on funding . .. extremism,   and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the   beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!” Trump tweeted. ’ ”   Before he started tweeting about Qatar, Trump made clear that   it’s his message voters should rely on to convey how he really   feels. ” ’   ”The FAKE MSM is working so hard trying to get me not to use   Social Media,” he    in reference to the mainstream media. ”They hate that I can get   the honest and unfiltered message out.” ’ ’   But Trump’’s remarks stand in contrast even to his own previous   comments on Qatar. He told the emir last month that ”our   relationship is extremely good” with the country. ’ ’   State Department officials reinforced this message on Tuesday. ’ ’   ”Our relationship with Qatar is one that’’s strong,” State   Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert  at a press briefing Tuesday afternoon. ”We   continue to cooperate with Qatar and other countries in the   region in the fight against terrorism.” ’ ’   She continued: ”We recognize that Qatar has made great efforts to   try to stop financing of terror groups . .. However, let me make   this clear: they have made progress, but they still have work to   do.” ’ ’   When asked about the apparent contradiction between Trump’’s   statements and the State Department’’s stance, Nauert said   Secretary of State Tillerson has been clear in the past that   Trump’’s tweets are ”serving the president pretty well.” ’ ’   ”The secretary says, ’’I don’’t intend to advise him on how to   communicate.

Iranian Patrol Boat Trains Weapons on U.S. Navy Helicopter - Breitbart,"On Saturday, as the USS Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group passed through the Strait of Hormuz, an Iranian patrol boat trained a   weapon on a U. S. Navy helicopter. [The Iranians did not open fire, but the Pentagon described it as the latest of over two dozen “unsafe and unprofessional” encounters with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps in the past year.  “During a routine daylight transit of the Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group through the strait linking the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, two Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy fast patrol boats tailed the CSG,” two defense officials told USNI News. “The CSG launched an   Seahawk to investigate the vicinity and monitor the boats during the transit of the carrier and its escorts,” the report continues. “At about a half mile from the helicopter, the crew of one of the two boats trained their weapon on the helicopter twice before the helicopter returned to USS Eisenhower ( ). The patrol boats did not come close to the carrier itself, the officials said. ” The crew of the helicopter reportedly did not feel they were in imminent danger of being attacked. As USNI News observes, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy is “separate from the regular Iranian military” and reports to “the sectarian wing of Iran’s government,” so its actions are difficult to pass off as mistakes made by rogue sailors. “If they continue to test us, we are going to respond, and we are going to protect ourselves and our partners,” said General Joseph Votel, commander of U. S. Central Command, at a Pentagon conference after the worst of the IRGCN’s provocations in August. CNN recalls Votel saying these provocations are caused by an Iranian regime that desires to “continue to do these types of things that stoke instability or attempt to stoke instability in the region. ” CNN also reported that on Saturday, the chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces talked about establishing naval bases in both Syria and Yemen. Reuters notes this marks Iran’s first provocation since Donald Trump won the presidential election and recalls Trump declaring during his campaign that any Iranian vessel which harassed the U. S. Navy would be “shot out of the water. ” More specifically, Trump said: “When they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats and they make gestures at our people that they shouldn’t be allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water. ”"
King Salman Snubs Obama Again as He Arrives for Saudi Arabia Summit,"This morning’s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics. com,  President Obama and Saudi King Salman in the Erga Palace in Riyadh on Wednesday (AP) In May of last year, President Obama invited the leaders of the Arab nations in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to a meeting at Camp David. Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz al Saud snubbed Obama by not attending the meeting. ( “   World View  —   Obama repudiates the Carter doctrine at bizarre GCC meeting”) Now King Salman has snubbed Obama once again, this time in an even more embarrassing manner, as Obama arrived in Riyadh on Wednesday on Air Force One. King Salman was not there to greet him. Instead, a   official greeted him. Saudi state television did not show Obama’s arrival live, but did provide live coverage of the arrival of other Gulf nation leaders  —   being greeted by King Salman. Relations have been worsening ever since President Obama took office, especially when Obama appeared to throw Hosni Mubarak under the bus during the 2011 Arab Awakening. (See  “   News  —   Saudi Arabia advances Gulf Cooperation Council, further cuts U. S. ties. ”) Last year, Obama referred to Saudi Arabia as a “  ally,” because of its opposition to the Iran nuclear deal. Recently, the Saudis were deeply offended when Obama characterized some of his allies as “free riders. ” ( “   World View  —   Saudi’s Prince Faisal sharply rebukes Obama’s ‘free riders’ accusation”) No one should be surprised at all that the Saudis have snubbed and embarrassed Obama twice in two years. Washington Times and CNN, According to a WSJ article that  I quoted in July of last year, Obama saw the deal with Iran as a kind of “gateway” to solve all the problems in the Mideast: The White House is crafting a Middle East strategy for the remaining 18 months of President Barack Obama’s term that would more forcefully address conflicts in Iraq, Yemen and Syria amid tensions over the conclusion of talks with Iran. [  …    ] [S]enior administration officials said the president is intent on cleaning up leftover messes in the region before leaving office in 2017, including relations with key allies that have been strained by the Iran talks. And this is no joke. Just last week, US Secretary of State John Kerry was in Kabul, Afghanistan, lecturing government leaders how to run their governments. That was just a couple of days before the massive terrorist explosion in Kabul. ( “   World View  —   Troubles mount for Afghanistan government as US withdrawal looms”) So President Obama has been in office for    years, and he apparently believes that he has been so skillful in governing America that he now feels qualified to lecture leaders of any country in the world on what they are doing wrong. According to reports, that is what he did on Wednesday in his meetings with King Salman in Saudi Arabia. Reports indicate that Obama raised the following issues: People always criticize me when I criticize Obama, but if these reports are true, then this is about the dumbest thing I’ve every seen. The Saudis see Iran as an existential threat. As we have been pointing out for two years, analysts note that the Saudis feel surrounded by the “Shia Crescent,” with Iran dominating control of four capitals  —   Tehran, Iran Damascus, Syria Beirut, Lebanon (thanks to the   terror group Hezbollah) and Sanaa, Yemen. A fifth under partial control is Baghdad, Iraq. Telling the Saudis to “share the neighborhood” with Iran is absurd and offensive. From the point of view of the Saudis, every one of Obama’s “suggestions” makes the situation much worse. The nuclear deal with Iran has removed sanctions and given Iran hundreds of billions of dollars more to use in sponsoring wars and terrorist acts. Exiting the war in Yemen would give complete control to the   Houthis. Apparently, Obama has no grasp of any of this, as shown by the fact that the Saudi king has repeatedly snubbed Obama. Obama supposedly believes that this trip will soothe   relations, but it will probably only make relations worse. The Arab world is furious at Obama. Obama’s “free riders” statement alone sparked hundreds of scathing articles against him in the Gulf press. Well, we’ll be watching to see which country and which leader Obama will be lecturing to next. However, from the point of view of Generational Dynamics, this growing   estrangement is exactly consistent with what Generational Dynamics has been predicting for years, as I explained in detail in  “   World View  —   Arab views of Iran nuclear deal”: In the coming Clash of Civilizations world war, the US, India, Russia and Iran would be allies opposing China, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the Sunni Muslim countries.

Tight Seal on Secret Service Officer’s Tell-All Book About Clintons: Contents Hinted in Grand Jury Testimony - Breitbart,"The publisher is keeping a tight seal on the contents of a new   book about the Clintons by their former Secret Service bodyguard  —   but Breitbart News has found clues in the former officer’s 1998 testimony during the   investigations. [Gary Byrne, the Secret Service uniformed officer, was stationed at one of the most critical choke points in the Free World:   the small desk just outside Oval Office.  “Posted directly outside President Clinton’s Oval Office, Former Secret Service uniformed officer Gary Byrne reveals what he observed of Hillary Clinton’s character and the culture inside the White House while protecting the First Family,” according to the press release for “Crisis of Character,” due out June 28. “We’re there all the time. I mean, we’re sort of like doorknobs,” Byrne said in his 1998 testimony to the Grand Jury investigating the president’s relationship with his   Monica Lewinsky. “I know that’s kind of a little hard to fathom, but I mean people have had incredible personal conversations in front of me,” Byrne told Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Byrne and other officers at this desk were the ones Clinton would tell: “Miss Lewinsky will be a while, you can shut the door. ” When Lewinsky would ask to be admitted in the Oval Office, often she would tell the officer on duty that she had “some papers for the president. ” Starr and his staff determined was   code for a sexual encounter. Another character, who may play a big part in the book is Navy Chief Petty Officer Bayani “Nels” Nelvis, the West Wing steward. The retired steward’s Facebook page features a photo of the White House with a Secret Service badge and the admonition: “Remember who you are and what you represent. ” Nelvis and Byrne became friends and the chief would ask Byrne to help him reach items in the pantry on high shelves and share with him his workplace frustrations. It was to Byrne that Nelvis complained about   towels left strewn by the president and his consorts in the private study adjacent to the Oval Office. Byrne told the grand jury that he told the steward to throw the towels away, instead of taking them to the laundry. Byrne said he was concerned the people would connect the towels to Clinton. Byrne knew about Lewinsky, but he knew about others, too. “My fear was that regardless of whose  —   if there was lipstick on there, regardless of whose it was, that when the people that did the laundry saw it, you know, I just didn’t want to give anybody any more fuel for any more rumors about the President,” he told the grand jury. On one of her visits to president’s section of the West Wing during the afternoon of New Year’s Eve 1995, Lewinsky told Nelvis told that she had smoked her first cigar. Nelvis told the president’s mistress that he would get her one of the White House cigars with the presidential seal on the band. “Just then, the President came down the hallway from the Oval Office and saw Ms. Lewinsky. The President dispatched Mr. Nelvis to deliver something to Mr. Panetta. ” Three months later, March 31, 1996, while the First Lady was in Ireland, Clinton called Lewinsky at her desk and asked her to bring over some papers. Promptly, she grabbed a folder and was admitted into the Oval Office by Secret Service plainclothes agent. Opening the folder, Lewinsky took out a Hugo Boss tie for her boss. Her boss then led her from the Oval Office into the hallway connecting the office to his private study. Byrne’s publisher is making a promise, too. “Byrne exposes the truth behind Hillary, Bill, and their public facade,” the press release said. The officer’s book is called a firsthand account of the scandals —  known and unknown —  and daily trials ranging from the minor to national in scale. “Having witnessed the personal and political dysfunction of the Clinton White House —  so consumed by scandal and destroying their enemies, real and imagined —  Byrne came to understand that, to the Clintons, governing was an afterthought,” the release said. “He now tells this story —  before voters go to the polls —  in the hopes that Clinton supporters will understand the real Hillary Clinton. ” OK. Let’s find out."
"Feds, NYPD Conduct Largest Gang Bust in New York City’s History As Republicans Plot ’Jailbreak’ Bill - Breitbart","The NYPD arrested 120 suspected gang members in the biggest   in New York City’s history, CBS New York reports, for crimes such as murder, robbery, drug trafficking, and more. [Federal authorities from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Drug Enforcement Agency also took part in the raids as more than 1, 000 law enforcement officers in helicopters and armored trucks nabbed suspects from the “2Fly YGz” and the “Big Money Bosses” gangs accused of “terrorizing residents” for years with their violent lawlessness. Sources tell the New York Daily News that the suspects may be responsible for seven murders, including the death of a    woman killed by a stray bullet.  The massive takedown in the Bronx comes as Republicans debate a sentencing reduction and early release bill for convicted criminals and the Obama administration celebrates “National Reentry Week” for convicted criminals, many of whom are violent repeat offenders. Many of the arrested Bronx suspects appear to be young adults. If convicted, they’re primed to become beneficiaries of the Obama administration’s   dollar efforts to ensure that as   they can receive more taxpayer dollars. Attorney General Loretta Lynch calls criminals under the age of 24 convicted of serious crimes “  youth” and is working to expunge or seal some criminal records so they suffer few if any ongoing consequences for destroying lives and Americans don’t know if they’re dealing with a dangerous criminal. Even if convicted of murder and other violent crimes, the felons can move to Virginia and enjoy voting rights, the ability to run for office and serve on juries, and work as a notary. Longtime Clinton ally Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe granted 206, 000 felons these rights just months before the presidential election  —   and that’s just a start. They can enjoy the same rights as their victims and lifelong,   citizens. Republicans pushing sentencing reductions in Congress, which conservative journalist David Horowitz criticizes as “jailbreak” legislation, are repeating the same lines as the Democrats about the myth of “mass incarceration” and the sudden need to help Democrats hasten the release of criminals to ply them with more taxpayer money and give them a   over  . They couch it in the language of togetherness  —   as president of the American Enterprise Institute Arthur Brooks said at the White House on Monday: “What better way to bring people together than to look at those at the periphery of our society and say, what can we do together to need them?” But Americans not safely isolated in gated, superrich neighborhoods like D. C. think tank leaders don’t appear to want “to need” those who have shown themselves to be a menace to society  —   as residents of Bronx neighborhoods can testify. As Speaker Paul Ryan rushes to ensure more gang members like those who held a poor New York neighborhood hostage are released back into the streets,   blacks and whites, along with swing voters, are growing more and more deeply worried about crime. The poll numbers are even more lopsided when broken down: While 46 percent of whites are greatly worried about crime, 68 percent of   are. The bipartisan scheme to break more convicts out of prison as crime soars isn’t likely to put their fears to rest."
Three Dead After Shots Ring Out at House Party North of Seattle,"Three persons were killed and a fourth was wounded after a man with a gun walked into a party at a residence north of Seattle and opened fire. [The incident occurred early Saturday in the town of Mukilteo.  According to   about   people were at the house when the attack took place. One witness —     Alexis Gemmer —  told her grandmother she “was hanging out with friends from Kamiak High School at a home in Mukilteo early Saturday when a young man showed up with a rifle. ” The grandmother said her granddaughter “hid in a closet, from where she called and texted” that she was okay. The gunman and one of the victims are alleged to have “recently broken up. ” The Star reports that the gunman “[killed] two people at a fire pit”‘ then went to the roof and shot at other individuals from there. “Washington State Patrol Trooper Will Finn said the male suspect was pulled over at around 2 a. m. heading south on Interstate 5 near Chehalis, about 113 miles away” from the site of the attack. He was taken into custody. Washington state instituted universal background checks in 2014 to prevent high profile shootings.

New to Airbnb? How to Make It Work for You - The New York Times,"I have a confession: before writing this column, I had never used Airbnb. My first experience with this San     marketplace, which was founded in 2008 and dropped a proverbial bomb on the hotel industry, came when I visited Milwaukee in April. Before then, I had been hesitant to use the service: What if something went wrong? What if the place was grossly misrepresented? What if the owner tried to unfairly pin a broken dish or a rip in the sofa on me? The possibilities for something going wrong, it seemed, were endless. Eventually, though, I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb. Or, at the very least, embrace it from time to time, depending on what I was looking for during my travels. That, I learned, is the key to using Airbnb: By knowing what you want in your lodgings, you can make the service work for you. [Update Sept. 8:] Airbnb has released a lengthy report and made changes to its platform in response to complaints about hosts discriminating against potential renters. Among other things, the company will be making hosts agree to a more detailed   policy, increasing the availability of Instant Book listings, and experimenting with “reducing the prominence” of user photos.   users who do not want to go through the typical vetting process of a standard Airbnb experience can use the Instant Book feature  —   hosts can still cancel, however, if they have “concerns about the reservation. ” Simply refusing to include a picture of yourself in your profile is another option. Regardless, if you feel you’ve been the victim of discrimination, don’t stay quiet: Write to Airbnb immediately. Here are a few tips for   users. DECIDE THE KIND OF EXPERIENCE YOU WANT Don’t feel like leaving your comfort zone? Want to get in and get out of a city quickly, with minimal hassle? A traditional hotel may be for you. The   process is predictable, there are creature comforts like housekeeping, and you can expect a certain minimal level of service. If you’re feeling a bit more adventurous, though, you could explore Airbnb. There, you would find opportunities for a more local experience than you could ever hope to have by staying in a traditional hotel. In Moscow, I stayed in the gorgeous artist’s studio of a local sculptor and got to know him and his wife. He shared his likenesses of Lenin and Yuri Gagarin, and she spent an afternoon showing me around the city. It was a unique experience I’ll never forget. BE REALISTIC One aspect that draws travelers to Airbnb is that it is frequently cheaper than hotels. Therefore, it’s important to temper your expectations. The bed may not be perfect, the faucet may leak, and the   may be spotty. Oh, and the “breakfast” part of “  ”? Best to take that with a grain of salt it hasn’t existed in any of the Airbnbs that I’ve booked. The greater informality can have its advantages, too. It lends itself to more flexibility as far as what time you can check in, for example, as well as what to do when you check out. In at least two places I’ve booked, “Just leave the keys under the mat” was the only instruction I received. KNOW WHAT YOU’RE GETTING You don’t want to show up at your booking with your significant other and awkwardly encounter another person  —   or worse, another couple  —   staying in the same place. The headings in the Airbnb listings search are: “Entire  ”: You’re booking an entire apartment or house and should not expect to share the space “Private room”: You are booking a private room within someone else’s home (bathroom privileges may vary) and “Shared room”: You’re in a bunk   situation (this is generally the cheapest rental). Pay attention to your search parameters so that there are no rude surprises. Chances are, if you’re getting an insanely good deal on that beachfront villa, you’re probably not going to be there alone. MESSAGE YOUR HOST BEFOREHAND There’s a natural vetting process with Airbnb. You have to message your hosts when you request to stay at their home, and they vet your message, and you, before they approve the stay. This allows the hosts to pick and choose their guests (and unfortunately has also led to cases of racial discrimination). There is also an Instant Book option, denoted by a small lightning bolt, that allows you to make a booking without sending a message or request. Generally, though, the more you communicate ahead of time with your host, the better. You can exchange information, coordinate schedules and figure out the best time to hand off keys. A quick    to get to know the person whose home you’re renting (and vice versa) makes for a more comfortable and pleasant experience. REALIZE THAT FILTERS ARE YOUR FRIEND After the initial landing page, when you’ve entered the basic parameters of your stay, you’ll see a map with your lodging options. On the left side, above the first listing, is a button labeled “Filters. ” Click on it, and you can whittle down your options by the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, as well as the neighborhood. Scroll down to “Amenities. ” Initially you’ll see a few choices. But on the right side, you’ll see a small black arrow. Click on it to reveal many more options. Do you absolutely have to bring your dog along? Check off the “Pets Allowed” option. You can be very granular with your parameters if you want the host to provide shampoo, or if you require a lock on the bedroom door, you can search for that, too. KNOW THE CANCELLATION POLICY Before you book, know your host’s cancellation policy. Cancellation policies can vary from “Flexible,” meaning you’re allowed a refund provided you cancel within 24 hours of arrival, to “Strict,” which will afford you only a 50 percent refund  —   provided you canceled at least a week ahead of time. Either way, say goodbye to Airbnb’s nonrefundable fee, the exact calculus of which is maddeningly unspecific  —   it is “typically  % but can be higher or lower,” according to the website. WHEN IN DOUBT, TAKE PICTURES There are far more horror stories of guests damaging the homes of Airbnb hosts than of nightmare hosts, but it’s always good to be safe. When you arrive, do a quick inspection for any damage to the walls or furniture, and snap a few quick pictures  —   if you have a smartphone, a couple of panorama shots would do nicely. If you do notice something problematic, mention it right away to your host. Do this by communicating through the Airbnb website  —   not by sending personal emails back and forth. When you leave, take a couple of quick shots, as well. In the unlikely event of a dispute,   photos would help you prove you left your rental in good condition. LEAVE FEEDBACK The Airbnb ecosystem lives and dies by honest feedback. Reading reviews is the best way to learn about the quality of a rental and the best way to weed out the bad eggs who misrepresent their properties, or worse. So it behooves you, after your stay, to leave honest feedback and to rate various aspects of the property on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. But don’t think this goes only one way  —   hosts can also leave reviews of their guests. STILL UNSURE? RENT FROM A ‘SUPERHOST’ If you are wary about staying in a stranger’s home, you have the option of renting from a Superhost  —   someone who has consistently received positive reviews, denoted with a small gold medal by the profile. Eighty percent of Superhosts’ reviews have been awarded five stars, and Superhosts are held to high standards of responsiveness and following through with their bookings (i. e. not canceling at the last minute). Using Airbnb for the first time can be both an exciting and slightly anxious experience  —   I felt that way myself. If you have reservations but want to test the waters, a Superhost’s home may be a good first stay."
Glenn Beck apologizes to listeners for backing Ted Cruz ," (CNN) Glenn Beck, a staunch Ted Cruz supporter in the 2016 GOP presidential race, interviewed the Texas senator Monday in a series of   exchanges, after Cruz finally endorsed GOP   Donald Trump.  It ended with Beck apologizing to listeners for backing Cruz. ”Do you have any new information that has made you say ’Oh my gosh, he’s now not a sociopathic liar and now there’s suddenly a reason to believe him? ’” Beck had asked Cruz on ”The Glenn Beck Radio Program.” Cruz, who in July dramatically declined to endorse Trump during his Republican National Convention, responded that the election is ”is a binary choice” between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Trump.  Cruz said he was never ”Never Trump,” but always ”Never Hillary.” But Beck repeatedly asked Cruz why he changed his mind and decided to back Trump.  ”This is all the information you had in Cleveland,” Beck said, unsatisfied by Cruz’s answers. ”What I was trying to do in Cleveland was lay out a path to uniting Republicans,” Cruz said. ”This is about principle, about ideas. That’s the test I’m applying. What I do know is that Hillary Clinton fails that test profoundly.” After the interview concluded, Beck said for the first time, he ”heard Ted Cruz calculate.” Beck ended his conservative radio program with an apology to his listeners for supporting Cruz, adding that he should have backed Marco Rubio instead.  ”That was so calculated that it was stunning to me,” Beck said. ”I think I have to apologize and say, maybe, perhaps, those of you who said Ted Cruz is calculating and a smarmy politician, I think I may have to slightly agree with you and apologize for saying, ’No, he wasn’t. ’”"
Indivisible hopes to be tea party’s flip side," (CNN) We’ve seen this movie before. A new president blows into Washington, promising to forever change the status quo. He makes bold moves to fulfill those campaign promises. In response, large groups of citizens turn up in the streets and at congressional town halls to (loudly) voice their unhappiness and oppose the president’s proposed policies. Sound familiar? In the summer of 2009 it was the tea party, which pretty much declared war on President Barack Obama’s stimulus package and health care proposals. In the winter of 2017 it’s Indivisible, a group that’s pretty much opposed to all things Trump. Indivisible made its biggest splash just this week when some of its affiliated groups made their voices heard at GOP congressional town hall meetings. Shellshocked, It started out a couple of days after Thanksgiving, at a bar in Austin, Texas, as a conversation between a liberal husband and wife about what to do about Donald Trump. It’s morphed into a nationwide movement, comprising 7, 000 affiliated groups in all 50 states and almost every congressional district. That husband and wife, former congressional staffers Ezra Levin and Leah Greenberg, were like a lot of Democrats after the 2016 presidential election    shellshocked. Liberals wanted to fight back effectively but had no idea how. ”There was this overwhelming cry from different groups of people about not knowing what steps to take in order to fight,” said Sarah Dohl, an Indivisible board member and former communications director for Democratic US Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas. ”We thought we could help.” Echoes of 2009, So Dohl, Greenberg, Levin and a few other people put together a guide of sorts for liberal activism in the age of Trump. Dohl and Levin worked together in Doggett’s office during 2009’s tea party summer and witnessed firsthand how a loosely affiliated group of conservatives was able to band together to stymie Obama’s agenda. So tea party strategies have been incorporated into Indivisible’s guide. ”We believe that the way progressives can win is by emulating two of the tea party’s tactics: local activism and defensive politics,” said Dohl. ”We can do what the tea party did in 2009. They effectively slowed federal policy making to a halt. That’s not obstruction for the sake of obstruction, but to save our own progressive ideals.” The guide notes that the tea party activists took ”on a popular president with a mandate for change and a supermajority in Congress. We saw them organize locally and convince their own (members of Congress) to reject President Obama’s agenda.” Indivisible (Dohl said they wanted a phrase or name with a historical connotation) says it can do the same to President Trump, with what it sees as one key advantage. ”Trump is not popular. He does not have a mandate. He does not have large congressional majorities,” the guide says. ”If a small minority in the tea party could stop President Obama, then we the majority can stop a petty tyrant named Trump.” ’Just here to help’ Indivisible’s guide    in a ”poorly formatted,   Google Doc”    was on the Internet by December, but it really took off in liberal corners of the Internet when progressive policy heavyweights like Robert Reich, the former secretary of labor during the Clinton administration, tweeted it out on social media. Now the group has a little more structure. A more sophisticated website, which Dohl says has gotten about 10 million page views, has replaced the Google Doc. Indivisible became a nonprofit about three weeks ago. About 100 volunteers around the country    working remotely nights and weekends because Indivisible doesn’t have an office    do the grunt work of handling emails and social media, maintaining the website and providing congressional updates. But Indivisible’s board members     Levin, Greenberg, Dohl, immigrant rights advocate Angel Padilla and union organizer Matt Traldi    stress they’re not trying to lead the   movement. ”The last few weeks have made it abundantly clear that local groups are taking ownership of the resistance to Trump’s agenda themselves,” Indivisible says on its website.  ”You all are the leaders    we’re just here to help.” Indivisible started taking online donations about two weeks ago, but Dohl stresses that none of its money is coming from billionaire George Soros, whose name is often mentioned in conservative circles as backing all kinds of liberal causes. ”We haven’t received any money from him,” she said. ”Those checks must have been lost in the mail.” Talking tactics, Moving forward, Indivisible wants to do two things: make it easier for everyday citizens to advocate for the causes they believe in and help local groups implement Indivisible’s online guide for ”resisting the Trump agenda.” The guide goes on to list tactics the former congressional staffers say work when dealing with Congress: attending town halls, showing up at other public events where a member of Congress may appear (like a   ceremony) visiting district offices and calling congressional offices. That first tactic    showing up at town halls    was a popular one this week. Progressives and liberals, including some   local groups, have been flooding GOP town halls and other    events, allowing them to publicly lambast the very people trying to roll back Obama’s agenda. But Democrats aren’t safe from Indivisible’s wrath, either. Just like the tea party tormented GOP members it felt weren’t strong enough against Obama, Dohl says it’s important for progressives ”to stiffen the spine” of congressional Democrats. ’Do your job!’ Thursday night, two Republican members of Congress    Reps. Jason Chaffetz of Utah and Diane Black of Tennessee    were each confronted with impassioned constituents during simultaneous events. The shouted questions, emotional pleas and raucous protesters of the evening crystallized the GOP’s tough political road. In suburban Salt Lake City, local police estimated that some 1, 000 people packed into a high school auditorium to see Chaffetz as hundreds more waited outside. For 75 minutes, the congressman confronted a crowd that fumed with resentment of Trump and accused Chaffetz of coddling the President. They jeered and chanted ”Do your job!” when Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, was pressed on why his panel spent months investigating Hillary Clinton’s emails but has not yet launched inquiries into Trump’s taxes (Trump has declined to release his tax returns). Remember, this is Utah. States don’t get any redder, and it’s amazing to see that much anger bubble up from the Democratic base in a district where Chaffetz was just   by a margin of 47 percentage points. Black faced the same kind of anger that night in her ”Ask Your Reps” event in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. This is what success looks like to Indivisible. ”Success to us is every delay,” said Dohl. ”Every time we can change the narrative. Success looks exactly like the Jason Chaffetz town hall (Thursday) night.”"
"Fidel Castro, Cuban Revolutionary Who Defied U.S., Dies at 90 - The New York Times","Fidel Castro, the fiery apostle of revolution who brought the Cold War to the Western Hemisphere in 1959 and then defied the United States for nearly half a century as Cuba’s maximum leader, bedeviling 11 American presidents and briefly pushing the world to the brink of nuclear war, died on Friday. He was 90. Cuban state television announced the death but gave no other details. In declining health for several years, Mr. Castro had orchestrated what he hoped would be the continuation of his Communist revolution, stepping aside in 2006 when a serious illness felled him. He provisionally ceded much of his power to his younger brother Raúl, now 85, and two years later formally resigned as president. Raúl Castro, who had fought alongside Fidel Castro from the earliest days of the insurrection and remained minister of defense and his brother’s closest confidant, has ruled Cuba since then, although he has told the Cuban people he intends to resign in 2018. Fidel Castro had held on to power longer than any other living national leader except Queen Elizabeth II. He became a towering international figure whose importance in the 20th century far exceeded what might have been expected from the head of state of a Caribbean island nation of 11 million people. He dominated his country with strength and symbolism from the day he triumphantly entered Havana on Jan. 8, 1959, and completed his overthrow of Fulgencio Batista by delivering his first major speech in the capital before tens of thousands of admirers at the vanquished dictator’s military headquarters. A spotlight shone on him as he swaggered and spoke with passion until dawn. Finally, white doves were released to signal Cuba’s new peace. When one landed on Mr. Castro, perching on a shoulder, the crowd erupted, chanting: “Fidel! Fidel!” To the   Cubans gathered there and those watching on television, it was an electrifying sign that their young, bearded guerrilla leader was destined to be their savior. Most people in the crowd had no idea what Mr. Castro planned for Cuba. A master of image and myth, Mr. Castro believed himself to be the messiah of his fatherland, an indispensable force with authority from on high to control Cuba and its people. He wielded power like a tyrant, controlling every aspect of the island’s existence. He was Cuba’s “Máximo Lider. ” From atop a Cuban Army tank, he directed his country’s defense at the Bay of Pigs. Countless details fell to him, from selecting the color of uniforms that Cuban soldiers wore in Angola to overseeing a program to produce a superbreed of milk cows. He personally set the goals for sugar harvests. He personally sent countless men to prison. But it was more than repression and fear that kept him and his totalitarian government in power for so long. He had both admirers and detractors in Cuba and around the world. Some saw him as a ruthless despot who trampled rights and freedoms many others hailed him as the crowds did that first night, as a revolutionary hero for the ages. Even when he fell ill and was hospitalized with diverticulitis in the summer of 2006, giving up most of his powers for the first time, Mr. Castro tried to dictate the details of his own medical care and orchestrate the continuation of his Communist revolution, engaging a plan as old as the revolution itself. By handing power to his brother, Mr. Castro once more raised the ire of his enemies in Washington. United States officials condemned the transition, saying it prolonged a dictatorship and again denied the   Cuban people a chance to control their own lives. But in December 2014, President Obama used his executive powers to dial down the decades of antagonism between Washington and Havana by moving to exchange prisoners and normalize diplomatic relations between the two countries, a deal worked out with the help of Pope Francis and after 18 months of secret talks between representatives of both governments. Though increasingly frail and rarely seen in public, Mr. Castro even then made clear his enduring mistrust of the United States. A few days after Mr. Obama’s highly publicized visit to Cuba in 2016  —   the first by a sitting American president in 88 years  —   Mr. Castro penned a cranky response denigrating Mr. Obama’s overtures of peace and insisting that Cuba did not need anything the United States was offering. To many, Fidel Castro was a   zealot whose belief in his own destiny was unshakable, a chameleon whose economic and political colors were determined more by pragmatism than by doctrine. But in his chest beat the heart of a true rebel. “Fidel Castro,” said Henry M. Wriston, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations in the 1950s and early ’60s, “was everything a revolutionary should be. ” Mr. Castro was perhaps the most important leader to emerge from Latin America since the wars of independence in the early 19th century. He was decidedly the most influential shaper of Cuban history since his own hero, José Martí, struggled for Cuban independence in the late 19th century. Mr. Castro’s revolution transformed Cuban society and had a   impact throughout the region than that of any other   Latin American insurrection, with the possible exception of the 1910 Mexican Revolution. His legacy in Cuba and elsewhere has been a mixed record of social progress and abject poverty, of racial equality and political persecution, of medical advances and a degree of misery comparable to the conditions that existed in Cuba when he entered Havana as a victorious guerrilla commander in 1959. That image made him a symbol of revolution throughout the world and an inspiration to many imitators. Hugo Chávez of Venezuela considered Mr. Castro his ideological godfather. Subcommander Marcos began a revolt in the mountains of southern Mexico in 1994, using many of the same tactics. Even Mr. Castro’s spotty performance as an aging autocrat in charge of a foundering economy could not undermine his image. But beyond anything else, it was Mr. Castro’s obsession with the United States, and America’s obsession with him, that shaped his rule. After he embraced Communism, Washington portrayed him as a devil and a tyrant and repeatedly tried to remove him from power through an   invasion at the Bay of Pigs in 1961, an economic embargo that has lasted decades, assassination plots and even bizarre plans to undercut his prestige by making his beard fall out. Mr. Castro’s defiance of American power made him a beacon of resistance in Latin America and elsewhere, and his bushy beard, long Cuban cigar and green fatigues became universal symbols of rebellion. Mr. Castro’s understanding of the power of images, especially on television, helped him retain the loyalty of many Cubans even during the harshest periods of deprivation and isolation when he routinely blamed America and its embargo for many of Cuba’s ills. And his mastery of words in thousands of speeches, often lasting hours, imbued many Cubans with his own hatred of the United States by keeping them on constant watch for an invasion  —   military, economic or ideological  —   from the north. Over many years Mr. Castro gave hundreds of interviews and retained the ability to twist the most compromising question to his favor. In a 1985 interview in Playboy magazine, he was asked how he would respond to President Ronald Reagan’s description of him as a ruthless military dictator. “Let’s think about your question,” Mr. Castro said, toying with his interviewer. “If being a dictator means governing by decree, then you might use that argument to accuse the pope of being a dictator. ” He turned the question back on Reagan: “If his power includes something as monstrously undemocratic as the ability to order a thermonuclear war, I ask you, who then is more of a dictator, the president of the United States or I?” After leading his guerrillas against a repressive Cuban dictator, Mr. Castro, in his early 30s, aligned Cuba with the Soviet Union and used Cuban troops to support revolution in Africa and throughout Latin America. His willingness to allow the Soviets to build   sites in Cuba led to a harrowing diplomatic standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union in the fall of 1962, one that could have escalated into a nuclear exchange. The world remained tense until the confrontation was defused 13 days after it began, and the launching pads were dismantled. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Mr. Castro faced one of his biggest challenges: surviving without huge Communist subsidies. He defied predictions of his political demise. When threatened, he fanned antagonism toward the United States. And when the Cuban economy neared collapse, he legalized the United States dollar, which he had railed against since the 1950s, only to ban dollars again a few years later when the economy stabilized. Mr. Castro continued to taunt American presidents for a   frustrating all of Washington’s attempts to contain him. After nearly five decades as a pariah of the West, even when his once booming voice had withered to an old man’s whisper and his beard had turned gray, he remained defiant. He often told interviewers that he identified with Don Quixote, and like Quixote he struggled against threats both real and imagined, preparing for decades, for example, for another invasion that never came. As the leaders of every other nation of the hemisphere gathered in Quebec City in April 2001 for the third Summit of the Americas, an uninvited Mr. Castro, then 74, fumed in Havana, presiding over ceremonies commemorating the embarrassing defeat of C. I. A.  exiles at the Bay of Pigs in 1961. True to character, he portrayed his exclusion as a sign of strength, declaring that Cuba “is the only country in the world that does not need to trade with the United States. ” Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz was born on Aug. 13, 1926  —   1927 in some reports  —   in what was then the eastern Cuban province of Oriente, the son of a plantation owner, Ángel Castro, and one of his maids, Lina Ruz González, who became his second wife and had seven children. The father was a Spaniard who had arrived in Cuba under mysterious circumstances. One account, supported by Mr. Castro himself, was that his father had agreed to take the place of a Spanish aristocrat who had been drafted into the Spanish Army in the late 19th century to fight against Cuban independence and American hegemony. Other versions suggest that Ángel Castro went penniless to Cuba but eventually established a plantation and did business with the despised,   United Fruit Company. By the time Fidel was a youngster, his father was a major landholder. Fidel was a boisterous young student who was sent away to study with the Jesuits at the Colegio de Dolores in Santiago de Cuba and later to the Colegio de Belén, an exclusive Jesuit high school in Havana. Cuban lore has it that he was headstrong and fanatical even as a boy. In one account, Fidel was said to have bicycled   into a wall to make a point to his friends about the strength of his will. In another   tale, young Fidel and his class were led on a mountain hike by a priest. The priest slipped in a   stream and was in danger of drowning until Fidel pulled him to shore, then both knelt in prayers of thanks for their good fortune. A sense of destiny accompanied Mr. Castro as he entered the University of Havana’s law school in 1945 and almost immediately immersed himself in radical politics. He took part in an invasion of the Dominican Republic that unsuccessfully tried to oust the dictator Rafael Trujillo. He became increasingly obsessed with Cuban politics and led student protests and demonstrations even when he was not enrolled in the university. Mr. Castro’s university days earned him the image of   and seemed to support the view that he had had Communist leanings all along. But in an interview in 1981, quoted in Tad Szulc’s 1986 biography, “Fidel,” Mr. Castro said that he had flirted with Communist ideas but did not join the party. “I had entered into contact with Marxist literature,” Mr. Castro said. “At that time, there were some Communist students at the University of Havana, and I had friendly relations with them, but I was not in the Socialist Youth, I was not a militant in the Communist Party. ” He acknowledged that radical philosophy had influenced his character: “I was then acquiring a revolutionary conscience I was active I struggled, but let us say I was an independent fighter. ” After receiving his law degree, Mr. Castro briefly represented the poor, often bartering his services for food. In 1952, he ran for Congress as a candidate for the opposition Orthodox Party. But the election was scuttled because of a coup staged by Mr. Batista. Mr. Castro’s initial response to the Batista government was to challenge it with a legal appeal, claiming that Mr. Batista’s actions had violated the Constitution. Even as a symbolic act, the attempt was futile. His core group of radical students gained followers, and on July 26, 1953, Mr. Castro led them in an attack on the Moncada barracks in Santiago de Cuba. Many of the rebels were killed. The others were captured, as were Mr. Castro and his brother Raúl. At his trial, Mr. Castro defended the attack. Mr. Batista had issued an order not to discuss the proceedings, but six Cuban journalists who had been allowed in the courtroom recorded Mr. Castro’s defense. “As for me, I know that jail will be as hard as it has ever been for anyone, filled with threats, with vileness and cowardly brutality,” Mr. Castro declared. “I do not fear this, as I do not fear the fury of the miserable tyrant who snuffed out the life of 70 brothers of mine. Condemn me, it does not matter. History will absolve me. ” Mr. Castro was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Mr. Batista then made what turned out to be a huge strategic error. Believing that the rebels’ energy had been spent, and under pressure from civic leaders to show that he was not a dictator, he released Mr. Castro and his followers in an amnesty after the 1954 presidential election. Mr. Castro went into exile in Mexico, where he plotted his return to Cuba. He tried to buy a used American PT boat to carry his band to Cuba, but the deal fell through. Then he caught sight of a     wooden yacht named Granma, once owned by an American who lived in Mexico City. The Granma remains on display in Havana, encased in glass. During Mr. Castro’s long rule, his character and image underwent several transformations, beginning with his days as a revolutionary in the Sierra Maestra of eastern Cuba. After arriving on the coast in the overloaded yacht with Che Guevara and 80 of their comrades in December 1956, Mr. Castro took on the role of freedom fighter. He engaged in a campaign of harassment and guerrilla warfare that infuriated Mr. Batista, who had seized power in a 1952 garrison revolt, ending a brief period of democracy. Although his soldiers and weapons vastly outnumbered Mr. Castro’s, Mr. Batista grew fearful of the young guerrilla’s mesmerizing oratory. He ordered government troops not to rest until they had killed Mr. Castro, and the army frequently reported that it had done so. Newspapers around the world reported his death in the December 1956 landing. But three months later, Mr. Castro was interviewed for a series of articles that would revive his movement and thus change history. The escapade began when Castro loyalists contacted a correspondent and editorial writer for The New York Times, Herbert L. Matthews, and arranged for him to interview Mr. Castro. A few Castro supporters took Mr. Matthews into the mountains disguised as a wealthy American planter. Drawing on his reporting, Mr. Matthews wrote sympathetically of both the man and his movement, describing Mr. Castro, then 30, parting the jungle leaves and striding into a clearing for the interview. “This was quite a man  —   a powerful       with a straggly beard,” Mr. Matthews wrote. The three articles, which began in The Times on Sunday, Feb. 24, 1957, presented a Castro that Americans could root for. “The personality of the man is overpowering,” Mr. Matthews wrote. “Here was an educated, dedicated fanatic, a man of ideals, of courage and of remarkable qualities of leadership. ” The articles repeated Mr. Castro’s assertions that Cuba’s future was anything but a Communist state. “He has strong ideas of liberty, democracy, social justice, the need to restore the Constitution, to hold elections,” Mr. Matthews wrote. When asked about the United States, Mr. Castro replied, “You can be sure we have no animosity toward the United States and the American people. ” The Cuban government denounced Mr. Matthews and called the articles fabrications. But the news that he had survived the landing breathed life into Mr. Castro’s movement. His small band of irregulars skirmished with government troops, and each encounter increased their support in Cuba and around the world, even though other insurgent forces in the cities were also fighting to overthrow the Batista government. It was the symbolic strength of his movement, not the armaments under Mr. Castro’s control, that overwhelmed the government. By the time Mr. Batista fled from a darkened Havana airport just after midnight on New Year’s Day 1959, Mr. Castro was already a legend. Competing opposition groups were unable to seize power. Events over the next few months became the catalyst for another transformation in Mr. Castro’s public image. More than 500   officials were brought before   and special tribunals, summarily convicted and shot to death. The grainy    images of the executions broadcast on American television horrified viewers. Mr. Castro defended the executions as necessary to solidify the revolution. He complained that the United States had raised not a whimper when Mr. Batista had tortured and executed thousands of opponents. But to wary observers in the United States, the executions were a signal that Mr. Castro was not the democratic savior he had seemed. In May 1959, he began confiscating privately owned agricultural land, including land owned by Americans, openly provoking the United States government. In the spring of 1960, Mr. Castro ordered American and British refineries in Cuba to accept oil from the Soviet Union. Under pressure from Congress, President Dwight D. Eisenhower cut the American sugar quota from Cuba, forcing Mr. Castro to look for new markets. He turned to the Soviet Union for economic aid and political support. Thus began a   of American antagonism toward Cuba. Finally, in 1961, he gave the United States 48 hours to reduce the staff of its embassy in Havana to 18 from 60. A frustrated Eisenhower broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba and closed the embassy on the Havana seacoast. The diplomatic stalemate lasted until 2015, when embassies were finally reopened in both Havana and Washington. During his two years in the mountains, Mr. Castro had sketched a social revolution whose aim, at least on the surface, seemed to be to restore the democracy that Mr. Batista’s coup had stifled. Mr. Castro promised free elections and vowed to end American domination of the economy and the   oppression that he said it had caused. Despite having a law degree, Mr. Castro had no real experience in economics or government. Beyond improving education and reducing Cuba’s dependence on sugar and the United States, his revolution began without a clear sense of the new society he planned, except that it would be different from what had existed under Mr. Batista. At the time, Cuba was a playground for rich American tourists and gangsters where glaring disparities of wealth persisted, although the country was one of the most economically advanced in the Caribbean. After taking power in 1959, Mr. Castro put together a cabinet of moderates, but it did not last long. He named Felipe Pazos, an economist, president of the Banco Nacional de Cuba, Cuba’s central bank. But when Mr. Pazos openly criticized Mr. Castro’s growing tolerance of Communists and his failure to restore democracy, he was dismissed. In place of Mr. Pazos, Mr. Castro named Che Guevara, an Argentine doctor who knew nothing about monetary policy but whose revolutionary credentials were unquestioned. Opposition to the Castro government began to grow in Cuba, leading peasants and   insurgents to take up arms against it. The Escambray Revolt, as it was called, lasted from 1959 to 1965, when it was crushed by Mr. Castro’s army. As the first waves of Cuban exiles arrived in Miami and northern New Jersey after the revolution, many were intent on overthrowing the man they had once supported. Their number would eventually total a million, many from what had been, proportionately, the largest middle class in Latin America. The Central Intelligence Agency helped train an exile army to retake Cuba by force. The army was to make a beachhead at the Bay of Pigs, a remote spot on Cuba’s southern coast, and instigate a popular insurrection. Mr. Szulc, then a correspondent for The Times, had picked up information about the invasion, and had written an article about it. But The Times, at the request of the Kennedy administration, withheld some of what Mr. Szulc had found, including information that an attack was imminent. Specific references to the C. I. A. were also omitted. Ten days later, on April 17, 1961, 1, 500 Cuban fighters landed at the Bay of Pigs. Mr. Castro was waiting for them. The invasion was badly planned and by all accounts doomed. Most of the invaders were either captured or killed. Promised American air support never arrived. The historian Theodore Draper called the botched operation “a perfect failure,” and the invasion aroused a distrust of the United States that Mr. Castro exploited for political gain for the rest of his life. The C. I. A. fighting the Cold War, had acted out of worries about Mr. Castro’s increasingly open Communist connections. As he consolidated power, even some of his most faithful supporters grew concerned. One break had taken place as early as 1959. Huber Matos, who had fought alongside Mr. Castro in the Sierra Maestra, resigned as military governor of Camagüey Province to protest the Communists’ growing influence as well as the appointment of Raúl Castro, whose Communist sympathies were well known, as commander of Cuba’s armed forces. Suspecting an antirevolutionary plot, Fidel Castro had Mr. Matos arrested and charged with treason. Within two months, Mr. Matos was tried, convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison. When he was released in 1979, Mr. Matos, nearly blind, went into exile in the United States, where he lived until his death in 2014. Shortly after arriving in Miami and joining the legions of Castro opponents there, Mr. Matos told Worldview magazine: “I differed from Fidel Castro because the original objective of our revolution was ‘Freedom or Death.’ Once Castro had power, he began to kill freedom. ” It was not until just before the Bay of Pigs invasion that Mr. Castro declared publicly that his revolution was socialist. A few months later, on Dec. 2, 1961, he removed any lingering doubt about his loyalties when he affirmed in a long speech, “I am a  . ” Many Cubans who had willingly accepted great sacrifice for what they believed would be a democratic revolution were dismayed. They broke ranks with Mr. Castro, putting themselves and their families at risk. Others, from the safety of the United States, publicly accused Mr. Castro of betraying the revolution and called him a tyrant. Even his family began to raise doubts about his intentions. “As I listened, I thought that surely he must be a superb actor,” Mr. Castro’s sister Juanita wrote in an account in Life magazine in 1964, referring to the December 1961 speech. “He had fooled not only so many of his friends, but his family as well. ” She recalled his upbringing as the son of a    landowner in eastern Cuba who had sent him to exclusive Jesuit schools. In 1948, after Mr. Castro married Mirta   whose family had ties to the Batista government, his father gave them a   honeymoon in the United States. “How could Fidel, who had been given the best of everything, be a Communist?” Juanita Castro wrote. “This was the riddle which paralyzed me and so many other Cubans who refused to believe that he was leading our country into the Communist camp. ” Although the young Fidel was deeply involved in a radical student movement at the University of Havana, his early allegiance to Communist doctrine was uncertain at best. Some analysts believed that the obstructionist attitudes of American officials had pushed Mr. Castro toward the Soviet Union. Indeed, although Mr. Castro pursued ideologically communist policies, he never established a purely Communist state in Cuba, nor did he adopt orthodox Communist Party ideology. Rather, what developed in Cuba was less doctrinaire, a tropical form of communism that suited his needs. He centralized the economy and flattened out much of the traditional hierarchy of Cuban society, improving education and health care for many Cubans, while depriving them of free speech and economic opportunity. But unlike other Communist countries, Cuba was never governed by a functioning politburo Mr. Castro himself, and later his brother Rául, filled all the important positions in the party, the government and the army, ruling Cuba as its maximum leader. “The Cuban regime turns out to be simply the case of a   dictator seizing a useful ideology in order to employ its wealth against his enemies,” wrote the columnist Georgie Anne Geyer, whose critical biography of Mr. Castro was published in 1991. In this view of Mr. Castro, he was above all an   Spanish caudillo, one of a long line of Latin American strongmen who endeared themselves to people searching for leaders. The analyst Alvaro Vargas Llosa of the Independent Institute in Washington called him “the ultimate   caudillo. ” In Cuba, through good times and bad, Mr. Castro’s supporters referred to themselves not as Communists but as Fidelistas. He remained personally popular among segments of Cuban society even after his economic policies created severe hardship. As Mr. Castro consolidated power, eliminated his enemies and grew increasingly autocratic, the Cuban people referred to him simply as Fidel. To say “Castro” was considered disloyal, although in later decades Cubans would commonly say just that and mean it. Or they would invoke his overwhelming presence by simply bringing a hand to their chins, as if to stroke a beard. Mr. Castro’s alignment with the Soviet Union meant that the Cold War between the world’s superpowers, and the ideological battle between democracy and communism, had erupted in the United States’ sphere of influence. A clash was all but inevitable, and it came in October 1962. American spy planes took reconnaissance photos suggesting that the Soviets had exploited their new alliance to build bases in Cuba for   nuclear missiles capable of reaching North America. Mr. Castro allowed the bases to be constructed, but once they were discovered, he became a bit player in the ensuing drama, overshadowed by President John F. Kennedy and the Soviet leader, Nikita S. Khrushchev. Kennedy put United States military forces on alert and ordered a naval blockade of Cuba. The two sides were at a stalemate for 13 tense days, and the world held its breath. Finally, after receiving assurances that the United States would remove American missiles from Turkey and not invade Cuba, the Soviets withdrew the missiles and dismantled the bases. But the Soviet presence in Cuba continued to grow. Soviet troops, technicians and engineers streamed in, eventually producing a generation of blond Cubans with names like Yuri, Alexi and Vladimiro. The Soviets were willing to buy all the sugar Cuba could produce. Even as other Caribbean nations diversified, Cuba decided to stick with one major crop, sugar, and one major buyer. But after forcing the entire nation into a failed effort to reach a record    sugar harvest in 1970, Mr. Castro recognized the need to break the cycle of dependence on the Soviets and sugar. Once more, he relied on his belief in himself and his revolution for solutions. One unlikely consequence was his effort to develop a Cuban supercow. Although he had no training in animal husbandry, Mr. Castro decided to crossbreed humpbacked Asian Zebus with standard Holsteins to create a new breed that could produce milk at prodigious rates. Decades later, the Zebus could still be found grazing in pastures across the island, symbols of Mr. Castro’s micromanagement. A few of the hybrids did give more milk, and one that set a milk production record was stuffed and placed in a museum. But most were no better producers than their parents. As the Soviets settled in Cuba in the 1960s, hundreds of Cuban students were sent to Moscow, Prague and other cities of the Soviet bloc to study science and medicine. Admirers from around the world, including some Americans, were impressed with the way that health care and literacy in Cuba had improved. A reshaping of Cuban society was underway. Cuba’s tradition of racial segregation was turned upside down as peasants from the countryside, many of them   descendants of Africans enslaved by the Spaniards centuries before, were invited into Havana and other cities that had been overwhelmingly white. They were given the keys to the elegant homes and spacious apartments of the   Cubans who had fled to the United States. Rents came to be little more than symbolic, and basic foods like milk and eggs were sold in government stores at below production cost. Mr. Castro’s early overhauls also changed Cuba in ways that were less than utopian.   priests were exiled, and local clergy were harassed so much that many closed their churches. The Roman Catholic Church excommunicated Mr. Castro for violating a 1949 papal decree against supporting Communism. He established a sinister system of local Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, which set neighbors to informing on neighbors. Thousands of dissidents and homosexuals were rounded up and sentenced to either prison or forced labor. And although blacks were welcomed into the cities, Mr. Castro’s government remained overwhelmingly white. Mr. Castro regularly fanned the flames of revolution with his oratory. In marathon speeches, he incited the Cuban people by laying out what he considered the evils of capitalism in general and of the United States in particular. For decades, the regime controlled all publications and broadcasting outlets and restricted access to goods and information in ways that would not have been possible if Cuba were not an island. His revolution established at home, Mr. Castro looked to export it. Thousands of Cuban soldiers were sent to Africa to fight in Angola, Mozambique and Ethiopia in support of Communist insurgents. The strain on Cuba’s treasury and its society was immense, but Mr. Castro insisted on being a global player in the Communist struggle. As potential threats to his rule were eliminated, Mr. Castro tightened his grip. Camilo Cienfuegos, who had led a division in the insurrection and was immensely popular in Cuba, was killed in a plane crash days after going to arrest Huber Matos in Camagüey on Mr. Castro’s orders. His body was never found. Che Guevara, who had become hostile toward the Soviet Union, broke with Mr. Castro before going off to Bolivia, where he was captured and killed in 1967 for trying to incite a revolution there. Despite the fiery rhetoric from Mr. Castro in the early years of the revolution, Washington did attempt a reconciliation. By some accounts, in the weeks before he was assassinated in 1963, Kennedy had aides look at mending fences, providing Mr. Castro was willing to break with the Soviets. But with Kennedy’s assassination, and suspicions that Mr. Castro and the Cubans were somehow involved, the 90 miles separating Cuba from the United States became a gulf of antagonism and mistrust. The C. I. A. tried several times to eliminate Mr. Castro or undermine his authority. One plot involved exposing him to a chemical that would cause his beard to fall out, and another using a poison pen to kill him. Mr. Castro often boasted of how many times he had escaped C. I. A. plots to kill him, and he ordered information about the foiled attempts to be put on display at a Havana museum. Relations between the United States and Cuba briefly thawed in the 1970s during the administration of President Jimmy Carter. For the first time,   were allowed to visit family in Havana under strict guidelines. But that fleeting détente ended in 1980 when Mr. Castro tried to defuse growing domestic discontent by allowing about 125, 000 Cubans to flee in boats, makeshift rafts and inner tubes, departing from the beach at Mariel. He used the opportunity to empty Cuban prisons of criminals and people with mental illnesses and force them to join the Mariel boatlift. Mr. Carter’s successor, Reagan, slammed shut the door that Mr. Carter had opened. In 1989, when frustrated veterans from Cuba’s African ventures began rallying around Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa, who led Cuban forces on the continent, Mr. Castro effectively got rid of a potential rival by bringing the general and some of his supporters to trial on drug charges. General Ochoa and several other   officers were executed on the orders of Raúl Castro, who was then the minister of defense. The United States economic embargo, imposed by Eisenhower and widened by Kennedy, has continued for more than five decades. But its effectiveness was undermined by the Soviet Union, which gave Cuba $5 billion a year in subsidies, and later by Venezuela, which sent Cuba badly needed oil and   economic support. Most other countries, including close United States allies like Canada, maintained relations with Cuba throughout the decades and continued trading with the island. In recent years, successive American presidents have punched big holes in the embargo, allowing a broad range of economic activity, though maintaining the ban on tourism. “I faced my greatest challenge after I turned 60,” Mr. Castro said in an interview with Vanity Fair magazine in 1994. He was referring to the collapse of the Soviet empire, which brought an end to the subsidies that had kept his government afloat for so long. He had also lost a steady source of oil and a reliable buyer for Cuban sugar. Abandoned, isolated, facing increasing dissent at home, Mr. Castro seemed to have come to the end of his line. Cuba’s collapse appeared imminent, and Mr. Castro’s final hours in power were widely anticipated. Miami exiles began making elaborate preparations for a triumphant return. But Mr. Castro, defying predictions, fought on. He chose an unlikely weapon: the hated American dollar, which he had long condemned as the corrupt symbol of capitalism. In the summer of 1993, he made it legal for Cubans to hold American dollars spent by tourists or sent by exiled family members. That policy eventually led to a dual currency system that has fostered resentment and hampered economic development in Cuba. Mr. Castro, the     was also willing to experiment with capitalism and free enterprise, at least for a time. Encouraged by his brother Raúl, he allowed farmers to sell excess produce at market rates, and he ordered officials to turn a blind eye to small,   kitchens and restaurants, called paladares, that charged market prices. Under Rául Castro, those reforms were broadened considerably, though they were sometimes met with public grumbling from his older brother. But despite his apparent distaste for capitalism, and lingering memories of the 1950s Cuba that preceded his rule, Fidel Castro continued to foster Cuba’s tourism industry. He allowed Spanish, Italian and Canadian companies to develop resort hotels and vacation properties, usually in association with an arm of the Cuban military. For many years, the resorts were off limits to most Cubans. They generated hard cash, but a new generation of struggling young Cuban women were lured into prostitution by the tourists’ money. For a time, Mexican and Canadian investors poured money into the decrepit telephone company (owned by ITT until it was nationalized by Mr. Castro in 1960) mining operations and other enterprises, which helped keep Cuba’s economy from collapsing. He declared an emergency during which he expected the Cuban people to tighten their belts. He called the United States embargo genocide. All his efforts were not enough to keep dissent from sprouting in Havana, Santiago de Cuba and other urban areas during this period of hardship. Despite worldwide condemnation of his actions, Mr. Castro clamped down on a fledgling democracy movement, jailing anyone who dared to call for free elections. He also cracked down on the nucleus of an independent press, imprisoning or harassing Cuban reporters and editors. In 1994, for the first time, demonstrators took to the streets of Havana to express their anger over the failed promises of the revolution. Mr. Castro had to personally appeal for calm. Then, in early 1996, he seized an opportunity to rebuild his support by again demonizing the United States. A South Florida group, Brothers to the Rescue, had been flying three civilian planes toward the Cuban coast when two were shot down by Cuban military jets. Four men on board were killed. Mr. Castro raged against Washington, maintaining that the planes had violated Cuban airspace. American officials condemned the attack. Until then, President Bill Clinton had been moving discreetly but steadily toward easing the United States embargo and   some relations with Cuba. But in the wake of the attack, and the virulent reaction from   in Florida  —   a state Mr. Clinton considered important to his   bid  —   he reluctantly signed the   law, which allowed the United States to punish foreign companies that were using confiscated American property in Cuba. The State Department’s first warnings under the new law went to a Canadian mining company that had taken over a huge nickel mine, and a Mexican investment group that had purchased the Cuban telephone company. Despite protests from American allies, the United States maintained the   law as a weapon against Mr. Castro, although all its provisions have never been carried out. But in Cuba, the American actions reinforced Mr. Castro’s complaints about American arrogance and helped channel domestic dissent toward Washington. One of his strengths as a communicator  —   he considered Reagan his only worthy competitor in that regard  —   had always been to transform his anger toward the United States into a rallying cry for the Cuban people. “We are left with the honor of being one of the few adversaries of the United States,” Mr. Castro told Maria Shriver of NBC in a 1998 interview. When Ms. Shriver asked him if that truly was an honor, he answered, “Of course. ” “For such a small country as Cuba to have such a gigantic country as the United States live so obsessed with this island,” he said, “it is an honor for us. ” As he grew older and grayer, Mr. Castro could no longer be easily linked to the intense guerrilla fighter who had come out of the Sierra Maestra. He rambled incoherently in his long speeches. He was rumored to be suffering from various diseases. After 40 years, the revolution he started no longer held promise, and Cubans by the thousands, including many who had never known any other life but under Mr. Castro, risked their lives trying to reach the United States on rafts, inner tubes and even old trucks outfitted with floats. Although the revolution lost its luster, what never diminished was Mr. Castro’s ability to confound American officials and to create situations to seize the advantage of a particular moment. That was evident early in 1998 when Pope John Paul II visited Havana and met with Mr. Castro. The meeting was widely expected to be seen as a rebuke and an embarrassment to Mr. Castro. The aging   pontiff stood beside the aging Communist leader, who had abandoned his military uniform for the occasion in favor of a dark suit. The pope talked about human rights and the lack of basic freedoms in Cuba. But he also called Washington’s embargo “unjust and ethically unacceptable,” allowing Mr. Castro to claim a political if not a moral victory. The next year, Mr. Castro converted another conflict into an opportunity to bolster his standing among his own people while infuriating the United States. A young woman and her    son were among more than a dozen Cubans who had set out for Florida in a   aluminum boat. The boat capsized and the woman drowned, but the boy, Elián González, survived two days in an inner tube before being picked up by the United States Coast Guard and taken to Miami, where he was united with relatives. Later, however, the relatives refused to release the boy when his father, in Cuba, demanded his return. The standoff between the family and United States officials created the kind of emotional and political drama that Mr. Castro had become a master at manipulating for his own purposes. Mr. Castro made the boy another symbol of American oppression, which diverted attention from the deteriorating conditions in Cuba. After several months, American agents seized the boy from his Miami relatives and returned him to his father in Cuba, where he was greeted by Mr. Castro. That episode carried great significance for Mr. Castro in the way it echoed one in his personal life. Mr. Castro and his wife, Mirta   divorced in 1955, six years after the birth of their son, Fidelito. In 1956, when Mr. Castro and Ms.   were both in Mexico, Mr. Castro arranged to have the boy visit him before embarking on what he said would be a dangerous voyage, which turned out to be his invasion of Cuba. He promised to bring the boy back in two weeks, but it was a trick. At the end of that period, Mr. Castro placed Fidelito in the custody of a friend in Mexico City. He then sailed for Cuba with his fellow rebels on the yacht Granma. The boy’s mother, with the help of her family and the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City, found a team of professional kidnappers, who ambushed the boy and his guardians in a park and carried him off. Ms.   took Fidelito to New York and enrolled him in a local school for a year. But after Mr. Castro entered Havana and grabbed control of the government, he persuaded his former wife to send the boy back. The younger Mr. Castro lived in Cuba until, years later, he was sent to the Soviet Union to study. He became a physicist, married a Russian woman and eventually returned to Cuba, where he was named head of Cuba’s nuclear power program. Details of Mr. Castro’s personal life were always murky. He had no formal home but lived in many different houses and estates in and around Havana. He had relationships with several women, and only in his later years was he willing to acknowledge that he had a relationship of more than 40 years with Dalia Soto del Valle, who had rarely been seen in public. (Whether they were legally married was not clear.) The two had five sons  —   Alexis, Alexander, Alejandro, Antonio and Ángel  —   all of whom live in Cuba. Mr. Castro also has a daughter, Alina, a radio host in Miami, who bitterly attacked her father on the air for years. Mr. Castro had stormy relations with many of his relatives both in Cuba and the United States. He remained close to Celia Sánchez, a woman who was with him in the Sierra Maestra and who looked after his schedule and his archives devotedly, until she died in 1980. A sister, Ángela Castro, died at 88 in Havana in February 2012, according to The Associated Press, quoting her sister Juanita. And his elder brother Ramón died in February 2016 at 91. Outlasting all his enemies, Mr. Castro lived to rule a country where the overwhelming majority of people had never known any other leader. Hardly anyone talked openly of a time without him until the day, in 2001, when he appeared to faint while giving a speech. Then, in 2004, he stumbled while leaving a platform, breaking a kneecap and reminding Cubans again of his mortality and forcing them to confront their future. As Mr. Castro and his revolution aged, Cuban dissidents grew bolder. Oswaldo Payá, using a clause in the Cuban Constitution, collected thousands of signatures in a petition demanding a referendum on free speech and other political freedoms. (Mr. Payá died in a car crash in 2012.) Bloggers wrote disparagingly of Mr. Castro and the regime, although most of their missives could not be read in Cuba, where internet access was strictly limited. A group of Cuban women who called themselves the Ladies in White rallied on Sundays to protest the imprisonment of their fathers, husbands and sons, whose pictures they carried on posters inscribed with the number of years to which they were sentenced as political prisoners. After being made his brother’s successor, Raúl Castro tried to control the fragments of the revolution that remained after Fidel Castro fell ill, including a close association with President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, who modeled himself after Fidel. (Mr. Chávez died in 2013.) Never as popular as his brother, Raúl Castro was considered a better manager, and in some ways was seen as more conscious of the everyday needs of the Cuban people, despite his reputation as the revolution’s executioner. One of his first moves as leader was to replace the grossly overcrowded city buses, known as “camels,” with new ones, many imported from China. He opened up the economy somewhat, allowing entrepreneurs to start businesses, and he eased restrictions on traveling, access to cellphones, computers and other personal items, and the buying and selling of property. Still, Raúl Castro came under mounting pressure from Cubans demanding even more economic and political opportunity. He took more steps to open the economy and, in so doing, dismantled parts of the socialist state that his brother had defended for so long. Lurking in the background as Raúl Castro embarked on that new course was the brooding visage of Fidel, whose revolution has been seen as a rebellion of one man. When President Obama and Raúl Castro simultaneously went on TV in their countries in 2014 to announce a prisoner exchange and the first steps toward normalizing relations, Cubans and Americans alike expected to hear Fidel either accepting or condemning the moves. Six weeks after the deal was announced, Mr. Castro, or someone writing in his name, finally reacted in a way that combined his own bluster and his brother’s new approach. “I do not trust the politics of the United States, nor have I exchanged a word with them, but this is not, in any way, a rejection of a peaceful solution to conflicts,” Mr. Castro wrote near the end of a rambling letter to students on the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of his own time at the University of Havana. Sounding more like his brother than his old self, he backed any peaceful attempts to resolve the problems between the two countries. He then took one final swipe at his old nemesis. “The grave dangers that threaten humanity today have to give way to norms that are compatible with human dignity,” the letter said. “No country is excluded from such rights. With this spirit I have fought, and will continue fighting, until my last breath. ” In April 2016, a frail Mr. Castro made what many thought would be his last public appearance, at the Seventh Congress of the Cuban Communist Party. Dressed in an incongruous blue tracksuit jacket, his hands at times quivering and his once powerful voice reduced to a tinny squawk, he expressed surprise at having survived to almost 90, and he bade farewell to the party, the political system and the revolutionary Cuba he had created. “Soon I will be like everybody else,” Mr. Castro said. “Our turn comes to us all, but the ideas of Cuban communism will endure. ” No one is sure if the force of the revolution will dissipate without Mr. Castro and, eventually, his brother. But Fidel Castro’s impact on Latin America and the Western Hemisphere has the earmarks of lasting indefinitely. The power of his personality remains inescapable, for better or worse, not only in Cuba but also throughout Latin America. “We are going to live with Fidel Castro and all he stands for while he is alive,” wrote Mr. Matthews of The Times, whose own fortunes were dimmed considerably by his connection to Mr. Castro, “and with his ghost when he is dead. ”"

Rep Green: After ’Reviewing Evidence’ I Felt ’Compelled’ to Call For Trump’s Impeachment - Breitbart,"Monday on MSNBC, while discussing his call on the floor of the U. S. House of Representatives for President Donald Trump to be impeached, Rep. Al Green ( ) declared he did so because he “felt compelled” after reviewing evidence.  Green said, “This is not something that I wanted to do, sir, it’s something that I felt compelled to do after reviewing evidence. We live in a country where we believe no police officer, no congressman, no senator and no president is above the law. When the President decided that he would fire the FBI director who was investigating his campaign, which means that he was investigating him, the president, when he decided to fire him and he acknowledged that he was doing it for this reason, when you couple that with the fact that he said that the Russian thing was a   story and he said it is a   and then he went on to tweet something that may be considered an intimidating statement with reference to a recording that he might have, when you combine these things you have obstruction of justice.

Picture of teen at Target goes viral," (CNN) Turns out, talking to strangers is not so bad after all.  At least for a North Carolina teen, who went to Target to look for a   tie for a job interview. Instead, he became the subject of a touching moment and a viral photo. Audrey Mark told CNN affiliate WTVD she was shopping at a store in Raleigh on Wednesday when she noticed something unusual.  ”I see this young teen being hovered over by this Target employee,” Mark said.  Curious, she got closer to see what was going on. The employee was not just tying the teen’s tie, he was imparting some wisdom as well.  ”I hear him peppering him with all this advice on interview skills and handshakes,” she told the affiliate.  Employee Cathy Scott said the teen walked into the store looking for a tie.  ”I asked him if he needed help, and he told me he needed   ties,” Scott told the affiliate. ”We didn’t have any.” She turned to her   Dennis Roberts, and asked him if he knew how to tie a regular tie. He said yes, so the teen bought one and handed it to Roberts. But Scott and Roberts went a step further and prepared the teen for his interview. ”We said, ’Make sure you look him in the eye.’ I’m saying, ’Make sure you give him a firm handshake,’ and she showed him . .. he tucked his shirt in,” Roberts said.   Mark snapped away. ”It was a very quiet, simple moment, but it was very profound,” she told the affiliate. ”He leaves and all these Target employees are screaming ’Bye! Good luck! Tell us how it went.’ I got so emotional. I got teary.”  But it didn’t just end there. A day later, a Target team went to a nearby    where the teen interviewed, according to the affiliate.  Though they didn’t know his identity, they shared their experience with the restaurant’s manager. The teen appears to have had a good initial interview at the restaurant. He’s 15 and ”definitely left a memorable impression,” said David Langston, operator of the   .  ”We have a   interview process, and we are inviting him back to have his second interview,” Langston said. ”He’s a really nice kid. We hope to talk to him today (Friday) but we have to wait until he gets out of school and check his availability to set up the second interview.”"
Miley Cyrus: Hillary Clinton ‘A Total Goddess’,"Appearing as a guest on Ellen DeGeneres’ show Wednesday, pop singer Miley Cyrus gushed about Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton: “I think she’s a total goddess and I just love her. ”[Cyrus, 23, who has recently been stumping for Clinton in Washington, D. C. and at George Mason University in Virginia, said about her appearance at the school:  You listen to so many people, especially when you’re watching the debates, specifically Trump, say so many dumb things, and these young kids were so smart and so amazing to talk to them, not why we should just be terrified of the other option  —   it wasn’t about what a horrible guy Trump is  —   nasty guy Trump is. It was really about what a great woman she is. And we would choose her no matter what it would be, who she was up against. So, I really think it was incredible to hear the young people say why they’re voting for her. “There will be more people voting in this election than in any election before,” DeGeneres said. “That’s what we really, really hope,” Cyrus added. “We need everyone to register,” pleaded DeGeneres. “We need everyone to go out. ” Cyrus said she actively stumped for Clinton because she had openly supported Bernie Sanders in the primary, and wanted to speak to those people who are now undecided about voting for Clinton. “Which I find ridiculous,” she said, “because in life we don’t always get the choices that we want. We don’t always get what we want, and so you do with what you have. ” “And these are your choices, and it’s terrifying if someone besides Hillary Clinton  —   we shouldn’t even say the name  —   becomes president,” Cyrus added. “So I think she’s a total goddess, and I just love her. And I’m really excited to see her for the next four  —   maybe eight  —   years. ” “I hope you’re right,” DeGeneres responded, expressing concern that many Sanders supporters are still not committing to vote for Clinton. Cyrus said she saw Sanders supporters protesting when she visited Washington, D. C. and emphasized that she backed him originally because, unlike Clinton, he has always been an LGBT supporter. “I think, like Hillary  —   I think she’s grown, and that’s what it is,” she continued. “We should celebrate progress and not perfection. ”"

Report: Donald Trump’s 2018 Budget Request Seeks $2.6 Billion For Border Infrastructure - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump will ask Congress next Tuesday to provide $2. 6 billion in the September budget deal for border infrastructure in 2018, including the construction of new border walls, according to details provided to the New York Times. [According to the report:  According to officials, $1. 6 billion of that money would go toward materials to build the wall. That would initially be used for continuing the levy [sic] wall in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas and replacing existing fencing in El Paso and in San Diego. The Times‘ report did not explain how many extra miles of border fences or walls would be built, or even how much of the money would be spent building a fence or wall, but it did report that: the government intends to buy all sorts of equipment that will supplement or substitute for a physical wall. The budget request will allocate $239 million for aircraft and aviation sensors $197 million for fixed surveillance technology, including towers, radar and cameras and $202 million for what it described as “critical equipment” such as radios, computers and weapons   …     [plus] $111 million allocated for roads to gain access to parts of the border that are now hard to reach. “Levee wall” is a term for strong   walls alongside rivers, particularly along the Rio Grande river which marks the border with Mexico. Trump’s primary promise in his 2016 campaign was the construction of the border wall, which is being desperately resisted by legislators who went to preserve the northward flow of roughly 550, 000 illegal immigrant workers and customers per year up to businesses and donors in their districts. However, illegal immigration has less of an impact on Americans than does the federal government’s policy of inflating the new labor supply by roughly 25 percent. Each year, four million young Americans enter the labor force,  but the federal government also invites 1 million legal immigrants and 1 million temporary workers to compete for jobs against Americans. Also, legislators in Congress have proposed many bills to further increase the legal inflow of foreign workers. The $2. 6 billion request “seems less ambition, there’s no question about it,” said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. The modest request may suggest they are trying to reduce opposition from Democrats in Congress, Krikorian added. “Maybe they’re trying to come up with something that [Democratic leader Chuck] Schumer won’t shut down the government over  …     but there’s no reason Schumer won’t threaten a government shutdown in September over wall funding  —   he did that in April and he got away with it. ” The modest request may suggest they are trying to reduce opposition from Democrats in Congress, Krikorian added. “Maybe they’re trying to come up with something that [Democratic leader Chuck] Schumer won’t shut down the government over  …     but there’s no reason Schumer won’t threaten a government shutdown in September over wall funding  —   he did that in April and he got away with it. ” “On the other hand, there is a lot of   to buy if you are going to do more wall construction, and maybe [White House officials] are figuring it is not worth asking for money for construction until they have purchased the land,” he added. Trump is also asking to boost the Pentagon’s 2018 budget by $52 billion, which will be used to buy extra aircraft and ships. In March, Trump asked for $1 billion to quickly build an extra 48 miles of border fence during 2017. But Democrats threatened to shut down funding until the budget request was rejected, GOP legislators refused to fight for any money to build a wall, and so the May budget supplemental included no funds for new wall construction. In   a White House official predicted the administration would ask for $2. 6 billion for “border protections” in the budget request for 2018. Most   immigration reformers say border fences are better than new surveillance technology, which is expensive to buy and maintain and is also easily removed by future spending cuts. If Trump wants to Congress to fund his border wall, he has to start fighting now, said Krikorian. “They need to start making the case now because it takes time to build political momentum for something, and the fight over wall funding in September is going to be a political fight,” he said. “This is an important issue for Trump politically, and he needs to follow through because even those people who tell people they are not for the wall are not against the wall  —   only a kooky fringe are opposed categorically to the wall,” he added. citing the April comment by Democratic Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi that “the wall is, in my view, immoral, expensive, unwise, and when the president says, ‘Well, I promised a wall during my campaign.’ I don’t think he said he was going to pass billions of dollars of cost of the wall on to the taxpayer. ” “Make Nancy and her kooky moral opposition to border enforcement the face of those who are opposing the budget request,” Krikorian suggested.

London’s secret underground railway,"London (CNN) Five years ago, some young   went underground in London.  Collectively dubbing themselves ”Consolidation Crew,” individually with names like ”Urban Fox” and ”Silent Motion,” their mission was to ”explore everything.” What they did and still do is ”place hack”    in other words, trespass on other people’s property.  In 2011, they made ”an epic discovery of the highest order”    a ”silent nocturnal city” some 25 meters (80 feet) below the streets of London, where the air was so still that calcium stalactites had formed. It felt, they wrote, ’”like we were in an Indiana Jones movie    hot, sweaty and dank.” Urban Fox and company went down a steep iron spiral staircase and into a series of extraordinary miniature   tunnels. Just as they had hoped, they’d found the defunct British Post Office underground railway network    the   ”Mail Train.” The line runs along Oxford Street, under the department store Selfridges and Cavendish Square, and snakes along for ten kilometers from Paddington in West London to Whitechapel in the East End.  For trainspotters, this was a fabulous, almost mythical slice of railwayana    ”the least documented railway line this side of the old Iron Curtain.” Only Post Office staff ever went down to these secret subterranean tunnels, where the world’s first driverless electric trains rattled back and forth at speeds of up to 55 kph (35 mph) for most of the 20th century. London’s underground legacy, Londoners have long been pioneers in building underground, usually out of necessity.  The Victorians began it after the cholera epidemic of   and ”The Great Stink” of 1858, an elaborate sewer system was built under the city designed by the ”Sewer King,” Joseph Bazalgette. ”The Tube” begun in 1863 as direct response to traffic congestion and was the world’s first underground railway system. Steam locomotives first ran on the Metropolitan Line with air so noxious it was likened to crocodile breath. Moving mail underground in London also started in the   century.  In 1861, a private company set up a   pneumatic tube system. Basically, a steam engine powered a large fan into a narrow tube: carriages were blown one way, then dragged back the other way by suction. Getting into a pneumatic carriage    as some test engineers did    must have been like jumping into a modern   bobsleigh.   In 1865, the Illustrated London News reported on the launch of a pneumatic line under Euston Station,   Victorians looking on earnestly at this wonder of the age. But after multiple experiments, it failed to attract investors and in 1908, British Post Office engineers visited Chicago to look at its new freight subway system    a labyrinth of tunnels   under the city’s famous Loop for almost 100 kilometers (60 miles).  The British visitors were deeply impressed the General Post Office    then a government department    decided that it would also go underground and electric something had to be done to avoid the heavy, largely   London traffic of the early 1900s. A haven for priceless art, The Post Office Railway Bill passed into law in 1913 and tunneling work commenced the following year. Coinciding with the outbreak of the First World War, it would take much longer than expected. Over 1000 tons of cast iron track had to be laid.   When the postal railway line finally opened in 1927, it was evidently a triumph, carrying up to four million letters a day between eight London sorting offices. And for 75 years, it never really stopped    trains running for 22 hours followed by two hours of maintenance every day. But before that, the tunnels served another function    storing national art treasures from the British Museum, the Tate Gallery and other art institutions. In 1918, amid growing concern about German Zeppelin and   bombing raids, the British Museum moved the Parthenon Frieze and the Rosetta Stone into the postal tunnels and the National Portrait Gallery sent down over 600 paintings. A ride on the Mail Train, The Postal Museum is rebranding itself and opening the secret tunnels to the public for the first time. From next spring, you will be able to take ride on a brand new miniature train under London. I was recently able to preview part of the tourist experience.  The cameraman and I were given hard hats and builders’ boots and guided down concrete steps. We descended slowly. First impressions were of an engineering marvel, literally bearing the weight of its history    great   ribbed tunnels, stretching out into the pitch black.  The tunnels were dug by hand, using pickaxes and shovels. Construction work took over three and half years and a few    an unspecified number    of laborers died in the process. Clambering, crouched along the tracks (I banged my hard hat on the tunnel roof several times) there was an indefinable sense of abandonment and     it should be said    a certain monotony. Here were empty tunnels with a silent, eerie deadness    a catacomb without bodies.  Most of the tunnels were less than three meters high (under 10 feet) in some places barely two meters. Whichever way we looked, the tunnels rose and fell, bending and curving out of sight. Down a short descent, one particular siding was nicknamed the ”train graveyard”    it was filled with rusting rolling stock.  We had no way of telling whether it was day or night. There was just gloomy fluorescent lighting above a platform where mail was once quickly loaded and unloaded.  At its peak, driverless trains pulled in here every seven minutes, zipping in and out, igniting a dust trail of blue sparks in the dark. Now, there was no rattle or hum or screech of brakes: we had to imagine it for ourselves. The maintenance men, Ray Middlesworth, aged 59, has worked in the tunnels as a maintenance engineer for 30 years. He thinks of it as ”a miniature   Tube,” he says. ”Other people say it’s spooky, claustrophobic but to us, it’s like our front room. ” And, like coal miners, a close camaraderie existed among the men.  Since 2003, when the system was finally shut down, there’s been a crew of just three maintenance men ”walking the line” with torches and ensuring the tunnels aren’t flooded.  Ray’s fellow engineer, Graham Devitt, aged 55, has been ”down” on the railway for 25 years off and on and is still astonished by its anonymity.  ”We run right under Central London and it’s amazing that nobody knew we here. A couple of thousand people worked in the postal sorting office above us and most of them weren’t even aware we were here.”  Middlesworth played with trains as a child. ”I’ve got a big one now. I’ve upgraded,” he says with a laugh. Not for much longer    he’s retiring soon.  He is still clearly very much attached to his 1926   maintenance locomotive. Now a grimy yellow, he refers to it affectionately as ”the banana,” all six and a half tons of it. Ray squeezes nimbly into the driver’s cabin and will happily and proudly show anyone the controls, still a boy at heart with his train set.  The extraordinary fact is that for much of its working life (  that is) the Post Office Railway was almost certainly the quickest way to cross London    ten kilometers in just 14 minutes. Of course, no one ever used it like that. The line wasn’t designed to carry passengers, just mail. As an old General Post Office poster used to exclaim, it was all about the ’”Speed, Speed, Speed” of delivery.  The Postal Museum Deputy Director, Tim Ellison likes to tell  the Post Office story in contemporary terms    as ”the social network of its day    an incredible service on a scale that most people today wouldn’t possibly be able to imagine.”  A crucial part of it was having its own bespoke underground London railway. Its existence remains a revelation."
No Country for Old Christians? Phil Robertson Crushes It in ‘Torchbearer’ Film - Breitbart,"In a groundbreaking new documentary film coming to select theaters on October 7, Duck Dynasty’s Phil Robertson challenges a modern,   worldview by proposing a walk through history in the light of faith. [In this visually riveting documentary titled “Torchbearer” by veteran filmmaker Stephen K. Bannon, Robertson proposes that civilizations that abandon God as the bedrock of their rights and liberties wind up falling into nihilism and decay.  The Duck Dynasty patriarch is an unapologetic witness to the Christian faith as the cornerstone of Western Civilization, which has earned him the undying ire of the   Left. The film begins with a series of vignettes showing some of Robertson’s more controversial comments and the righteous rage they have provoked among the politically correct. Pilloried in the mainstream media for his traditional, biblically based views on topics such as human sexuality and religious liberty, Robertson has been labeled racist, homophobic, ignorant and bigoted —  all for espousing positions that up to a generation ago were considered normal and mainstream in U. S. society. Early in the film, one unidentified commentator says of Robertson that he “looks like a homeless lunatic who might shoot you. ” And yet, as this bearded modern Jeremiah expounds his case for Christianity and a return to God, he comes across as remarkably articulate and theologically nuanced, appealing variously to philosophy, history and common sense. Striking the pose of a biblical patriarch, Robertson cuts an impressive figure, and even his critics will be forced to reckon with a man whose simple,   appearance masks a subtle intellect and a keen grasp of perennial truths. The documentary was filmed on location in sites as varied as Athens, Rome, Paris, Auschwitz, Omaha Beach and Rev. Martin Luther King’s jail cell in Birmingham Alabama. In each site, Robertson offers a message, underscoring Christianity’s unique contribution to human history and civilization while also warning of the results when nations and societies detach themselves from belief in God. “In the absence of God,” Robertson repeatedly intones, “man becomes the determiner of all things. ” Speaking within the framework of a biblically informed worldview, Robertson catalogs the consequences of sin and the rejection of God, resulting in wars, disease, hatred, corruption and death. Attempts to replace God with Nietzschean nihilism or social Darwinism reduce man to just one animal among many, Robertson cautions, resulting in the brutal ethics of survival of the fittest and an ideology of eugenics that undergirds organizations like Planned Parenthood. Robertson moreover rejects a false antagonism between Biblical belief and modern science, while also showing that science alone is woefully insufficient to explain the meaning and purpose of human existence. Showcasing the early years of Christianity, Robertson compares ancient Athens to Harvard Yard, while casting the Roman Empire as an early version of New York City. To this city of Rome, the apostles Peter and Paul came to spread the good news of the risen Christ, Robertson notes, and this is where they met their end as martyrs for that same faith. By abandoning and rejecting God, Robertson suggests, all civilizations are bound to decay and fall. “A civilization’s best chance of survival is to anchor itself in the God of creation. ” Bringing this conviction to bear on American society, Robertson applauds the wisdom behind the U. S. Declaration of Independence, which understands rights and liberties to be grounded in God. “This link between human rights and belief in God is crucial,” he proposes. Yet “what happens when you strip away this belief in God as our Creator? What anchor do you have for human dignity and rights?” he asks. Chronicling some of the worst atrocities in human history such as Robespierre’s Reign of Terror and Hitler’s Germany, Robertson concludes that “tyranny is man’s answer to anarchy,” since “both come from godlessness. ” “In the absence of God, man becomes the sole determiner of human worth,” he notes. Nietzsche’s will to power means that “the man with the biggest stick determines who lives and who dies,” he observes, which ultimately led to Auschwitz, an “assembly line for mass murder. ” In this sweeping look at history, Robertson even takes a swipe at modern utilitarian ethics. “If you live by the utilitarian belief in the greatest good for the greatest number of people,” he asks, “what happens when the majority decides it’s the greatest good to kill all the Jews?” “From the guillotine to the gas chamber to the gulag, the story is the same,” Robertson says. “When you take out God as the anchor of your civilization you open the door to tyranny. Instead of human rights you have the will to power of the ruler who makes himself the sole determinant of what is true and just. ” “When God is eliminated, human beings are no longer   we are nothing more than ‘the masses,’” he warns. Robertson’s walk through history eventually leads to the present day, a crossroads that demands an honest look at where we are now, and hard decisions about where we are going. When society becomes   and   he cautions, it cannot forever endure. This is especially true when other violent forces hostile to Christianity and the West rise to destroy it, as can be seen in the escalation of Islamic extremism. As we reject the worldview that gave us Western civilization, “rooted in liberty and love,” Robertson proposes, another worldview is rising to take its place, “rooted in dominance and submission, a death cult. ” Appropriately, the film poignantly ends with scenes of baptism in a river, suggesting that true conversion and going back to God may be the only hope for America’s future. A return to God and to America’s Christian roots may allow it once again to become a City on a Hill, to once again take its place in a dark world as “Torchbearer. ” “Torchbearer” is coming to select theaters on October 7, to be followed by release on various digital and VOD platforms, including Comcast, Dish, iTunes, Vudu, Amazon, and more.

"Border Patrol Agents Bust Child Sexual Predator, Murderer","Border Patrol agents in the Tucson Sector arrested multiple illegal aliens who had entered the U. S. including a Mexican convicted of sex crimes against a child and a Salvadoran man who had been convicted of murder. [The arrests took place in the Tucson Sector in southern Arizona last week, according to information obtained from U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials. On November 21, agents assigned to the Brian Terry Border Patrol Station apprehended a Mexican national who had illegally reentered the U. S. A records check revealed the Mexican man had been previously convicted on a felony charge of lewd conduct with a child under the age of 16. He spent 365 days in an Idaho prison and was subsequently deported.  The Mexican national now faces felony charges of illegal reentry after being deported as a convicted sex offender. Two days earlier, Border Patrol agents detained a group of suspected drug smugglers. The group was carrying more than 350 pounds of marijuana, according to CBP officials. The Border Patrol agents took the suspected smugglers into custody. During processing, it was learned that one of the men, a Salvadoran national, had previously been arrested for homicide. He was convicted and spent nine years in prison. The location of his offense was not disclosed by CBP officials. The Salvadoran man was subsequently deported. He has now been arrested and charged with felony reentry after deportation. Breitbart Texas has reported extensively on these types of criminal aliens who repeatedly reenter the U. S. after being deported for their crimes. These individuals frequently include previously deported sex offenders. These criminals feel free to come and go across the Mexican border at will because of the federal government’s failure to properly secure the nation’s border.   Donald Trump repeatedly promised during his presidential campaign to build a wall and finally secure the border. The Brian A. Terry Border Patrol Station is named in honor of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry who was shot and killed during a night operation near the Arizona Border with Mexico in December 2010. Two guns from teh Obama Administration’s Operation Fast and Furious were found at the scene of his murder.

Soros-Financed Groups Provided Script for Anti-Trump Town Halls,"An organization partnered with   groups that calls itself the Revolutionary Love Project distributed an actual script with   talking points for citizens to use when meeting with constituents in town halls, including during last week’s Congressional recess. [The script provides    language suggestions that accuse the Trump administration of “xenophobia, racism, and Islamophobia. ”  It asks activists to use the descriptors to petition their representatives to “forcefully condemn” and support legislation opposing President Trump’s immigration and border security agendas.  The script is entitled, “#NoBanNoWallNoRaids Talking Points for Congressional Townhalls. ” It ends with contact information for activists from two groups heavily financed by billionaire George Soros  —   Avideh Moussavian at the National Immigration Law Center and Deepa Iyer at the Center for Social Inclusion. Contacted by Breitbart News, Moussavian confirmed his group “contributed” to the script “in response to overwhelming concern and fear stemming from the January 27th executive order that sought to ban the entry of refugees and Muslims and in response to mounting questions from community members about how to express these concerns to policy makers. ” Despite Moussavian’s claims, Trump’s executive order did not seek to ban Muslims from entering the U. S. It temporarily halted the refugee program while the flawed security screening process could be reworked. The   script for activists is meant to aid a project driven by the George   MoveOn. org group declaring the week of February     —   the first congressional recess of the 115th Congress  —   to be “Resistance Recess. ” The project called on activists to show up at “elected officials’ events, town halls, and other public appearances to make it clear to those who represent us in Congress, as well as to the media, that tolerance of the Trump Administration’s hurtful policies is intolerable, that indifference or idleness is not acceptable, that complacency is politically toxic. ” A blast email from the Revolutionary Love Project urged supporters to use the talking points “script” to “voice your concern” when meeting last week with constituents during the Congressional recess. The actual script recommends that activists say the following in stages: Stage 1: Who You Are. My name is ______ and I’m a resident of _______. Add a description of your connection to the community. Stage 2: Your Concerns. I am particularly concerned about the Administration’s efforts to  target and criminalize immigrants, refugees and people entering our country from   countries. I want you as a representative of our district to understand the impact of Trump’s executive orders and to take action. The script provides talking points and urges activists to use the language to “buttress your concerns. ” The talking points deploy key words like “xenophobia, racism, and Islamophobia” as suggested descriptions of Trump’s temporary refugee halt as well as the administration’s immigration enforcement policies. Here are some talking points provided: *Trump’s executive orders to deport undocumented immigrants, to punish   sanctuary cities for defending the Constitution, to ban people from seven   countries, and to shut the door on refugees all have one thing in common: they are rooted in hate, bigotry and a desire to instill fear rather than promote unity. We call this xenophobia, racism, and Islamophobia. *Each of these executive orders is based on the false premise that immigrants pose a threat to us. They are hateful attacks not only on those newly arriving or seeking entry into the U. S. but to those of us, including U. S. citizens, who have raised families here, paid taxes for years and who have made enormous sacrifices and contributions. *The policy changes called for in the executive orders are extremist, costly and ineffective, and they will not make us safer. They have wreaked havoc and confusion in airports across the globe and at home, in our schools, workplaces, and backyards. *We are witnessing a massive militarization of our deportation force, and a supersizing of interior and border patrol agents. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids are occurring in homes and workplaces, and the climate of fear as a result of rumored and reported raids are paralyzing our communities. Parents are afraid to send their children to school. Pregnant mothers are afraid to get basic nutrition assistance and prenatal care. We are separating families, hurting our economy and targeting the most vulnerable, without accountability from our federal government that is causing this devastation. The script asks representatives to “forcefully condemn” Trump’s immigration and border security agendas and to “support legislation in Congress that would block implementation and nullify the effects of these orders and prevent any funding for them. ” The National Immigration Law Center, which is listed on the talking points memo, was party to a lawsuit last month that temporarily blocked Trump’s original executive order. The National Immigration Law Center has received numerous grants from Soros’s Open Society earmarked for general support. The second group listed on the talking points memo, the Center for Social Inclusion, is also the recipient of numerous Open Society grants. The Revolutionary Love Project, which distributed the script, is partnered with numerous   groups, including T’ruah and Trinity United Church of Christ, which was formerly led by Jeremiah Wright Jr. Barack Obama’s infamous radical pastor for nearly twenty years. The Project is partnered with the organizers of last month’s Women’s March. Soros reportedly has ties to more than 50 “partners” of that march. Also, this journalist first reported on the march leaders’ close associations with Soros. Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

"Quebec Mosque Shooting Kills at Least 6, and 2 Suspects Are Arrested - The New York Times","OTTAWA  —   Gunmen opened fire in a mosque in the city of Quebec on Sunday night, killing six people and wounding eight others in what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called a “terrorist attack on Muslims. ” Étienne Doyon, a spokesman for the Quebec police, told reporters at the scene that the attack on the mosque, the Islamic Cultural Center of Quebec, had occurred around 8 p. m. At a news conference early Monday the police confirmed the six fatalities and said that two suspects had been arrested. The attack shook Canada, a country where mass shootings are uncommon, and came as the country has become known as a beacon for refugees fleeing warfare and terrorism in   nations. Mr. Trudeau assailed what he called “this terrorist attack on Muslims in a center of worship and refuge. ” “It is   to see such senseless violence,” he said in a statement early Monday. “Diversity is our strength, and religious tolerance is a value that we, as Canadians, hold dear. ” Christine Colombe, a spokeswoman for the Quebec Provincial Police, said the victims ranged in age from 35 to 70 and said that 39 people who were in the mosque were not hurt. The police had not yet identified a motive in the shootings, saying the investigation was just beginning. Ms. Colombe said that one of the two suspects was arrested at the scene of the shooting, while another was apprehended nearby on Île d’Orleans. The police said that some of those wounded in the shooting were seriously hurt. On Twitter, Martin Coiteux, the provincial minister of public safety, said that “the police systems for dealing with terrorist acts have been activated” in the wake of the shooting. “Ensuring the safety of the population is our priority,” he wrote.   the   service of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, said the area surrounding the mosque had been sealed off by the police after the attack. Last June, a pig’s head was left at the door of the mosque in the middle of Ramadan. Practicing Muslims regard pork as unclean and do not eat it. The president of the mosque, Mohamed Yangui, was interviewed on Ici RDI, a French Canadian broadcaster. He was not at the mosque during the shooting but said that people who were present had told him that one gunman was able to reload his weapon several times. He said he had been told by witnesses that the gunmen had entered on the ground floor and had gone to the second floor where women pray, but he did not know whether any women were in the mosque at the time. The attack came after Mr. Trudeau said that Canada stood ready to continue welcoming refugees from terrorism and war and as President Trump’s executive order on immigration stranded people around the world and provoked condemnation that it was directed at Muslims. In the wake of the Quebec shooting, the New York City police stepped up protection of mosques, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter. About 765, 000 people live in the city of Quebec, and 6, 760 of them identified themselves as Muslims during the last national census. Mr. Trudeau posted a message on Twitter on Saturday welcoming refugees to Canada and included a photograph of himself with a child under the hashtag #WelcomeToCanada. Since Mr. Trudeau took office in late 2015 the country has admitted nearly 40, 000 refugees, many of them fleeing the war in Syria. Canada’s warm embrace of Syrian refugees has won the country accolades at home and abroad, but is not without its domestic opponents. A survey in Ontario last summer found that while there was widespread support for accepting the refugees, only a third of respondents had a positive impression of Islam, and more than half felt its mainstream doctrines promoted violence.   incidents have been on the rise in Canada, with several minor incidents reported in Quebec during the past year. A Montreal mosque and a   Muslim community center were slightly damaged in separate arson attempts in December, and the head of the Association of Muslims and Arabs for a Secular Quebec received online death threats the month before. The increasing tension led a member of Parliament, Iqra Khalid, to put forward a motion in the national House of Commons in December calling on the government to condemn Islamophobia and request a study on how the government could combat the trend. The motion will probably be voted on when the House returns to session this week. In the wake of Sunday night’s attack, the premier of the province of Quebec, Philippe Couillard, said that solidarity rallies were planned on Monday for people to express their concern about the shootings. “We are with you. You are at home,” he said, in words directed at the province’s Muslim residents."
"Exclusive — Duck Dynasty’s Phil Robertson: Chuck Schumer, Dems Who Opposed Judge Gorsuch ‘Godless, Lawless’","Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that Democrats who opposed the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court as America’s next Justice are “Godless” and “lawless. ”[“What I think about it is: Psalms 14:1 makes a clear, concise statement, and the statement is a fool says in his heart there is no God,” Robertson said in the exclusive interview when asked about Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and the Democrats planning to try to block confirmation of Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. “These people are Godless. And if you’re Godless, then you’re lawless —  you practice lawlessness. Everyone who sins breaks the law. In fact, sin is lawlessness —  that’s the Biblical definition of lawlessness. ”  The interview, which took place before Senate Republicans blasted through the Democrats’ filibuster with the nuclear option ahead of a final confirmation vote on Friday —  which is expected to succeed —  was part of a   conversation with Robertson on the Trump presidency, the institutional left, and the Gorsuch confirmation. Robertson said: So what you have on the one side is lawless people such as Chuck Schumer and these radical activists on the Supreme Court —  judicial activists —  and it scares the daylights out of them to have a man who still thinks it’s worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God. Romans 1, Verse 28 says because they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, God gave them over to a depraved mind to do what ought not to be done. And there’s a list of attitudes and deeds and it reads something like this —  this is off the top of my head, but it’s pretty close —  it says ‘you give them over to do what shouldn’t be done, to a depraved mind, he said, they become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They become full of murder, envy, strife, malice, and  deceit. They are insolent, arrogant, and boastful. They are gossips, slanderers,    …    ’ It goes through the list and it ends by saying they’re ‘senseless, faithless, heartless and ruthless —  they invent ways of doing evil.’ Therefore, that’s the one side of individuals —  if you can imagine that —  that’s what they’re like, the group that have formed this block against Judge Gorsuch, a guy who thinks it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God. If you think about it, the Ten Commandments are hanging just above the Chief Justice’s head and the reason the Founders said ‘I’ll tell you what boys, when you get to the Supreme Court hang the Ten Commandments over their head’ —  what the Founders were trying to get people to see then and we’ve lost sight of now, is there is a gigantic difference between the Supreme Court, men being in positions of judging, there is a gigantic difference between the Supreme Court by man and the supreme being, who loves us all. You understand what I’m saying? They hung the Ten Commandments over their head to say ‘don’t forget God in your judging, don’t forget God in your decisions’ because all the Founding Fathers —  literally all of them, they went right on down the line. You lose your virtue, that’s Chuck Schumer. When you lose your virtue, your religion leaves, your morality leaves, and the last thing to go is your freedom. Well, we’re on a path here and that’s why it is critically important to get a   man —  a man who is at least conscious of God —  on the Supreme Court. Got to have it, or this thing is fixing to implode. Robertson also said that Gorsuch did “remarkably well” in his confirmation hearing, despite the fact that the Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee were aggressively trying to undermine his chances at confirmation. He went on: My view, and I’m just viewing the proceedings —  the hearing —  and it had the feel about it, you had a sheep or a little goat and you are surrounded by wolves. And I mean it was like, or another way I could put it is, you had one man of virtue —  which is the pool of men fitted to the virtuous category is becoming smaller in each coming decade in my opinion. General moral excellence, right thinking, goodness, meritorious, excellence in general, effective power in force, moral strength, courage —  that’s the Gorsuches of the world. And the last thing we need —  it’s far better to have a good devout Catholic like Justice Scalia or a devout Episcopalian like Gorsuch than a lawless   on the Supreme Court of all places. So if we’re not careful here, if we don’t get Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, judicial tyranny will reign without mitigation to no end. So we are really hanging on the edge of a precipice. We came within a hare’s breath of this leftwing bunch, these lawless fools, we came within a hare’s breath of them taking over the entire country with this last election. But I personally think, they asked me ‘Phil, what do you think? Who do you think’s going to win?’ I said, ‘We have one shot. The shot is, if the Almighty —  he’s worked through all kinds of people with character flaws before —  I said if the Almighty wants Donald Trump in there, oh he’s going in. That’s all I have to say.’ Well, all the pundits and all the political operatives and all this bunch and the polls —  they factored in everything and everybody but God Almighty. And Lord behold, good ole Trump did get in there and I have no problem with his policies from a Biblical standpoint at all. Robertson praised the Senate Republicans for going nuclear and beating the Democratic filibuster. “Without hesitation, whatever it takes,” Robertson said when asked if he would go nuclear to get Gorsuch confirmed. “You know, Harry Reid is the one who dreamed it up to fulfill his little agenda at the time. Well, we ought to just go ahead and take him up on his deal that he made. Yeah, I’d do it. I’d do the nuclear option in a second. ” Robertson also said that there’s “no doubt about it” that President Donald Trump’s nomination of Gorsuch to the Supreme Court was the most important thing he could do as president of the United States. He added: No doubt about it, but you’re looking at —  and there might be some more that come up —  but you’re looking at the next 30 years barring some kind of unfortunate early death or something but you’re looking at 30 years of the country and if you could stay that long, maybe the Almighty will have given us time to repent. America needs to repent back to God and bow down at his feet. I’m more into eternal healthcare than the stuff they’re arguing about now with Obamacare and all this stuff. I want America to invest in eternal healthcare by doing two things: love God and love their neighbor, and just do what is right. So my thinking is vet everything through the Bible and there will be no problems at all, so with Judge Gorsuch he’s a devout Episcopalian. I’ll take a devout Episcopalian over a lawless   any way you want to slice it. More from the Robertson interview is forthcoming."
A substance used in non-stick cookware since the 1940s is causing a ’national public health crisis ... with no apparent end in sight’,"’’ ’Concern over the toxic  has spread to communities across the country where locals worry that water polluted with the chemical may be harming their health.’ ’“Known scope of contamination has gone from a regional problem to a national public health crisis that continues to widen, with no apparent end in sight,” leaders of the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit environmental research organization, wrote in a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) earlier this week.’ ’  and  are among the states where the issue has received attention in recent weeks.’ ’PFOA, short for perfluorooctanoate, has been used in consumer products since the 1940s often in   cookware.

NBC Moving Ahead with Megyn Kelly-Alex Jones Interview Despite Backlash,"NEW YORK (AP)  —   NBC News is moving ahead with plans to air Megyn Kelly’s interview with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones this weekend despite a backlash that has cost the show advertisers and led to Kelly being dropped as host for an event by an organization founded by parents of children killed at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. [The network has been taken aback by the response to booking Jones, the “Infowars” host who has questioned whether the killing of 26 people in 2012 at the school in Newton, Connecticut, was a hoax. NBC News Chairman Andy Lack said the story will be edited with the sensitivity of its critics in mind.  “It’s important to get it right,” Lack said. Reporters have interviewed controversial characters like Syrian President Bashar Assad and child molesters in the past without getting this kind of a reaction, Kelly said in an interview Tuesday. “What I think we’re doing is journalism,” she said. “The bottom line is that while it’s not always popular, it’s important. I would submit to you that neither I nor NBC News has elevated Alex Jones in any way. He’s been elevated by 5 or 6 million viewers or listeners, and by the president of the United States. As you know, journalists don’t get the choice over who has power or influence in our country. ” Sandy Hook Promise, an   violence group, said it had asked Kelly to step down as host of its   gala in Washington. The group cannot support Kelly or NBC’s decision to give a platform to Jones and hopes NBC reconsiders its plan to broadcast the interview, said Nicole Hockley,   and managing director. Hockley, whose    son Dylan was killed at Sandy Hook, founded the organization with Mark Barden, who lost his    son Daniel. Kelly said she understood and respected the decision, but was disappointed. NBC’s plans have cost it some advertisers for this week’s edition of “Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly. ” It was not immediately clear how many only the financial firm JPMorgan Chase has been publicly identified. “That comes with the territory,” Lack said. “It’s not unusual. We kind of know when we’re doing controversial stories, that’s going to happen. It doesn’t stop us from doing controversial stories. ” To some critics, NBC’s timing makes the decision worse  —   airing on Father’s Day an interview that has been publicly denounced by parents who lost young children at Sandy Hook. NBC said it was scheduled for competitive reasons, because Jones had been booked to appear on ABC’s daytime show “The View” next week. A representative of “The View” said Jones had canceled his appearance there and he will not be rescheduled. Lack noted that he had suggested approaching Jones for an interview to David Corvo, the NBC News executive who supervises the network’s newsmagazines. He said there’s nothing new about putting people on the air even if they’re unpopular or have views that are deplorable to many. “I’ve got tremendous understanding of why they’re so upset, as they have every right to be,” he said. “Of course we’re looking at it. We’re looking at the editorial process. ” The interview has put Kelly, who jumped to NBC from Fox News Channel earlier this year, squarely back in the headlines the New York Daily News called it “Nutwork News” on its front page Tuesday. She was one of Trump’s favorite targets during the presidential campaign because he was annoyed at tough questions she asked him at a   debate. Jones, for his part, has already denounced the interview as “fake news” and said it was purposeful hit job on him. “I knew in my gut this was going to blow up in their face,” he said on his show."
Muslim Lawmakers Propose Banning Alcohol in Indonesia,"Lawmakers are proposing a ban on alcohol sales and consumption throughout Indonesia, which may negatively affect the island of Bali’s booming tourist economy. [The ban would include production, sale, and consumption of alcohol across the entire country, but would have profound effects on the island of Bali. For anyone found violating this law, a prison sentence of as many as ten years is in place.  Indonesia is the most populous Muslim nation in the world. Two hundred and sixty million people live in Indonesia, with a majority of those people being Muslim. While much of Indonesia adheres to strict Islamic moral codes, Bali is home to a high Hindu population, attracts tourists from all over the world, and is seen as more liberal in its views. Nearly four million tourists visit the island of Bali every year. The majority of those tourists come from the United Kingdom and Australia. Nearly 100, 000 UK residents visit each year, while the largest tourist group to the island is made up of Australians. Just the rumor of the proposed ban has convinced many Australians to change their holiday plans if the ban goes into full effect. The head of Indonesia’s Hotel and Restaurant Association, Hariyadi Sukamdani, is particularly concerned with the adverse effects that the ban on alcohol would have on Bali. “No matter how beautiful the country is, if they can’t find alcohol, they [tourists] won’t want to come here,” Sukamdani said. Rudolf Dethu, a Balinese musician, is one of the major figures who is heading the efforts to stop this ban from taking effect. Dethu believes that this ban would havea tremendous effect on the country of Indonesia, but especially Bali. According to The Telegraph, Dethu fears that the ban is just another way for fundamentalist Islam to work its way into the Indonesian government —   “fearing like many others that the curb is a sign of creeping Islamisation in the sprawling island nation, where there has been a recent push to impose more extreme forms of Sharia. ” Dethu went on to say, “For me this is not as simple as banning alcohol. There is a hidden agenda behind it. It’s a radicalisation,” he said. Indonesia is going through rapid social change and growing increasingly Islamist, particularly regarding local attitudes towards unorthodox lifestyles. Early last week, Breitbart News reported, “The head of Indonesia’s   agency says he is hoping to boost police capabilities and wage a war on drug traffickers similar to the controversial work President Rodrigo Duterte has begun in the Philippines, adding that the life of a drug dealer was ‘meaningless. ’” In August, Indonesia rebuffed criticisms from Human Rights Watch that the country does not protect the rights of LGBT Indonesians, with officials claiming to support human rights while insisting there is “no room” for LGBT people in Indonesia."
Viacom Board Said to End Salary for Sumner Redstone - The New York Times,"The ailing media mogul Sumner M. Redstone will no longer draw a salary from Viacom, one of the big media companies he controls, two people briefed on the development said Wednesday. The move follows a   legal battle in California that highlighted Mr. Redstone’s failing health while challenging his mental capacity. The case was dismissed last week, but the details that emerged prompted Viacom’s board to evaluate his compensation and status. Eliminating his pay is a gesture toward acknowledging that he is no longer involved in operations and deserving pay as a company executive. Mr. Redstone, 92, remains chairman emeritus and controlling shareholder of Viacom and CBS, a $40 billion media empire. He controls about 80 percent of the voting shares in the companies through National Amusements, the private theater chain company started by his father. Control of the two companies will be passed to a trust only after he dies or is declared not competent. Filed in November by a former companion and romantic partner, the lawsuit included embarrassing and salacious claims about Mr. Redstone, who has had minor strokes and has a speech impediment. Those included details about his sexual appetite, incontinence and demands to eat steak while on a feeding tube. Those details prompted investors to raise questions about Mr. Redstone’s pay, his role at his companies and other corporate governance issues. In February, he stepped down as chairman at both companies. In dismissing the case after only one day, the judge relied heavily on videotaped testimony from Mr. Redstone, saying the media mogul had convincingly asserted that he did not want the former companion, Manuela Herzer, to supervise his health care, as she was seeking. “I think he said what he wanted to say,” the judge said. But the same testimony, a transcript of which was released to news organizations, also included halting answers, profanity, forgetfulness and nonresponsiveness  —   putting renewed focus on the media mogul’s mental capacity. There was also an evaluation by a geriatric psychiatrist. The judge, in his evaluation of the testimony, said, “It is also not in dispute that Redstone suffers from either mild or moderate dementia. ” Mr. Redstone’s total compensation was $2 million in the 2015 fiscal year, down from $13 million in 2014. Viacom’s board met on Wednesday. It is not clear whether the board of CBS was making the same considerations. CBS declined to comment. The Viacom development was first reported by The Wall Street Journal."
Northwestern to Quadruple Safe Spaces for Black Students After Complaints - Breitbart,"According to a task force report out of Northwestern University, administrators are planning to quadruple the number of safe spaces for black students. [The proposal for additional environments for black students came after a    on the “Black Student Experience” at Northwestern. The report concluded that black students feel “dissatisfied, exhausted and alienated on campus. ” As a result, the report provided 14 recommendations on how the experience for black students could be approved at Northwestern.  Members of task force behind Black Student Experience committee hope to see changes soon. https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Daily Northwestern (@thedailynu) September 22, 2016,  The recommendations include increasing the black population amongst both the students and faculty, creating an “academic support hub” for black students, increasing the inclusivity of fraternities and sororities, and quadrupling the spaces where exclusively black students can socialize. One finding in the data is the sense of diverse Black identities and experiences that cannot all be encompassed in the Black House alone. So it seems like a good moment to call for the creation of new spaces for Black connection and community building, but ones which are open to student definition and creation. Therefore, in addition to the Black House, the task force recommends three space options for making Northwestern accessible to Black students for social purposes. The guidelines for reserving the spaces should be broadly understood and have clearly articulated policies. The report also suggests that admissions officers at the university should aggressively recruit black students and faculty. To achieve this end, the report suggests that prospective black students should be offered attractive   packages and black faculty candidates should be offered exciting research opportunities. Some students interviewed for the report argued that the predominantly white greek life system dictates the campus culture trends that have they now want reversed. “In fact, some African   students go so far as to blame the predominantly White fraternity and sorority community for campus climate issues. ” Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.

Rouhani takes strong lead in Iran’s presidential election,"Tehran, Iran (CNN) Incumbent Hassan Rouhani leads in early vote counting in Iran’s presidential race, with a big lead over his conservative rival, Ebrahim Raisi. Preliminary results put Rouhani ahead with 14 million votes. Raisi is second with 10 million votes.  More than 40 million Iranian voters flocked to polling stations Friday, and by Saturday morning more than 25 million votes had been counted, according to the head of Iran’s Interior Ministry State Elections Committee. Rouhani, considered a moderate, was a key architect of the 2015 nuclear deal with the US, the EU and other partners. The election is seen, at least in part, as a referendum on that agreement, which has so far yielded mixed economic results for Iranians. His closest opponent is conservative cleric Raisi, who has cast doubt on the benefits of the nuclear deal.  Some polling stations remained open as late as midnight local time (3:30 p. m. ET) because of high voter turnout, Iran’s Ministry of Interior said. CNN journalists in Tehran reported seeing long lines as voters apparently heeded calls for a big turnout. Iran’s Supreme Leader Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was among the first to cast his ballot and urged others to do the same. ”I believe that the presidential election is very important. The fate of the country is in the hands of people,” he said. Raisi is widely seen as Khamenei’s preferred candidate    indeed, he is often mentioned as his possible successor. Rouhani, meanwhile, is essentially running for   as an outsider, and is backed by Iran’s reformist camp.  For many in Iran, especially in affluent areas of the capital, Tehran, Rouhani has provided a glimpse of what many have long desired    engagement with the outside world, without the types of banking and visa restrictions, as well as economic sanctions    that left them feeling so isolated.   supporters recognize that Rouhani isn’t perfect    he too, after all, is also a cleric. But he’s widely seen by reformers as their best hope for change. A CNN crew in north Tehran, where there are a lot of moderate Rouhani supporters, saw long lines all day at one polling station, with some people waiting up to three hours to vote despite the scorching heat.  Voter Mahya Kamalvan, 26, told CNN: ”We cannot complain if someone else is chosen. We have to prove that we are here, we support what we want. And then if anything happens the other way, maybe we can say something.” Another voter,    medical student Yasaman Allahgholy, said it was her duty to vote to ”make my country more free, and be more popular in the world,” and that it was important to protect the real improvements she has seen recently in Iran’s medical system. ”I am young, and I want to live in a more free country. To show what I think without fearing from being in jail or something like that,” she said. ”When we fight with other countries, when we show an angry face to other countries, our economy will decrease little by little. So it’s really important for me to participate in this election, for my future.” ”It’s the reason why I have [waited] about one hour in this line, in this hot weather.” Conservative frontrunner, Should Raisi win, Iran is expected to retreat from the kind of nascent international engagement seen during Rouhani’s first term, with a focus on growing its economy internally rather than looking for direct foreign investment. Raisi’s history may deter some voters    the    cleric was a member of the   ”Death Commission,” which presided over the summary executions of thousands of political prisoners in the summer of 1988.  But Rouhani won’t necessarily benefit.  Ahmad Majidyar, who leads the IranObserved Project at the Middle East Institute, believes that ”many reformists are dismayed by the President’s unwillingness to stand up to the country’s judiciary and security establishment,” meaning many may simply not bother to vote at all.  In a tight contest, a traditionally high turnout among conservatives could be enough to give Raisi victory. However, Rouhani has history on his side: no sitting president has failed to win a second term since 1981. Official results, which will be announced by Iran’s Ministry of Interior, are not expected until later this weekend. If no one candidate achieves an absolute majority    over 50% of the vote    a runoff will take place on May 26.  Read: Rouhani promises change in Iran, The key issues   The President has had a tough time defending the 2015 nuclear deal and his opponents have accused him of not making good on his promises. Debates have largely centered on this issue.  Rouhani billed the deal as one that would thrust open the gates of economic opportunity, bring the country out of its isolation and create millions of jobs for Iranians. The agreement has brought a string of billion dollar deals with Western firms for airplanes and oil exploration in Iran.  But the benefits have been largely limited by a fall in global oil prices and US President Donald Trump’s election, which introduced uncertainty for investors    Trump has repeatedly threatened to rip up the deal. For the average Iranian, the results have been lackluster, and Raisi has jumped upon this accusing Rouhani of sacrificing Iran’s sovereignty for a fool’s bargain.  Unemployment remains high    although it fell during Rouhani’s first term    and growth is middling. The official unemployment rate is 12. 5% and much higher for the  . But since the Iranian government counts anyone who works just one hour a week as employed, according to Hamed Mousavi of Tehran University, the true overall number is likely well over 20%. Rouhani stated the choice facing Iranians simply: ”Our nation will announce if it continues on the path of peacefulness, or if it wants to choose tension.” For voter Hassan Rahmani, 34, in northern Tehran, maintaining good relations is key to Iran’s future. ”All the growth in this country is dependent on relations with the other countries    European countries, United States, all the countries,” he told CNN. Ershan Nasroudi, 35, voiced a similar view. ”We see that if you want to have a safe economy, if you want to have a better life for the people, you have to have relations with other countries,” he said. Vibrant scenes, In Iran, where political speech is severely curtailed, newspapers and even social media channels are government regulated and protest comes with great personal risk, the quadrennial presidential election is an opportunity to blow off emotional steam, to act politically in the most public, and loud, of ways. At a campaign rally last week at the Azadi stadium in Tehran, Rouhani took to the stage and delivered a speech more worthy of an outsider than the incumbent. Standing behind a lectern and surveying the sea of purple    his campaign color    before him, Rouhani promised much. ”We want freedom of the press,” he declared. ”Freedom of association, and freedom of thought!” However, his supporters will be aware that even if   what Rouhani can achieve may be limited by the authority wielded by Iran’s Supreme Leader Khamenei, and by institutions such as the Revolutionary Guards."

UKIP ’Furious’ After Details Of ’Assassination Attempt’ Against Farage Leaked,"UKIP leader Nigel Farage was involved in a crash on a French motorway in October after a wheel on his Volvo estate fell off, the nuts holding it in place having been deliberately loosened. [Details of a potentially fatal car crash involving Mr. Farage became public this weekend after they were leaked to the press. A UKIP insider told Breitbart London Mr. Farage is “furious” at the news of his ordeal entering the public domain, while party officials are angry at Kent police for having failed to offer him protection in line with his high profile status and the number of death threats he receives.  Mr. Farage was driving along a French motorway near Dunkirk while he was returning home from Brussels in October when a wheel came off his car, causing the vehicle to crash. Mr Farage was forced to leap over a safety barrier to avoid oncoming traffic, reports the Daily Mail. He said: “‘It was the middle of bloody nowhere, and I was caught in a very bad position. “There was a huge section of roadworks with cars going back and forth on the same side of the carriageway. I suddenly realised I was losing steering but there was no hard shoulder to pull on to. I slowed down, put the hazards on and then one of the wheels came off. I jumped over the wall as quickly as I bloody well could to get away from lorries and everything”. When emergency services arrived to assist Mr. Farage, he was told by a police officer his wheel nuts had been deliberately unscrewed, suggesting the intention was to kill the UKIP leader by causing him to lose control while at high speed. Mr. Farage remarked that while police officers were used to single wheel nuts working themselves free without being noticed, for all four to do so at the same time was unheard of. Mr. Farage would not be drawn on a likely culprit: “I haven’t got a clue. Quite frankly, the way my life’s been over the past     years, nothing surprises me”. The UKIP leader had declined to speak about the incident until he was contacted by the Daily Mail newspaper after they received news of the crash from an unnamed source. A UKIP source told Breitbart London the core UKIP leadership team who knew about the crash had “kept quiet” and the fact the incident had been leaked did nothing more but “rub salt in the wounds”.  "

Trump’s $1.6 Billion Budget for Border Walls -- Mostly for South Texas,"President Donald Trump’s 2018 budget asks Congress to construct 60 miles of new border walls along the U. S.  border  —   all of which would be located in Texas. [The plan is for the Rio Grande Valley Sector to receive 32 miles of a new border wall, and 28 miles of a new levee wall. The levee in Hidalgo County is designed to address flooding. The budget refers to the new border wall as “a physical wall. ”  Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said, “We are absolutely dead serious about the wall. ” He called it one of President Trump’s “top three” budget priorities, reported Breitbart News on Tuesday. Mulvaney denied that the administration was scaling back funding for border walls by saying the Trump administration’s budget was a striking hike from the 2017 budget. The 2018 budget increases allocations for border security by $1. 1 billion, and $1. 5 billion for the U. S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The director of the Office of Management and Budget also urged Trump voters to be patient and said this proposed action was a beginning for a project that will be protracted. “Keep in mind you can’t just   …     you don’t automatically magically build a wall in the middle of nowhere,” the director stated. The budget for the U. S. Department of Justice also asks for $1. 8 million to “meet litigation, acquisition, and appraisal demands during the construction along the border between Mexico and the United States. ” Breitbart News reported that the funds would be used to hire 12 attorneys and eight staff members for the section of the DOJ that defends litigation arising from eminent domain proceedings (the Environmental and Natural Resources Division’s Land Acquisition Section, “LAS”). Those who are fighting the construction of border walls are mostly on partisan lines. Democratic U. S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett ( ) said “Putting taxpayers on the hook to pay for it is just the latest brick in a wall of broken campaign promises. If we are going to pour billions into concrete, it ought to be an investment in ourselves, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure,” reported Dallas’ WBAP 820 AM on Thursday. However, landowners in Texas say they will fight mightily to keep their property, and they hope the litigation will be protracted beyond any Trump administration tenure. The New York Times report also said there are more than 90 eminent domain lawsuits from landowners in South Texas and they have been pending since 2008. The Dallas radio station reported that Senator John Cornyn ( ) who serves as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration said, “If we really want to secure our borders, and I think the voters in this last presidential election indicated they did, we must be willing to devote the necessary level of funding to achieve it. ” Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Texas Schools Rebuff ’A-F’ Ratings,"An increasing number of Texas school boards are pushing back against the State’s revamped public school accountability system by passing resolutions that call for lawmakers to repeal a new   ratings scale. [Monday evening, the Austin Independent School District school board approved such a resolution. Last week, boards in DeSoto, Mesquite, and Forney school districts passed similar resolutions. Previously, so did Dripping Springs ISD and Waskom ISD school boards.  In 2015, the Texas Legislature passed HB 2804, which will change how the state measures public school accountability, awarding grades from A to F in the   academic year. This system intends to reduce the influence standardized testing plays, although it bases about 55 percent of a school’s accountability on the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) and 45 percent across five domains including factors like graduation and dropout rates, enrollment in   courses, college or career prep courses and testing, plus “chosen locally determined” community and student engagement, Breitbart Texas reported. The current system rates campuses as “met standard” or “needs improvement. ” Those tagged “Improvement Required” in two out of a three year period land on the unenviable Public Education Grant (PEG) list of failing campuses. Parents, education professionals, and lawmakers will get a glimpse of how schools stack up when the Texas Education Agency (TEA) previews the new accountability system in January. The sneak peek will only grade student achievement, student progress, closing performance gaps, and college or career readiness. Supporters of grading schools say HB 2804 will provide parents more insight and information into how well campuses actually perform. This wave of school board resolutions came in response to a    letter sent to school districts from the Texas Association of School Administrators (TASA) a group BallotPedia has described as “a government sector lobbying association” funded by taxpayer dollars. TASA opposes   ratings. KXAN reported a TASA representative said the last time they called for resolutions against   accountability tests, more than 900 school districts came on board. They hope for a similar   this time. TASA crafted a resolution template for school board members to use. It calls for replacing HB 2804 with “tenets set out in Creating a New Vision for Public Education in Texas,” their 2008 blueprint for 21st Century learning in Texas. They want to rate schools on “ ” accountability, which they say would reflect a four part evaluation with performance reviews by visiting teams, reports to parents and communities,   evidence of progress, and some standardized testing. Also, they argue too much of HB 2804 metrics still come from the STAAR test and say the new rating system provides no direction as to how or what schools must do to improve. TASA asserts   grading “creates a false impression about an entire neighborhood of children and shames students,” adding the “reduction of a school to a single grade whitewashes the variance in a school, unfairly reducing every student to the school’s assigned grade. ” Online, TASA houses an arsenal of materials including   talking points, a list of school districts around the state that support the resolution, and a press release for school boards to send “to local media to alert them of the board’s action, explain the concerns with Texas’   system, and let the public know there is a better alternative,” which TASA believes is their “vision. ” While most parents and teachers agree that standardized testing overshadows public education, the question is which version of accountability best serves students. School board members are publicly elected officials who join the Texas Association of School Boards (TASB) a lobbyist organization harshly criticized by state Senator Lois Kolkhorst ( ) for their “    mindset,” indoctrination, and groupthink culture in a Dallas Morning News report. A retired FBI agent turned Texas public school forensic accounting investigator shared similar sentiments about TASB with the Dallas newspaper. TASB represents the largest group of   officials in the state and includes all 1, 030 Texas school districts, 20 regional education service centers, 50 community colleges, 16 tax appraisal districts, and 137 shared service arrangements. They note one of their primary purposes is to represent school boards when lawmakers make decisions affecting Texas school districts. Breitbart Texas reported state legislators proposed a bill to boot a slew of education lobbyists out of classrooms in 2015.

Rio Olympics: Here’s What Happened Saturday - The New York Times,"The only gap in Katinka Hosszu’s swimming résumé was an Olympic medal, but she rectified that in resplendent fashion on Saturday night, winning the   individual medley in 4 minutes 26. 36 seconds at the Olympic Aquatics Stadium. The time broke the world record of 4:28. 43 set at the London Games by China’s Ye Shiwen. Here’s what to look forward to on Sunday. Hosszu’s best finish in six individual events contested over three previous Olympics was a fourth in the 400 I. M. in 2012. Ye finished 27th in the heats in defense of her title in 4:45. 86. Hosszu of Hungary is known for having a contentious and intense relationship with her coach and husband, Shane Tusup. First Relay to Australia: Australia won the women’s   relay in a world record time of 3:30. 65. The American team had the lead after two legs, but swimming third, Bronte Campbell cruised past Dana Vollmer to give her sister, Cate, the lead. The American team had Katie Ledecky on anchor, but she is better at longer distances, and could not pass the   freestyle favorite, Campbell. Despite their freestyle sprint excellence over the years, the Americans have not won this race since 2000. Horton Beats Sun: Mack Horton of Australia defeated the defending champion, Sun Yang, in the men’s   freestyle. The two rivals started slowly and were only 6th and 7th after 150 meters behind Britain’s James Guy, who raced to the lead in world record pace. But the favorites moved methodically up to the lead, blowing past the fading Guy. Horton always led Sun and won in 3:41. 55. Gabriele Detti of Italy was third, and the American Conor Dwyer, who had the fastest qualifying time, was fourth. Sun and Horton had developed a sharp rivalry this week. Sun splashed and taunted Horton in the practice pool, and Horton responded by calling Yang a “drug cheat. ” Sun served a   doping suspension in 2014. • Adam Peaty of Britain, the only man to break 58 seconds in the   breaststroke, lowered his world record in the preliminaries at the Olympic Aquatics Center on Saturday. Swimming well ahead of the field in smooth water, Peaty clocked a 57. 55 to lower his   record of 57. 92. The first gold medalist was a    West Virginia University sophomore, Virginia Thrasher. With two shots to go in the women’s air rifle event, Thrasher, who is known as Ginny, led by 0. 7 points. She coolly squeezed off shots of 10. 5 and 10. 4 to take gold. Two Chinese shooters, Du Li and favored Yi Siling won silver and bronze. Another American, Sarah Scherer was eighth. Thrasher has only been shooting for five years, after she asked her father to take her deer hunting. She was N. C. A. A. champion as a freshman and surprisingly qualified for the U. S. team at the Olympic Trials. “For me, it has been a whirlwind of a summer,” she said. She will also compete in the   rifle, three positions, next Saturday, then head back to W. V. U. “I get home 20 hours before the first class,” she said. “So I’ll be in physics at 8:30 a. m. ”In the afternoon shooting event, history was made when Vinh Xuan Hoang won the men’s air pistol. It was the first gold medal in any sport for Vietnam. “Making this gold medal is a life memory, never forget this,” Hoang said. “Because first time making a gold medal for Vietnam. ” • The U. S. women’s soccer survived a tough early challenge from France to win by  . The U. S. men’s basketball team, fresh from their stay on a luxury yacht, faced absolutely no challenge from China in a   destruction. • Women’s rugby arrived at the Olympics for the first time, in the form of rugby sevens. The United States split its two games, losing to Fiji, but beating Colombia. The women’s volleyball and field hockey teams won. • Venus Williams, gold medalist in 2000, was eliminated in the first round of the women’s singles by Kirsten Flipkens of Belgium. There are   athletes, and then there are the world’s best athletes. What’s the thing that separates the two? That’s what we set out to discover when planning for these Summer Games. It didn’t take us long to focus on Simone Biles, a        whirlwind who absolutely dominates the world of gymnastics. Watch this interactive to find out how she does it."
Russian ambassador denied meeting with Trump or campaign officials in October speech," (CNN) In an October speech to the Detroit Economic Club, Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, denied meeting with Donald Trump or campaign officials during the course of 2016 presidential election, but acknowledged that he met with members of Congress and others who approached him at events.  Kislyak spoke to the Detroit Economic Club on Oct. 27th of last year. CNN’s KFile obtained a DVD of his speech from Lawrence Technological University.  Contact between Russian officials and members of the Trump team have come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks as the FBI investigates Russia’s suspected interference in the 2016 election.  Kislyak was asked in Detroit whether his embassy had met with either of the political campaigns during the course of the election.  ”What do you call campaign?” he answered. ”I was invited for example to both conventions. I was, uh the first, that was the Republican convention, but then unexpectedly while being there, I was called back to Moscow for reason that has nothing to do with the elections. So I wasn’t there, but we had invitations to both.” Kislyak was then asked specifically if he had met with any Trump advisers or Trump himself at the convention in Cleveland.  ”No, but we met those people who came to see all the ambassadors who were sitting in a special lounge there specifically reserved for the diplomatic corp. and I was among those who were there talking to members of the Congress, to all the peoples who cared to come to us and talk to us,” he answered. Kislyak is considered by US intelligence officials as a top Russian spy recruiter in Washington, a claim Russian officials deny.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions met with Kislyak last September in Sessions’s DC office when he was still a US Senator and top Trump adviser. Sessions also interacted with Kislyak in Cleveland at a Heritage Foundation event held during the RNC in July. The revelation of the meetings, which ran counter to his denials during his confirmation hearing that he had met with Russian officials, led Sessions to recuse himself from any investigation involving the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia. Sessions says he doesn’t recall discussing the campaign with Kislyak at any of these meetings.  Kislyak was also present at a VIP reception last April for a foreign policy speech delivered by Trump at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington. The White House has said characterizations of Trump’s interactions with Kislyak at that event as a meeting are ”absurd.”  Ret. Lt. Gen Michael Flynn ultimately had to resign his post as Trump’s National Security Adviser after it was revealed he had contacts with the Russian ambassador in December about US sanctions on the country."
DNC Contender Ellison Holds Press Event With CAIR Radical - Breitbart,"The leading candidate to become the chairman of the Democratic Party shared his Capitol Hill press conference with a leading advocate for Islamic radicals, Nihad Awad, who is the director of the   Council on   Relations, or CAIR. [Candidate Rep. Keith Ellison’s decision to share the microphone with CAIR director on Wednesday afternoon highlights the willingness of party activists to deepen their alliance with the small number of radical Muslim voters living in the United States, despite the huge ideological conflicts between the party’s liberal base and the Muslim groups’ toxic Islamic ideology and aggressive Arab politics.  Ellison is a leading candidate to become chairman of the Democratic National Committee, who will be chosen by a party vote in late February. He has public support from the Democrats’ leader in the Senate. Sen. Chuck Schumer, but faces growing opposition from former labor secretary Tom Perez. The press conference was called to protest President Donald Trump’s popular policy to curb immigration of people with “hostile attitudes. ” Both Ellison and Awad insisted the hostile attitudes policy is   even though it only seeks to exclude people who: do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law   …     those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including “honor” killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation. Ellison is already facing criticism for his closeness to the Islamic groups. For example, the   League flipped from support to opposition. His public appearance with Awad could add to his political problems. In a Tweeted photograph from Ellison’s office, Awad is the partly bald man with a red scarf standing to left of the microphones.

Wikileaks: Starbucks CEO Warned Hillary of ’Stale’ Campaign,"Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz wrote to Hillary Clinton aide Cheryl Mills in July 2015 to warn that the Clinton campaign’s message “feels stale” and lacks “transparency” and “truth,” according to an email released by Wikileaks on Tuesday. [Schultz’s impassioned warning message, which Mills forwarded to Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri, also urged the Clinton campaign: “Reboot the look of it all and the overriding message before its to [sic] late. ”  At the time, there was speculation that Schultz, who has been critical of both parties, might run himself. Ultimately, Schultz endorsed Hillary Clinton, but not before delivering an impassioned warning to the Clinton campaign that it was out of touch. Schultz’s advice included: From the outside looking in, I see an old style start to the campaign that feels stale with very few signs of the kind of freshness and transparency that the American people (especially millennials) will need to trust and ultimately elect HRC as President.   …     She desperately needs the people on her side. And, although it’s early, the imprinting process has begun  …     And, I don’t like how it feels.   …     Her inner circle and the powers to be, need to reject the status quo, and understand how brands (and she is a brand) in the world we now live in are built. It requires a vision for the future that is steeped in truth and authenticity and builds an enduring emotional connection with the voters.   …     Substance absolutely matters, but so does the form it takes. The campaign feels “yesterday. ” It’s too packaged and prescribed. The American people are longing for truth and someone to believe in. Reboot the look of it all and the overriding message before its to late  …     Schultz also worried that “the media is not on her side,” though he may have been referring to the media’s interest in Clinton’s Democratic rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ). An analysis of campaign contributions in 2015 found Starbucks to be the most liberal coffee brand. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

Rudy Giuliani: ‘Democrats Should Apologize for Calling Donald Trump a Racist’ - Breitbart,"Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said instead of host Jake Tapper asking Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to apologize over his questions about President Barack Obama’s birthplace maybe the, “Democrats should apologize for calling Donald Trump a racist.’  Giuliani said, “If everybody apologized for all the things they said in politics, all we would be doing on television shows is apologizing. Maybe all the Democrats should apologize for calling Donald Trump a racist and calling him all kinds of terrible names and it gets a little silly. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN"
Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah dies," (CNN) Throngs of mourners gathered in Mecca early Friday just hours after Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz al Saud died. He was 90. Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz was appointed as the new king, state television reported.​ The announcement of Abdullah’s death comes several weeks after the   Saudi Press Agency said he was suffering from pneumonia and had been admitted to the hospital. Services will be held Friday afternoon at the Imam Turki Bin Abdullah Grand Mosque in Riyadh, and many world leaders are likely to pay their respects. Jordan’s King Abdullah cut short his visit to Davos, and is heading to Riyadh, according to a Jordanian government source.  ”King Abdullah’s life spanned from before the birth of modern Saudi Arabia through its emergence as a critical force within the global economy and a leader among Arab and Islamic nations,” U. S. President Barack Obama said in a statement. He praised Abdullah’s role in sponsoring the Arab Peace Initiative, which attempts to solve the   conflict between Israel and Palestine. ”This is a sad day. The United States has lost a friend, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Middle East, and the world has lost a revered leader,” U. S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement. ”He was so proud of the Kingdom’s journey, a brave partner in fighting violent extremism who proved just as important as a proponent of peace.” A cautious reformer, King Abdullah became king of the   nation, a key U. S. ally in the Middle East, in August 2005. But he had been running Saudi Arabia since 1996, after his   King Fahd’s stroke.  In the context of the kingdom’s conservative circles, Abdullah was seen as reformer and often came up against the more   clerics. Since ascending to the throne, Abdullah took steps toward broader freedoms and invested some of the country’s vast oil wealth in   education and infrastructure projects. ”He was really quite (an) extraordinary figure. He was probably the most progressive and liberal minded king of Saudi Arabia since King Faisal, which is a long time ago, in the early 1970s,” CNN’s Fareed Zakaria said about Abdullah, who he described as ”much loved.” ”I had the opportunity to meet with him once and what you got a sense of was somebody who really was determined to move his country forward,” Zakaria said. ”It’s a conservative country and a conservative society    and he kept emphasizing that to me    but he was very clear in the direction he wanted to go.” However, resistance from conservative factions hindered some of his efforts, leaving many women in particular disappointed by a lack of progress toward greater independence. What’s next? Under Abdullah’s leadership, the country slowly squashed al Qaeda, capturing or killing its leaders in the kingdom, forcing the remnants underground and sidelining radical preachers. It also took a more prominent role in international affairs. Last year, it became the lead Arab nation in a U. S.  coalition to eradicate the ultraradical ISIS group in Iraq and Syria. Analysts are predicting a smooth political transition despite the many challenges facing Saudi Arabia, including Iran, the rise of ISIS, the crisis in Yemen, and the drop in oil prices. Saudi Arabia has 16% of the world’s known oil reserves, according to the U. S. Energy Information Administration. The country is widely seen as the leader of OPEC and has a large influence on energy prices and political stability in the Middle East. ”Remember, the last time the price of oil fell like this, the Soviet Union collapsed,” said Zakaria. ”That said, the successor is a very competent man.” He added: ”I don’t expect any major shift, but it marks a big change, and we’ll have to see what the new king is like.” People we’ve lost in 2015"
FLYNN: Critics Call Nuclear Scientist Miss USA ’Dumb’ After She Disses Feminism and Calls Health Care a ’Privilege’ - Breitbart,"Kara McCullough made the Miss USA pageant great again —  just not in the way the contest’s organizers intended. [Twenty months after Donald Trump sold the contest to   the pageant made every effort to separate itself from its former owner —  a move not lost on the media covering the event. The Associated Press, for instance, reported: “The pageant included a field of five new immigrants who spoke on air about the importance of diversity  —   as if to refute US President Donald Trump’s less than welcoming stand toward some immigrants and refugees. ”  McCullough, an   born in Italy, looked the part but refused to play it this weekend. Miss D. C. rejected feminism for equality. “So as a woman scientist in the government, I’d like to lately transpose the word ‘feminism’ to ‘equalism,’” she explained. “I don’t really want to consider myself  —   try not to consider myself like this   you know, like, ‘Oh, I don’t really care about men.’ But one thing I’m going to say, though, is women, we are just as equal as men when it comes to opportunity in the workplace. ” She further ran afoul of the politically correct when she described health care as an earned “privilege” rather than an awarded “right. ” She told her questioners, “I’m definitely going to say it’s a privilege. As a government employee, I am granted health care. And I see firsthand that for one to have health care, you need to have jobs. ” She won the judges but lost the judgmental. Calling the   Miss USA’s answers “dumb” and “ill informed,” the appropriately named Linda Stasi of the New York Daily News charged that “McCullough did all women a disservice with her remarks on healthcare, but she did more damage with her dismissal of feminism. ” Other cultural commissars carped. It’s incredibly sad that in 2017, a woman is striving to occupy a position of influence   no understanding of what feminism is. #MissUSA,  —   courtney (@seecourttweet) May 15, 2017,  Dear #kara mccullough You are sadly mistaken. Everyone has a right to healthcare. Maybe you should be stripped of yours. The ACA helps many!  —   Kizzy (@TrulyKizzo) May 15, 2017,  Happy to see a woman of color crowned Miss USA two years in a row, but Kara McCullough has some problematic views on healthcare and feminism,  —   mama cass (@_femalien) May 15, 2017,  It’s a beauty pageant. The job requirements don’t call for a nuclear scientist. But it helps that Miss USA works a nuclear scientist."
Twitter Suspended An Autistic Man Who Tweets Otter Pictures After Spurious Copyright Complaints - Breitbart,"Andrew Gleason is an autistic webcomic writer who goes by the name “Otter Jesus” on Twitter. He spends a lot of time brightening up social media with pictures of otters. Or at least he did, until Twitter   his account. [Twitter told Gleason that he had been suspended for a “violent threat,” and screenshots of his old tweets do indeed show that he sometimes engaged in what can only be described as “ ” humor, including a joke about shooting up a tabletop gaming convention. If that Twitter did indeed ban Gleason for the    tweet, then it’s akin to the bizarre trial of Paul Chambers, a harmless London barrister who was put on criminal trial for joking about blowing up an airport.  Gleason claims that Twitter merely used his tweets as a pretext, however. In the days leading up to his suspension, he received several false copyright claims from a feminist artist, Rebecca Cohen a. k. a “Gynostar,” who Gleason was parodying in his webcomic series. According to Gleason, Twitter warned him that he would be suspended if he continued to parody her work, despite the fact that parodies are protected under copyright exception laws. It wouldn’t be the first time that Twitter has mysteriously put an account on lockdown over spurious feminist complaints. Because Twitter never comments on the reasons for suspending accounts, finding out the true reason behind their actions is, for now, impossible. Even if Twitter were given the benefit of the doubt, however, and the feminist’s complaints had nothing to do with Gleason’s suspension, their actions still raise questions. Twitter has allowed entirely   threats of political violence to remain on the platform when such threats come from progressives. And, as reported last month, death threats against Republican senators remained on the platform for weeks without being deleted. Yet Gleason, who has autism, was (allegedly) banned for making a poor taste joke. Not only does this raise questions about where Twitter places its priorities, but it also suggests the company is completely incapable of judging context, or correcting punishments that are the result of misunderstandings. Until Twitter takes context into account when enforcing its terms, then autistic people like Gleason, who are particularly prone to being misunderstood, or inadvertently breaking social conventions, are going to be particularly vulnerable to unfair suspension. It’s also worth noting that Twitter’s suspension of Gleason, who raises money for autism charities, severely hampers his fundraising abilities. Although he gained some exposure from the controversy, he now has to rebuild his social media following from scratch. It’s a good example of how social media suspensions, unfair or otherwise, can have a financial impact on an individual. But even   people are at risk from Twitter’s inability to take context into account. As Gleason says, “a friend could say, “I’m gonna kill you” and they could be suspended for that because the ToS doesn’t say jokes like that are violent threats. ” Of course, all this is giving Twitter the benefit of the doubt. It’s entirely possible that they’re just looking for excuses to suspend people who manage to offend the wrong feminist, or the wrong progressive activist.

Schweizer on Hillary’s Email: The Story Keeps Changing and It Doesn’t Make Sense - Breitbart,"Friday on Fox New Channel’s “America’s Newsroom,” while commenting on the State Department inspector general’s report that found Democratic   Hillary Clinton violated the agency rules by using a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state, “Clinton Cash” author Peter Schweizer argued her “story keeps changing” and that “it doesn’t make sense. ”  Schweizer said, “Here is the problem, the Clinton’s story keeps changing and it doesn’t make sense. One of the points they made repeatedly is they did this for convenience purposes. She wanted to use the Blackberry for convenience purposes. She wanted to merge these account for the sake of convince. But as Mr. Lucas points out in his deposition, because of the way security is handled in the State Department and you have purposeful dead zones where blackberries can’t be used. Secretary Clinton when she was in her office had to leave the office to go into the hallway to send and receive emails. That’s not convenient. Again and again they shifted the story and I think it will continue to get worse as it circle tightens further on the Clintons. ” He added, “The story is shifting   …     Keep in mind  she deleted more emails than they kept. So they are trying to argue that she actually sent more private and personal emails than they did on official business. There are gaps on the emails that are released. Despite the claims they made, they turned over all the professional emails they had. We know there were emails from General Petraeus that she never turned over that were personal. So as we get into the details, the problem gets more difficult for her. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN"
Jake Gyllenhaal to Star in Broadway Revival of ‘Sunday in the Park’ - The New York Times,"Jake Gyllenhaal will return to Broadway next year in a brief revival of “Sunday in the Park With George. ” The production, a more fully developed version of a   City Center benefit concert that Mr. Gyllenhaal anchored in October, will be the first show in 49 years at Hudson Theater, which is being reconverted into a stage after decades of other uses. Mr. Gyllenhaal’s concert performances wowed critics and sold out. “This is one of those shows that seems destined to be forever spoken of with   bragging rights by anyone who sees it,” Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times. Mr. Gyllenhaal’s City Center   Annaleigh Ashford, will join him on Broadway. The production will be shorter than the usual Broadway run, at 10 weeks, with previews beginning Feb. 11 and the opening on Feb. 23 it will close on April 23. The show will be produced by Ambassador Theater Group, the British company that is restoring the theater for Broadway, along with New York City Center Jeanine Tesori, who produced the City Center staging and Riva Marker, who runs Mr. Gyllenhaal’s company, Nine Stories Productions. The short run in a   theater will make it difficult to recoup capitalization costs, but a spokeswoman said that the company believed it could be done. The company has been eager to land a starry first production that would bring attention to the theater, which is on West 44th Street and most recently has been used as a hotel event space. The spokeswoman said that the Broadway staging would be “fully memorized,” unlike the concert, and that the show’s sets and costumes would be “deepened. ” “Sunday in the Park With George,” with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book by James Lapine, is one of the most beloved musicals in the canon, and in 1985 it won the Pulitzer Prize for drama. The show, inspired by the painting “A Sunday on La Grande Jatte,” has a first act imagining the artwork’s creation by the painter Georges Seurat, and a second act, set a century later, imagining the artistic struggles of the painter’s  . The revival will be directed by Sarna Lapine, who is Mr. Lapine’s niece, and who will be making her Broadway debut as a director. She directed the City Center concert performance, and has been associate or assistant director on other Broadway shows. “Sunday in the Park” was first presented on Broadway in 1984 there was a revival in 2008. Mr. Gyllenhaal, whose only previous Broadway role was last year in the play “Constellations,” will play Seurat and his   (Georges and George). Ms. Ashford, who won a Tony Award last year for her role in “You Can’t Take It With You,” will play Seurat’s lover, Dot, as well as their daughter, Marie. The rest of the cast has not been announced. Mr. Gyllenhaal, a frequent film star, previously agreed to star in a play, “Burn This,” that was to have opened the theater but postponed, citing unspecified scheduling conflicts. He was able to do “Sunday” instead because it requires less of a time commitment."
Mexican Brewery Portrays Trump as Gun-slinging Nazi Mariachi,"A new Mexican beer has a label depicting a   gloomy, mariachi President Donald Trump with a swastika belt buckle. [The “Amigous Cerveza” beer  has the word “amigo” misspelled to allegedly make fun of a mispronunciation of the word by Americans, reported Reuters.  The back label of the brew says the Republican president should be “in a mad house, not the White House. ” The chief executive of brewery, Casa Cervecera Cru Cru, Luis Enrique de la Reguera, was reported to be surprised with the success of the product. The original production was gone within a week. “We knew that a Trump label was going to be controversial, but it’s been selling extremely fast,” he said. Cru Cru designed the beer: similar to a New England pale ale with a hint of mango. The idea came to Cru Cru and his partner in Mexico, Error de Diciembre and Epic Brewing, before the presidential election. The Cru Cru team took to Instagram to wish President Trump a happy birthday. Best birthday ever   …     HBP! A post shared by ima_lore (@ima_lore) on May 25, 2017 at 8:42am PDT,  The Republican angered some when during his speech announcing his run for the presidency in June 2015 he said: When do we beat Mexico at the border? They’re laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they’re killing us economically. The U. S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems. Thank you. It’s true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we’re getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They’re sending us not the right people. It’s coming from more than Mexico. It’s coming from all over South and Latin America, and it’s coming probably —   probably —   from the Middle East. But we don’t know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don’t know what’s happening. And it’s got to stop and it’s got to stop fast. Virginia Senator Tim Kaine later claimed, “As a candidate, [Donald Trump] started his campaign where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals. ” As reported by Breitbart: Trump was referring to illegal aliens coming over the U. S.  border who commit additional crimes, such as rape. As Breitbart Texas has extensively documented, it’s common for human traffickers to “to sexually assault or rape the females” en route to the U. S. and the smugglers “usually remove an article of clothing from the female they rape and they tie it tightly to a tree —  a rape tree. ” Furthermore, it is true that as the U. S. suffers from a massive heroin epidemic that killed over 47, 000 people in 2014 alone, “nearly all” of the heroin consumed in the U. S. is smuggled in by Mexican traffickers, as the Washington Post found. Drug trafficking is an inherently violent operation.

Video purportedly showing US payment to Iran emerges,"Washington  (CNN) A video emerged Friday that purportedly shows a US payment of $400 million worth of cash delivered to Iran on the day Tehran released several American prisoners in January. CNN cannot authenticate the newly surfaced video, which was part of an Iranian documentary that first aired in January and shows the money on pallets in a warehouse. But the latest wrinkle is bound to fuel critics of the administration who have accused Obama of providing ransom to the Iranian government in exchange for the release of four US prisoners. A fifth American was released separately. The Obama administration has vehemently denied any connection between the cash delivery and the release of the American prisoners.  ”We announced these payments in January. Many months ago. They were not a secret,” Obama told reporters at the Pentagon Thursday. ”It was not a nefarious deal,” Obama said, adding, ”We do not pay ransom for hostages.” However, US officials, while denying a connection, have publicly admitted that the timing of the two transactions    US prisoners leaving Iran as hundreds of millions of dollars arrived    involved problematic optics. Others have raised questions as to whether the release of the Americans was conditional upon the payment of the money and whether it encourages more questionable arrests by Iran of Americans living there. A US official told CNN that is was ”unknowable” whether Iran would have freed the prisoners without the settlement payment. And an Obama administration official insisted Saturday that the release of Iranian nationals from US prisons as part of the swap for the incarcerated US citizens was ”not conditional on any payment. Their release was conditional on the series of commutations and pardons (the Department of Justice) spoke to at the time.” Trump walks back video claim, The revelation came hours after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump walked back an earlier claim that he had seen tape of the delivery, acknowledging Friday morning that the footage he watched was actually the American captives arriving in Geneva. Trump’s repeated reference to having seen the video was widely questioned, since at the time no such footage had been identified. Trump initially claimed to have seen video of the cash being unloaded from a US aircraft in Iran and repeated the assertion on Thursday even though a campaign aide had told The Washington Post earlier that it was actually footage of a different event. Trump then said via Twitter Friday that he had only seen the American prisoners arriving in Geneva, Switzerland.   Democratic vice presidential candidate and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine slammed Trump for his earlier claim, saying, ”I have no idea what he’s talking about. It (the video) doesn’t exist. He might be thinking about   from like 35 years ago or something like this,” while appearing on CBS’ ”This Morning.”  The footage Trump referred to featured a plane, while the video from the Iranian documentary shows only the pallets stacked with cash, according to Iranian state television. The January deal, well publicized at the time, was officially part of a $1. 7 billion settlement involving a dispute dating back to a   failed arms deal with the government of the Shah of Iran. US officials have said that the settlement and subsequent release of frozen Iranian assets was agreed to in order to avoid a potentially more costly international arbitration."
France Investigates Champs Elysees Attacker as Vote Looms,"PARIS (AFP)  —   French investigators were Saturday probing the background of the jihadist who shot dead a policeman on Paris’s prestigious Champs Elysees avenue as a jittery nation drew breath on the eve of the first round of a   presidential election. [Candidates have clashed over how to protect France since Thursday night’s shooting, which the Islamic State (IS) group claimed as the work of one of its devotees.  Analysts say the attack could shake up the   contest between right wing leader Marine Le Pen, centrist Emmanuel Macron, conservative Francois Fillon and   firebrand   Melenchon. A note praising IS was found next to the body of    gunman Karim Cheurfi, who shot dead an officer and wounded two others before being killed in a firefight that sent tourists on the   boulevard rushing for cover. The violent scenes thrust security to the fore of campaigning after nine months of relative calm. Le Pen, Fillon and Macron cancelled their final rallies Friday. Le Pen has moved quickly to present herself as the strongest defender against Islamist radicals in a country scarred by a string of attacks that have claimed 239 lives since 2015. The    leader of the   National Front (FN) called for France to “immediately” take back control of its borders from the European Union and deport all foreigners on a terror watchlist. “This war against us is ceaseless and merciless,” she said, accusing the Socialist government of a “cowardly” response to the threat. Fillon and Macron also hastily convened televised briefings in which they vowed to protect the country. “Some haven’t taken the full measure of the evil,”    Fillon said, promising an “ ” approach. Macron, a    moderate whom Fillon has portrayed as too inexperienced for the top job, said France was paying for the intelligence jobs cuts made when Fillon was prime minister between 2007 and 2012. Describing the Champs Elysees shooting as an attack on democracy, he urged voters: “Do not give in to fear. ” Veteran   Melenchon, 65, was the only one of the four to stick to his schedule. A BVA poll conducted on Thursday and Friday showed Le Pen and Macron tied on 23 percent, ahead of Melenchon with 19. 5 percent and Fillon on 19 percent.  —   ‘No signs of radicalisation’  —   Cheurfi drew up alongside a police van and shot an officer sitting at the wheel, sending shoppers and strollers on the ritzy Champs Elysees scattering for safety. He was killed while trying to flee on foot. A German tourist was slightly wounded in the crossfire. A statement by IS’s propaganda agency Amaq issued shortly after the attack identified the assailant as “Abu Yussef the Belgian”. The claim had raised concerns that a possible second attacker could be on the loose. French authorities said a man sought in Belgium, who was suspected of having planned to travel to France on Thursday, had handed himself in to police in the Belgian city of Antwerp. Cheurfi was arrested in February on suspicion of plotting to kill police officers but released because of a lack of evidence. A serial offender, he spent nearly 14 years in prison for a range of crimes including attacks on the police. He had shown “no signs of radicalisation” while in custody, said France’s   prosecutor Francois Molins.  —   ‘Exploiting’ attack  —   The shooting came days after two men were arrested in Marseille on suspicion of planning an imminent attack and follows a series of deadly strikes around Europe in the past month, targeting Stockholm, London and the Saint Petersburg metro. On Sunday, around 50, 000 police and 7, 000 soldiers will be deployed to protect voters. Until now, surveys showed the French to be more concerned about jobs and the economy than terrorism or security, though analysts warned Thursday’s shooting could change that. US President Donald Trump tweeted that the attack “will have a big effect” on the election. “If it were to benefit someone that would clearly be Marine Le Pen who has dominated this issue throughout the campaign, or Francois Fillon, because of his stature of statesman,” Adelaide Zulfikarpasic of BVA pollsters said. Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve accused Le Pen of attempting to make political hay out of the killing, saying she was “seeking, as she does after every tragedy, to take advantage of it”.  —   Chaotic scenes  —   Shop owners and restaurant managers shepherded their customers to backrooms and basements when the shooting began on the Champs Elysees. “We heard the shots and people were running in every direction. But people were calm,” said Lebanese tourist Zeina Bitar, 45, who was shopping with her children nearby. France has been under a state of emergency for nearly a year and a half. The string of terror attacks began in January 2015 with a massacre at the offices of the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine. The following November, IS gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people in Paris, and a Tunisian man rammed a truck through crowds in Nice last July, killing 86 people."
New York Times: Unease Over Mass Migration Is Spawning ’Far-Right’,"The New York Times has published a scathing profile of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, Frauke Petry, describing the   leader as “ ”. [The paper repeated claims by the German establishment press, including that Petry was a member of a club of “preachers of hatred” and that she had condoned illegal migrants being shot at the border. An extract is reproduced here:  MANNHEIM, Germany  —   In the current tussle for the future of Germany, Frauke Petry is what you might call the   Merkel. Where Ms. Merkel, the chancellor, has welcomed refugees, Ms. Petry, a rising   leader, has said border guards might need to turn guns on anyone crossing a frontier illegally. Where Ms. Merkel has urged tolerance, Ms. Petry has embraced the angry populism now running through Europe and the United States. “The preachers of hatred” was how the news weekly Der Spiegel characterized the new German right on its cover last month, emblazoned with a portrait of the petite Ms. Petry. But this brisk, garrulous    is more than Ms. Merkel’s foil. She is a disruptive, new force on the German political scene. She and her party, the Alternative for Germany, have ridden a wave of discontent over the chancellor’s embrace of more than one million refugees to their strongest poll ratings ever. They are now roiling Germany’s placid,   politics and threatening to alter its political landscape as insurgent parties have done in less stable or prosperous countries around Europe. Not unlike Donald J. Trump in the United States, she is also breaking open a political dialogue and liberating a new and impolitic  —   critics say racist  —   language in the mainstream. “The power of the established parties is crumbling,” a jubilant Ms. Petry told supporters after her party took 13. 2 percent of the vote in normally sleepy local elections in the central state of Hesse last Sunday. This Sunday is another test, with elections in three larger and more important states  —   one in the east and two in the west  —   that are being closely watched as a referendum on the chancellor’s refugee policies and a bellwether for the nation. In the east, support for the Alternative for Germany now nears 20 percent  —   about double that in the west. But even in the west, the   rebellion is chipping away at the chancellor’s conservative Christian Democrats, as well as its Social Democratic coalition partners, in a country where the Nazi past looms large.

"Pope Speaks Out Against Manufacturing Plants, Calls Them Workplace Slavery","CIUDAD JUAREZ, Chihuahua  —   In front of a large audience of manufacturing leaders, Pope Francis I spoke out against focusing on the bottom line instead of on the lives of the workers. [“God will settle the score with the slavers of our day,” the Pope said.   The comments came when the Catholic Church’s top official visited this border city, considered to be an industrial hub that provides materials and workforce for both sides of the border.  “There is a special relation that this city has with the world of jobs,” Pope Francis I said. “Because of this place, we need to foster debate and relations to create a better future. ”  According to the Pope one of the harshest blows to Ciudad Juarez is the lack of employment opportunities. Pope Francis also cited the lack of education which perpetuates the cycle of poverty and marginalization.  “This poverty is the best recipe for young men to fall in the cycle of drug trafficking and violence,” the Pope said. As manufacturing leaders looked on, Pope Francis I spoke out against the “paradigm of economic utilities as the basis of modern relations”.  By focusing on the bottom line and in the maximum profit, the ethical dimensions of businesses becomes lost, he said.  “They forget that the best investment is to invest in people,” Pope Francis said. “The current mentality exploits employees. They use them, abuse them and dump them. God will settle the score with the slavers of our day. ” According to the Pope, the flow of moneys can not determine the flow of life and the flow of individuals. He added that the modern social doctrine of the church is to look out for individuals who are threatened. The doctrine will push for fair wages, just employment, a roof to sleep under, time to spend with family.  “The doctrine will be prophetic. It will help us to not get lost in the seductive sea of ambition,” the Pope said. “This is not against anyone but in favor of everyone. ” Ildefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas you can follow him on Twitter and on Facebook."
Calais Mayor Bans Food Distribution in Bid to Quell Migrants,"The Mayor of Calais has banned food distribution to migrants in the city in a bid to prevent yet another ‘Jungle’ migrant camp from springing up. [Visiting Calais on Wednesday, the French Interior Minister, Bruno Le Roux, said no new shelters would be set up in the vicinity to avoid drawing migrants back to the port city.  But he made it clear that the distribution of food would not be prohibited by the state  —   an assertion Mayor Natascha Bouchard moved quickly to counter, arguing that food distribution also acted as a draw. On Thursday, officials placed posters around the site of the old Jungle shanty town issuing a mayoral decree banning the “regular, persistent and large presence of individuals distributing meals to migrants” to maintain peace and security in the area. It also prevents “repeated, prolonged gatherings” of people, effectively preventing charities from setting up food distribution points which draw crowds. The decree was rapidly enforced one volunteer has told The Guardian that police fired teargas at charity workers and migrants during a breakfast distribution on Thursday morning. “They wanted to stop the distribution, and they wanted to stop people from sleeping in the area,” said Sarah Arrom, who volunteers with Utopia56. “There has never been teargas before when we’ve been trying to hand out food. ” Migrants have been flocking to the northern town for nearly two decades in a bid to gain passage to the UK via the Channel Tunnel and ferry crossings to Dover. In 1999, the French Red Cross opened a migrant reception centre at Sangatte, but it quickly became overcrowded prompting migrants to set up various Jungle camps in the surrounding woods, relocating when the police moved them on. Sangatte was closed in 2002 by the then President Nicolas Sarkozy on request by the British Labour government, having housed some 67, 000 migrants during its three years  —   but the migrants remained. The first official Jungle made headlines in 2008 when a British journalism student was subject to a “particularly brutal” gang rape by migrants while attempting to write a story on those drawn to the region. The following year saw two operations to bulldoze the tents and structures erected by the 800 or so migrants living there, but again the migrants drifted back, numbers rising steadily. It was the 2015 migrant crisis which supercharged the Jungle, sending migrant numbers spiralling as high as 10, 000, while the camp took on the characteristics of a shanty town complete with bars, shops, restaurants, churches, and a school. January 2016 saw the partial demolishment of the town, the wooden structures replaced with shipping containers offering dry, warm beds and electricity for 1, 500 migrants. By October, the remainder of the camp had been demolished and thousands of migrants bussed out to migrant reception centres across France. Within weeks, the migrants began to return. Despite the police running a “zero tolerance operation” rounding up migrants for relocation to regional reception centres, Utopia56 says it now distributes 250 meals a night. Refugee Community Kitchen and Help Refugees make a further 400 meals a day, according to Renke Meuwese, who works with both charities. But Bouchart is determined to prevent a return to the Jungle’s heydey. “We have already suffered too much,” she said."
TRUMP: ’I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools’ my first day in the White House,"’  mogul Donald Trump ended his   campaign rally by calling for an end to     zones on schools and US military bases.’ ’”I will get rid of   zones on schools  —   you have to  —   and on military bases on my first day. It gets signed my first day,” the Republican presidential   told his supporters in Burlington, Vermont.’ ’”You know what a   zone is to a sicko?” Trump asked. ”That’’s bait. ”’ ”Trump’s rally was occurring at the same time as US President Barack Obama’s televised   forum addressing gun violence. Obama has repeatedly called for   measures after recent mass shootings and  to expand background checks on gun buyers, among other things.” ’But Trump argues that more people need to be carrying arms to protect the innocent.’ ’His allusion to   military bases was apparently a reference to the attacks against two military installations in Chattanooga, Tennessee, last July. His   schools comment could have been referring to the mass shooting at an Oregon community college last October, though concealed firearms .’ ”But far more of Trump’s Thursday   discussion was about the recent terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, and Paris. Both of those incidents, he suggested, would have been easily thwarted if those areas had looser   laws and an armed public.” ’”They walk into a number of places in France, and they say, ’’Get over. ’’ Boom. ’’Get over. ’’ Boom. ’’Get over. ’’ Boom. Nobody had a gun on the other side,” Trump recalled. If the people there were armed, he said, ”It’’s a whole different outcome. It’’s a whole different deal. ”’ ’He added: ”You’’ll have bad stuff happening, but at least we’’re shooting back. And we’’re going down shooting. ”’"
Leftist German News Outlet: Milo Is Donald Trump’s Finest Hatemonger - Breitbart,"Stern, a left leaning weekly German magazine, published an article titled “Donald Trump’s Finest Hatemonger” about Breitbart Senior Editor Milo Yiannopoulos. [The article describes Breitbart as an “extreme right ‘shoutsite’” and claims that Breitbart is “notorious for conspiracy theories and slander. ” Describing Milo, the article claims:  For a year the Brit has been writing regularly for the   ‘shoutsite’ “Breitbart. com” whose former chief now works for and advises Donald Trump. “Breitbart” is notorious for twisted conspiracy theories and slander. His new publicist home, so said Yiannopoulos once, would be the “Central for free speech” where people would talk about what people really were interested in: “Freedom, love, sex, death, money and porn. ” Laurie Penny, author and feminist is the opposite of M. Y. doesn’t believe in his talk of the threatened free speech. The article further seems to imply that Milo makes his money using hate and fear: Yiannopoulos himself says: “We live in a   era and that is wonderful. ”   is one of those new words, that explain phenomenons like Trump and AfD (Alternative für Deutschland): It doesn’t matter around the truth as such, only about how its being perceived by other people. In other words: How many       really live in the neighbourhood doesn’t interest anyone. Only that people are scared of them. These feelings are exploited by right demagogues  like Yiannopoulos for their purposes. Their paycheck is made in attention and whoever is the loudest is the richest.

Scripps National Spelling Bee ends on historic note for the 3rd consecutive year,"’’ ’OXON HILL, Maryland  —   The words were tougher. The final rounds lasted longer. The result was the same.’ ’The Scripps National Spelling Bee ended in a tie for the third consecutive year Thursday night, with Jairam Hathwar and Nihar Janga declared cochampions after a   finish.’ ’Jairam, 13, is the younger brother of the 2014 cochampion Sriram Hathwar. Nihar, at age 11, is the youngest winner of the bee on record.’ ’”I’’m just speechless. I can’’t say anything,” Nihar said as he hoisted the trophy. ”I mean, I’’m only in fifth grade! ”’ ’Scripps made the bee tougher after two consecutive ties, forcing the last two spellers to get through three times as many words as in years past.’ ’Jairam misspelled two words, but Nihar followed up with a miss both times and the bee continued. Sriram also got a word wrong during his bee, but his eventual cochampion, Ansun Sujoe, also followed up with a miss.’ ’Each will receive a trophy and $45, 000 in cash and prizes.’ ’In another change, bee organizers didn’’t stick to a predetermined list of 25 ”championship words” for the last two or three spellers. No one will know whether the bee had harder words in reserve, but former spellers said Jairam and Nihar nailed the toughest words in recent memory.’ ’”It was insane,” Jairam said.’ ’Because the best spellers become fluent in Latin and Greek roots, the bee went to words derived from trickier or more obscure languages, including Afrikaans, Danish, Irish Gaelic, Maori, and Mayan.’ ’’ ”Jairam’s winning word was Feldenkrais, which is derived from a trademark and means a system of body movements intended to ease tension.

"Hillary Clinton, Obama Both in Martha’s Vineyard After Louisiana Paper Demands POTUS Visit - Breitbart","President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are now both on Martha’s Vineyard as former President Bill Clinton prepares to celebrate his 70th birthday on the island. [It is unclear whether the Obamas will attend Clinton’s birthday party, which according to a Clinton aide will include “family and friends. ”  Obama has spent most of his vacation time on the island golfing and spending late nights out with friends, while Hillary Clinton has remained on the campaign trail. Clinton’s visit to Martha’s Vineyard comes after the Baton Rouge Advocate penned an editorial asking President Obama to appear in Louisiana for the sake of residents suffering from historic floods. Now that the flood waters ravaging Louisiana are receding, it’s time for President Barack Obama to visit the most anguished state in the union. Last week, as torrential rains brought death, destruction and misery to Louisiana, the president continued his vacation at Martha’s Vineyard, a playground for the posh and  . We’ve seen this story before in Louisiana, and we don’t deserve a sequel. In 2005, a   by a vacationing President George W. Bush became a symbol of official neglect for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. The current president was among those making political hay out of Bush’s aloofness. Sometimes, presidential visits can get in the way of emergency response, doing more harm than good. But we don’t see that as a factor now that flood waters are subsiding, even if at an agonizing pace. It’s past time for the president to pay a personal visit, showing his solidarity with suffering Americans. Thursday night, the president and the First Lady were out until nearly midnight at the Beach Road restaurant. Obama also spent the afternoon on his ninth round of golf in the 14 days he has been on vacation. Obama’s vacation schedule today has been empty, prompting speculation from reporters that the president may end up at the Clinton Birthday party. On Friday afternoon, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his running mate Mike Pence landed in Baton Rouge to visit flood victims. On Monday, the president attended a fundraiser for Clinton, praising her warmly and urging Democrats to “run scared” against Donald Trump. “It is absolutely critical that we have a capable, visionary, hardworking, diligent, smart, tenacious leader in the Oval Office,” he said. “And that’s Hillary Clinton. That’s who she is. ”"
Opinion: Women were ’examined like cattle’," (CNN) Nothing prepared me for what I saw and heard when I visited refugees from the conflict with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. As I traveled to Iraq and Syria, and to neighboring countries of Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey to meet with refugees and displaced women, I heard firsthand the horrifying stories of how they have been targeted in this conflict. I was told, for example, how mothers with babies were separated out by members of ISIL (also known as ISIS) because it is the younger women who they want to take. I heard how these younger women are examined to see if they are virgins, and how the younger and prettier they are, the more likely they are to get taken to ISIL’s headquarters in Raqqa. And I heard how the rest are taken to open markets, where they will end up being auctioned after being examined like cattle. I was in the Middle East as the special representative of the secretary general on sexual violence in conflict, and while I had been monitoring the situation since the crisis began, this was the first time I was able to visit those who have been disproportionately affected by the conflict. The refugees and displaced women and girls I met told me how sexual violence is being committed strategically, in a systematic manner, and with a high degree of sophistication by most of the parties to the conflicts. Indeed, as I moved from country to country, I came to the terrible conclusion that this is in essence a war on women and girls, a group that finds itself under assault every day, and every step of the way, whether it be in areas of active conflict, those under control of armed actors, or at checkpoints and border crossings. But while it is true that most parties to the conflict are committing sexual violence, it is extremist groups like ISIL that have been particularly public and shameless in institutionalizing sexual violence and engaging in the brutalization of women and girls as a tactic of terror to advance their key strategic objectives.    ISIS: Enslaving, having sex with ’unbelieving’ women, girls is OK, For a start, it is clear that ISIL has been working to increase recruitment by promising male fighters access to women and girls. In addition, the group has been raising funds through the sale of women and girls in slave markets and through ransoms paid by relatives. And the group has also been using sexual violence to displace populations, while also using the threat of sexual violence to extract information for intelligence purposes.     Women and girls I spoke with described being treated as property to be owned and traded, or else as vessels for producing children for fighters. In ISIL strongholds in Syria and Iraq, Raqqa and Mosul, women and girls are held in houses and buildings before they are inspected, selected and sold in ”bazaars” where prices can be negotiated. Simply put, we have been witnessing the revival of the slave trade in the 21st century.    What can and should we do? Such extreme violence requires political and security responses, but also legal and social response.    For a start, all parties to the conflicts, both state and nonstate actors, have an obligation under international humanitarian law to prevent and punish such crimes. Second, U. N. agencies need greater support to be able to provide the necessary assistance and to be able to respond to the needs of the affected population, particularly women and girls who are suffering even in the places where they are seeking refuge. The reality is that the humanitarian appeals dealing with the provision of services to sexual violence survivors are underfunded, and neighboring countries are now also under tremendous pressure. Greater support is therefore needed not only for programs for refugees, but also to support host communities of neighboring countries that have absorbed an estimated 80% of the refugees. ’Treated like cattle’: Yazidi women sold, raped, enslaved by ISIS, To address the transnational nature of ISIL, and the   dimensions of the conflicts raging in the region, a concerted regional and international response is required, including improved information sharing across countries and a common counterterrorism response with women’s protection and empowerment at its heart.   Such a response should also look at the root causes of violent extremism, something that we cannot ignore any longer. Preventing abuses will require deeper engagement with communities, including with traditional and religious leaders who can help break the silence surrounding sexual violence and ensure that it is the perpetrators who are shamed and stigmatized, not the victims. In fact, if there was a glimmer of hope during my visit, it was the statement issued by the supreme spiritual leader of the Yazidi community, who said that women and girls released from ISIL captivity should be embraced and reintegrated by their families and communities. Countering ISIL’s violent ideology will mean accepting these women and girls    and any children they may have    in a spirit of tolerance, dignity and respect.    Ultimately, we cannot beat ISIL without understanding who they are, where they come from, and what their ideology is. The group presents a very formidable enemy, one that we must fight together.

Federer not certain of competing at French Open," (CNN) Will he? Won’t he? Roger Federer has cast an element of doubt over whether he will compete in the tennis season’s second grand slam    next month’s French Open. The Swiss great told CNN Sport that missing the second major of the year to extend his current break from the Tour was ”still an option right now” and he will make a firm decision just before the French Open starts. Federer, who missed six months of last season with a knee injury, surprised the tennis world in March by announcing he would take eight weeks off to recover from a fairytale start to the year.  At 35, and having won the three biggest titles of the year to date    the Australian Open, Indian Wells and the Miami Open    the   grand slam champion decided he needed to rest and would return to action two weeks before the start of the French Open on May 22.  But Federer, who has won the French Open once, in 2009, told CNN Sport: ”I don’t think I will skip it, but I will have to see in, say, four or five weeks how I feel when I get on the clay, how my mood is. ”If I feel like I’m not 100% in it, that I’m (not) really fired up    and I believe that is something possible    then it is better to skip it.  ”But then I think maybe the break is a long one. It will be 10 weeks until the grass    that could be a bit long, but I will make a definite decision in five weeks. But I think I will play the French.” READ: Federer announces   break, READ: Federer wins 18th grand slam, Federer not aiming to be No. 1  Last month the world No. 4 revealed his physiotherapist had advised him not to play too many matches on clay because of the impact the demanding red dirt would have on his knee.  He had, after all, taken an enforced six months off after Wimbledon last year because of an injury which had threatened to end his glorious career.  After winning the Miami Open in March, his 20th match of the season, Federer said his body and his mind needed time away from the grueling Tour.  Federer, outside the world’s top 10 before his incredible Australian Open triumph in January, has climbed to No. 4 in the world rankings, having suffered defeat just once this year.  The Swiss will not currently play enough matches to close the big gap between him and world No. 1 Andy Murray, who is six years his junior. In fact, these days Federer is less concerned about his ranking and has no intention of changing his schedule in a bid to knock Murray off the top spot. ”I just don’t think I can,” said Federer, speaking before his exhibition match with Murray for the Swiss’ foundation earlier this month.  ”I would like to. At 23 years old, absolutely, you can start saying I’ll play the last 20 tournaments of the season if it helps with me getting a better chance with the world No. 1.  ”That’s exactly, though, when I get injured. That’s exactly when I burn out and that’s exactly when it all ends so that’s exactly why I did take a break for six to seven weeks and just really relax the body again.  ”I also said the mind needs a break, the stress and pressure that I have every single day from playing is a lot.  ”I won’t change anything. If it happens great, but I really think it’s a long, long shot. But, who knows. I really hope I can do very well at Wimbledon and the US Open this year.” Visit cnn.  for more news and videos, ’I hope to retire on my own terms’ It is at Wimbledon, not the French Open, where Federer is more likely to claim his 19th grand slam.  Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Murray will be above him in the pecking order in Paris on a surface he has not always enjoyed playing on.  But even if he did win a record eighth Wimbledon title, Federer said he had no plans to retire.  Should Federer compete at the French Open? Have your say on CNN Sport’s Facebook page.  ”Honestly, I wish I knew a date, where I said ’okay this is going to be my last tournament,’ then I could plan my whole life around it, but I don’t,” he said.  ”I want to leave it open. We’ll see what happens, see what I feel. I just hope when I leave, I can do it on my terms.”"

Feminists Sue University for Failing to Protect Them from Mean Internet Comments - Breitbart,"A feminist student group at the University of Mary Washington has filed a Title IX lawsuit against the institution for failing to protect them from mean comments on the internet. [Feminists United, a student group at the University of Mary Washington, has claimed in a recently filed lawsuit that the administration failed to protect them from posts made on the anonymous social media app, Yik Yak.  The suit alleges that the university failed to protect the students by refusing to ban access to the app via the university’s wifi system. The complaint ignores the reality that most students have access to the app via LTE internet service on their cellular devices, which would render a ban on the university’s wifi system almost worthless. The students claim that the university’s decision to allow students to access the app via the school’s wifi network fostered a hostile environment in which the students were subjected to “overtly    ” anonymous messages. Writing on the lawsuit for the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) Susan Kruth argued that the university did not violate Title IX policies by refusing to act on comments made on the anonymous app, Yik Yak, which was recently shut down in May."

Suicide Bombing in Baghdad Kills at Least 36 - The New York Times,"BAGHDAD  —   A suicide bomber detonated a pickup truck loaded with explosives on Monday in a busy Baghdad market, killing at least 36 people hours after President François Hollande of France arrived in the Iraqi capital. The Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack. The bomb went off in a produce market that was packed with day laborers, a police officer said, adding that another 52 people were wounded. During a news conference with Mr. Hollande, Haider   Iraq’s prime minister, said the suicide bomber had pretended to be a man seeking to hire day laborers. Once the workers gathered around, he detonated the vehicle. The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, claimed the attack in a statement circulated on a website that is often used by the group. It was the third such attack in three days in or near Baghdad, underscoring the lingering threat posed by the extremist group despite a string of setbacks for it elsewhere in the country over the past year, including in and around the northern city of Mosul. The attack took place in Sadr City, a vast Shiite district in eastern Baghdad that has been repeatedly targeted by Sunni extremists since the 2003   invasion. Militiamen loyal to the Shiite cleric Moktada   were seen evacuating bodies in their trucks before ambulances arrived. Bodies were scattered across the bloody pavement alongside fruit, vegetables and laborers’ shovels and axes. A minibus filled with dead passengers was on fire. Asaad Hashim, 28, an owner of a nearby cellphone store, described how the laborers had pushed and shoved around the bomber’s vehicle, trying to get hired. “Then a big boom came, sending them up into the air,” said Mr. Hashim, who suffered shrapnel wounds to his right hand. He blamed “the most ineffective security forces in the world” for failing to prevent the attack. An angry crowd cursed the government, even after a representative of Mr. Sadr tried to calm them. Late last month, the Iraqi authorities started removing some of the security checkpoints in Baghdad in a bid to ease traffic for the capital’s six million residents. “We have no idea who will kill at any moment and who’s supposed to protect us,” said Ali Abbas, a    father of four who was hurled over his vegetable stand by the blast. “If the securities forces can’t protect us, then allow us to do the job. ” Several smaller bombings elsewhere in the city on Monday killed at least 20 civilians and wounded at least 70, according to medics and police officials. All officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters. The United States State Department condemned the attacks. Separately, the American military announced on Monday the death of a coalition service member in Iraq in a “  incident,” without providing further details. Mr. Hollande met with Mr. Abadi and President Fuad Masum, and later traveled to the   northern Kurdish region to meet with French troops and local officials. He pledged to help displaced Iraqis return to Mosul, where Iraqi forces are waging a large offensive against the Islamic State. France is part of the   coalition formed in 2014 to fight the Islamic State after the extremist group seized large areas in Iraq and neighboring Syria. France has suffered multiple attacks claimed by the extremist group."
Andrea Constand’s ’courage’ buoys spirits of Cosby accusers," (CNN) Women who have accused comedian Bill Cosby of sexual assault appeared optimistic Saturday despite their disappointment that a mistrial was declared in the criminal case against the comedian. For them, the public fight in court against the powerful entertainer represented a new era in the battle against sexual assault. ”He thought he could bury us,” accuser Linda Kirkpatrick said of Cosby outside the courtroom in Norristown, Pennsylvania.  ”He didn’t know we were seeds. We are sprouting up, we are looking for reform, uncovering the rape culture in this country where victims are blamed and shamed.” Johnson is one of more than 50 women who have accused the comedian of sexual assault. However, the trial only focused on allegations brought forth by Andrea Constand, former director of operations for Temple University’s women’s basketball team. She says Cosby drugged and assaulted her at his home near Philadelphia in January 2004. One other accuser, Kelly Johnson, was allowed to testify during the trial as prosecutors sought to establish that Cosby had a pattern of assault.  Cosby pleaded not guilty to the charges. His attorneys have said throughout that their client is innocent of all accusations. Jurors failed to reach a verdict in the aggravated indecent assault case, and Judge Steven O’Neill declared a mistrial Saturday after they deliberated for more than 53 hours. ’Attitudes were changed’ In a statement to CNN, accuser P. J. Masten said she was ”very disappointed that the judge did not allow other victims to testify.” Masten was among the Cosby accusers who responded to CNN requests for reaction to the mistrial.  Referring to the comedian, Masten said she ”will not degrade myself to ever” utter his name again. ”This is my past and I have no room for yesterday. There comes a point when you realize that turning the page is the best feeling in the world.  I have moved forward.  I have an amazing life. I AM NOT A SURVIVOR!  I AM A THRIVER!” she said in a statement. Kristina Ruehli said she ”was particularly nauseated” with a statement Saturday from Cosby’s wife, Camille, criticizing prosecutors, the judge and media. A member of the actor’s press team read the scathing remarks after the mistrial. ”The vitriol in it to me was over the top considering that (more than 50) accusers came forward and Cosby was not found innocent. There will be a retrial. It’s a tragedy. He ruined lives,” she said. ”This is not the end. If we take the good that came out of this    laws and attitudes were changed.” A mistrial means Cosby was not found either guilty or not guilty. Prosecutors said Saturday they will seek a new trial, Ruehli said Cosby has ruined his life and his reputation as well as his wife’s. That’s ”abundantly clear in the vitriol in Camille’s statement. I just hope she turns that on Bill Cosby. That might be real justice.” Praise for Constand’s ’courage’ Heidi Thomas praised Constand’s ”courage and willingness to go back into the maelstrom of this crime.” ”I personally cannot thank Andrea Constand enough,” she said. She said she hopes the case is a wakeup call for women in assault cases, saying they need to get to a hospital immediately to ”get that DNA saved.” ”DNA doesn’t lie, doesn’t fade with time, and can’t be altered to anything other than what it is.” Thomas advises people to file a police report within the time allowed by a state’s statute of limitations and urged state governments to abolish such statutes for rape and sexual assault. ”With DNA now available, this practice is antiquated to say the very least,” she said.  ’Not over till it’s over’ Cindra Ladd, in a statement issued through her spokesman, said she takes ”comfort knowing that Bill Cosby’s life is now, and forever will be, a living hell.” ”Bill Cosby has already been exposed as a predator who hid behind his jovial mask for more than 50 years and no jury verdict will ever change that,” she said. ”Those of us who came forward to speak our collective truth about what he did to us owe a debt of gratitude to Andrea Constand for her leadership and courage in demanding justice.” Gloria Allred, an attorney who represents many of Cosby’s accusers, told reporters Saturday outside court in Norristown that it’s ”not over until it’s over.” ”I have seen it many times in cases all over the country, and sometimes a second jury will render a different outcome than the first jury.” Allred said she hopes the court will allow other ”prior bad act witnesses” to testify at the next trial. ”We can never underestimate the blinding power of celebrity, but justice will come.” She said she hopes more accusers can testify ”because that’s relevant on the issue of whether Mr. Cosby had a plan, a scheme, to drug and sexually assault women.” ”I think the jury will be better served if they can hear from the other accusers and then they can make that decision as to whether or not they would convict and whether an alleged victim was in the position to consent or was incapacitated by drugs.”"
I traveled to the middle of the desert to see ’The Door To Hell’ — Turkmenistan’s crater of fire,"’’ ’At the heart of Turkmenistan’s Karakum Desert sits a crater of fire the size of a football field that’s been perpetually burning now for almost fifty years.’ ’’ ’’ ’Read on for a photo essay covering my visit to the ‘Door To Hell’:’ ’These ships of the desert blindly followed the motorway, chewing their cud, and didn’t show great respect to passing traffic. We also saw camel carcasses lining this same motorway, so it appeared that, for drivers, the feeling was mutual.’ ’Gas prospecting gone wrong, however, is the accepted explanation  —   Soviet engineers in 1971 bit off more than they could chew, drilling and hitting a gigantic underground gas cavern which then collapsed, forming a sinkhole and sucking the entire drilling rig into it. But nobody knows for sure. The Soviets allegedly concealed the extent of the disaster, leaving no paper trail, not even an incident report. As for fatalities? The official line is that there were none. But how we ‘know’ this, I am unsure.’ ’You may be wondering why steps haven’t been taken to either harness the crater’s energy or just extinguish it entirely. It’s likely because people simply do not care. Turkmenistan has the fourth largest natural gas reserves on earth, so an investment here at such a volatile site would be high risk, low reward prospect. If extinguished, the gas wouldn’t stop, you’d have to find a way to cap every fissure within proximity of the site, which would be expensive and inefficient. And, without that investment, dousing it would be  ; burning the natural gas is preventing its toxic components from lingering and hinders the methane’s potential as a greenhouse gas.’ ’As for the name? There’s an alternative theory. As the only light and heat source at night, animals are naturally attracted to the crater. It’s been said that camel spiders, seduced by its warmth, will approach and plummet to their deaths like a scene out of an apocalyptic, arachnid remake of the movie ‘300’. The stuff of nightmares.’ ’I must say, it did strike me how blasé we all became to the obvious risks. The edges were nothing but dry mud, and you could see it crumbling under your feet, yet taking that photo just a tad closer remained almost a magnetic enticement. Falling in would truly be horrendous, a painful death by asphyxiation, slowly cooked by the flames as the sounds of those panicking above are drowned out by its roar. You’d be helpless. I asked, and apparently no tourist has fallen victim, but there was an urban myth of one local who wasn’t quite so lucky.’ ’ ’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’"

"Mark McKinnon: GOP Establishment ‘Soaked the Place in Kerosene, All Donald Trump Did Was Light a Match’","Veteran GOP strategist Mark McKinnon told Breitbart News Daily that the rise of Donald Trump in the 2016 election reflects the fact that for years, the Republican Party “has had no clear vision of the future. ” The GOP establishment, he said, “soaked the place in kerosene. All Donald Trump did was light a match. ” In this election, “the Republicans are just going to have to burn the house down and rebuild it. ”[McKinnon is the     producer, and   of the Showtime   The Circus, which chronicles the 2016 presidential race.  He spoke with SiriusXM host and Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon about a scene in the episode called “The Reckoning” showing a group of six GOP establishment figures gathered at a private dinner to lament the rise of Donald Trump and discuss what can be done to defeat him. McKinnon said this particular scene “has lit up the boards like no other scene we’ve done the whole season. ” “A couple of weeks ago we said, ‘Let’s go find the establishment  —   what’s left of the establishment.’ It turns out there are six guys who are left,” McKinnon joked. “Old white warhorses,” Bannon laughed. “It’s literally like a   room out of something like Tammany Hall. ” “It sounded like you were dropping into a mafia don mob boss meeting, right?” McKinnon joked. From the candid conversation among these six men, “a couple things were clear,” McKinnon said. “First of all, there really is no coherent establishment, and to the extent there is an establishment, they have no clue how to deal with Donald Trump. ” “You look at the scene, and it’s pretty much an ad for Donald Trump,” he said. “The Trump people see that and say, ‘Well, that’s exactly why we’re supporting Donald Trump. ’” Bannon remarked on how shocking it was that despite having access to the commentariat, the consultants, the K Street lobbyists, and the massive donor money that all comprise the establishment apparatus, these figures still had no cohesive plan to “counter a populist uprising. ” McKinnon agreed, “There was not a coherent notion at all about what to do. In fact, there were very divergent notions. ” He explained: A couple of them were saying, “We’re part of the RNC, and we’ll ultimately support the nominee. ” A couple of them were saying, “We’re making   PAC ads. ” And a couple of them even said, “Listen, if it’s Donald Trump, then we may have to look at supporting Hillary Clinton”  —   which was pretty shocking to see. So, yeah, there is absolutely no coherency about what to do about Donald Trump, and that’s why he’s doing so well. Bannon noted that the key populist issues involving trade agreements and immigration that have animated voters in this election cycle “were not even in the top hundred” on the establishment’s radar. “How did they miss it so badly?” Bannon asked. “These are not dumb people. They’re very smart people. How did they miss it so badly?” McKinnon recalled that one of the establishment figures in the scene admitted that Trump “had a better finger on the pulse of what the American voter wants” than any of the six of them in that room. “The one thing I’ve said from the very beginning of this election is that it’s very likely that the Republicans are just going to have to burn the house down and rebuild it,” McKinnon said. “And, you know, they soaked the place in kerosene. All Donald Trump did was light a match, and the place is going up in flames. ” He explained, “The Republican Party, not just for this election cycle, but for a long time, has had no clear vision of the future, and occasionally democracy rises up and takes a hold of the reins, and that’s what’s happening in this election. The voters are saying, ‘Listen, you guys don’t have a clue. So, we’re going to give you one. ’” Bannon commented on the Shakespearean quality of this election cycle: We have talked about earlier today the Ides of March and the killing of Caesar 2, 060 years ago. This race is almost Shakespearean in its presentation. You have the Bushes, you have the Clintons, you have almost like these King Lear types. You have Obama, you have the Pope, you have Trump, you have Ted Cruz. Even the side characters in the commentariat  —   it’s so fascinating  —   you know, the Black Lives Matter guys. We’re talking about the Black Panthers over the weekend on the weekend show. You know, Angela Davis is now being talked about   …     It’s brought in so much of modern political history. But have you ever seen a race like this that just has this cast of characters? And the stakes, you know: American sovereignty vs. the globalists this populist uprising vs. the limited government conservatives? Have you ever seen the issues and the personalities come together in really kind of a Shakespearean way? “The Shakespeare analogy is a terrific one, and I may steal that from you,” McKinnon said. “We’re trying to think of a name for the next show, I think we’ll find some Shakespeare analogy to throw up there. ” “We just got really lucky that we chose this election to do this show,” McKinnon said. “People are really fascinated by what’s happening because there is this huge drama. There is a sense that there is a real revolution going on. And, you know, Trump is a big part of that. Bernie Sanders is a big part of that. ” “We are seeing a complete upheaval, and people are fascinated to watch it and say, ‘What comes next? What’s going to come out of all of this chaos and uprising? ’’’ he added. The Circus, which Bannon called the new “  television” for political junkies, runs on Showtime Sunday nights at 8PM.

New Ferguson Video Adds Wrinkle to Michael Brown Case - The New York Times,"In the two and a half years since Michael Brown, a black    was shot and killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo. the explosive case has been parsed in intricate detail. Witnesses offered varying descriptions of the fatal encounter. Investigators examined bloodstain evidence on the street where Mr. Brown died. And the police released a security video from a nearby store that showed Mr. Brown pushing a worker and taking cigarillos minutes before the shooting. But a second, previously unreported video from that same convenience store included in a new documentary is raising new questions about what happened in the hours before the shooting on Aug. 9, 2014. The footage shows Mr. Brown entering the store, Ferguson Market and Liquor, shortly after 1 a. m. on the day he died. He approaches the counter, hands over an item that appears to be a small bag and takes a shopping sack filled with cigarillos. Mr. Brown is shown walking toward the door with the sack, then turning around and handing the cigarillos back across the counter before exiting. Jason Pollock, a documentary filmmaker who acquired the new tape, says the footage challenges the police narrative that Mr. Brown committed a   robbery when he returned to the store around noon that day. Instead, Mr. Pollock believes that the new video shows Mr. Brown giving a small bag of marijuana to store employees and receiving cigarillos in return as part of a negotiated deal. Mr. Pollock said Mr. Brown left the cigarillos behind the counter for safekeeping. “There was some type of exchange, for one thing, for another,” Lesley McSpadden, Mr. Brown’s mother, says in Mr. Pollock’s documentary, “Stranger Fruit,” which premiered Saturday at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex. and examines the shooting from the family’s perspective. But Jay Kanzler, a lawyer for the convenience store and its employees, strongly disputes that version of events, and said the new footage is unrelated to Mr. Brown’s later visit to the store. “There was no transaction,” Mr. Kanzler said. “There was no understanding. No agreement. Those folks didn’t sell him cigarillos for pot. The reason he gave it back is he was walking out the door with unpaid merchandise and they wanted it back. ” Regardless of what happened at the store in the   hours, the new security footage does not resolve   questions about Mr. Brown’s encounter with Officer Darren Wilson along a Ferguson street that day. Officer Wilson, who claimed that he feared for his life and had been assaulted by Mr. Brown, was cleared of criminal wrongdoing by a county grand jury and federal civil rights investigators. He resigned from the Police Department. Mr. Brown’s death and the sometimes violent protests that followed raised broad questions about how police officers treat black people, both in the St. Louis area and across the country, and many remain steadfast in their belief that Mr. Brown was murdered. Protesters were particularly offended by the Ferguson Police Department’s decision to release the video that showed Mr. Brown shoving the store clerk, perceiving it as part of an effort to defame and demonize the young man. Ms. McSpadden, who also spells her first name as Lezley, questioned why that tape was released publicly while her son’s earlier visit to the store had been kept quiet. “They destroyed Michael’s character with the tape, and they didn’t show us what actually happened,” said Mr. Pollock, who spent more than two years in Ferguson conducting research for his documentary, and who questions the decision to not charge Officer Wilson. “So this shows their intention to make him look bad. And shows suppression of evidence. ” The St. Louis County Police Department briefly mentioned Mr. Brown’s   visit to the store in a lengthy report on the case, which tipped Mr. Pollock off to the existence of an additional video. Sgt. Shawn McGuire, a spokesman for the county police, said in an email on Saturday that footage of the earlier encounter had not been released because it was not relevant to the investigation. He added later that he could not confirm the video’s authenticity. Spokesmen for the city of Ferguson and the St. Louis County prosecutor’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday. Mr. Brown’s parents have filed a federal lawsuit against Officer Wilson, the city of Ferguson and the former Ferguson police chief. A civil trial is scheduled to start next year."
NY Times: Trump’s Deportation Efforts ’Not So Unusual’,"President Donald Trump’s deportation of hundreds of criminal illegal immigrants during his first month in office is “no so unusual,” according to The New York Times. [In analysis by the New York Times, Trump’s deportation effort to prioritize the removal of criminal illegal immigrants by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency shows that the enforcement actions are “not unprecedented”:  Last week, United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials arrested more than 680 people in at least 12 states, shown below, stoking fears that the Trump administration is increasing the arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants. But a comparison of last week’s arrests and similar ones during the first four years of the Obama presidency show that the recent level of enforcement activity is not unprecedented. It is unclear, however, if the numbers are an actual increase in enforcement, because information on operations in only 12 states was disclosed. The New York Times analysis then described how Trump’s deportation efforts are on par with Obama’s, citing that the Obama administration “arrested an average of 675 immigrants a week in   ‘community arrests’. ” In Obama’s first term in office, the analysis notes that ICE agents arrested over 35, 000 illegal immigrants, more arrests than any year in the previous four years of former President George W. Bush: The weekly average of such arrests made by Immigration and Customs Enforcement fugitive teams under President Obama rose to 771 in 2011 and declined slightly to 719 the next year. Data after 2012 are not readily available, but in more recent years, the number of ICE apprehensions and removals decreased overall, especially after the Obama administration began to focus on convicted criminals. In Mr. Obama’s two terms in office, there were at least six known operations in which more than 500 people were arrested, according to an analysis by The New York Times. Opponents of Trump’s plans, though, told the New York Times that the difference between Obama’s deportation efforts and the current model, is that Trump uses a “broader definition” when referring to criminal illegal immigrants. The Obama administration was careful to say that only people who had very serious charges or were recent arrivals were priorities for enforcement, but now, everyone is a priority, Mr. Capps said. Under Obama, nearly 90 percent of the illegal immigrants deported by ICE were convicted criminals. Trump, on the other hand, takes into consideration illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes, misdemeanors and those who have simply crossed the border. Some 75 percent of the 680 illegal immigrants arrested by ICE last week were convicted of crimes. The raids also included those who had illegally   the U. S. and who had been ordered for removal.

Sweden Introduces Women Only Swimming To Accommodate ’New Arrival’ Muslims,"Christian Science Monitor reports:[As Muslims become a larger part of Swedish society, some municipal pools are offering   swimming to accommodate the new arrivals. But while well intended, the new policy is bumping up against Swedish ideals of equality. On the face of it, the decision to offer special women’s swimming hours at the Hyllie sports center, a municipal swimming pool in the southern Swedish city of Malmö, should not be contentious. Indeed, Malmö is not alone. According to a survey by the Swedish TV channel TV4, 13 of Sweden’s 100 largest municipalities have begun offering separate swimming hours for men and women. “Our facilities are used by 40 percent women and 60 percent men,” Johan Hermansson, the head of Malmö’s recreations department, told TV4. “Our ambition is for them to be used equally by girls and boys, men and women. ” But the trend is not just about achieving   visitor figures. For decades, Swedish city swimming pools have operated   pools, but by adding   hours, officials are hoping to accommodate the country’s growing Muslim population. And that is raising a much larger issue for Sweden. Should the native population adjust to immigrant groups’ different lifestyles by accommodating   swimming and the like, thus providing access to Muslim newcomers who would otherwise not feel comfortable in   conditions? Or does the implementation of such segregation, however well intended, ultimately undermine the country’s   traditions of gender equality. Many Swedes are no longer sure. “During the past several years, we’ve had several Muslim women come and swim,” says Stockholm resident Carolina Johansson, who has gone to women’  sessions at a local swimming pool for the past 20 years. “But   swimming doesn’t feel like a positive development. ” Read more at Christian Science Monitor,  Read about the challenges of migrant swimming in Sweden’s baths at Breitbart London"
Michele Norris: Make a America Great Again Is Trump’s Deeply Encoded Promise of ’White Prosperity’ - Breitbart,"Sunday on CBS’s “Face The Nation,” radio journalist and former host of the National Public Radio’s “All Things Considered,” Michele Norris said   Donald Trump’s campaign promise to “Make America Great Again,” is a “deeply encoded,” slogan meant as a  “promise of white prosperity above everything else. ”  Norris said, “In the phrase ‘Make America Great Again,’ there’s one word that if you are a person of color, that you sort of stumble over, and it’s the word ‘again.’ Because you’re talking about going back to a time that was not very comfortable for people of color. They did not have opportunities, they were relegated to the back of the line. ” “And this was a country that  —   to be honest  —   was built on the promise of white prosperity above everything else. And for a lot of people, when they hear that message, ‘Make America Great Again,’ deeply encoded in that message is a return to a time where white Americans can assume a certain amount of prosperity,” she added.

"Behind-the-Scenes of Team Trump’s Triumph, Hillary’s Concession","New York magazine’s Gabriel Sherman offers a    account of Donald Trump’s campaign team on election night, including the concession phone call the   received from Hillary Clinton. [From New York magazine:  Shortly after 3 p. m. on November 8, Donald Trump walked into the war room on the 14th floor of Trump Tower and received rousing cheers from his staff. While virtually the entire media Establishment was predicting Hillary Clinton was on track to win the election, Trump’s team remained “nervous but optimistic,” in the words of one adviser, that their man would pull off a historic victory. According to the adviser, Florida governor Rick Scott had assured Team Trump that the campaign would “squeak it out” in the Sunshine State. “This election is about winning one state,” Rudy Giuliani told me. “If you win Florida, the rest will fall into place. ” And it did. Shortly before 11 p. m. the Associated Press called Florida for Trump and the trajectory of the race fundamentally tilted in Trump’s direction. “Humility to Euphoria,” Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway texted me shortly after the state fell to Trump. “Our plan was to protect our core four: Iowa, Florida, North Carolina, and Ohio,” she later said. “When we protected the core four and saw the numbers in Wisconsin, we thought we could win. ” Despite Trumpworld’s confidence in the numbers, the candidate himself was anxious. Trump watched the returns from his Trump Tower penthouse. “He was humble to the very end,” Conway recalled. “He kept saying, ‘We didn’t get it done yet.’ Even when the New York Times had us projected at a 50 percent chance of winning, and then 70 percent, and then 90 percent, he said, ‘It’s not done yet. ’”   …     Trump’s advisers arrived at the Hilton and waited for Fox News to call the election. Around 2:30 a. m. Conway’s cell phone rang. It was Huma Abedin calling on behalf of her boss, Hillary Clinton. She was ready to concede. “Hi, Kellyanne, it’s Huma. Is Mr. Trump available?” Abedin said, according to Conway. Conway passed the phone. Conway recalled Trump’s end of the conversation: “He said, ‘You’re a smart, tough lady and you ran a great campaign. Thank you for calling. I respect you. ” Conway said they spoke for about a minute.

"Thanksgiving: Hillary Fans Encourage Nasty, Vindictive Family Dinners","Resentful liberals across the country are thankful that Thanksgiving is an opportunity to insult relatives who may have voted for   Donald Trump. [A slew of liberals in the news and entertainment world offer guides for   lefties on what to do when forced to break bread with their supposedly “racist,” “bigoted,” and “misogynistic” relatives.  Gothamist‘s Scott Heins, for instance, told his readers he loathed his dad’s “bigotry and misogyny” and claimed his   father voted Trump because he was excited by the candidate’s “white nationalism. ” Heins also seemed to consider Thanksgiving dinner as little else but drudgery that he was obligated to suffer. He proclaimed it his “progressive duty” to hector his family back home in rural Minnesota about how Hillary Clinton would have been better, and that Trump is a racist, and that liberal policies are the only thing that can save the country. He sounds considerate. Speaking of “considerate,” leftist comedienne Samantha Bee made a list of ways bedraggled liberals could get even with their bigoted Republican relatives on Thanksgiving. The TV host lamented that liberals are forced to share a Thanksgiving meal with voters who put a “  lunatic who may or may not be able to read” into the White House, but she has the cure for that disease. Among her suggestions, Bee insisted that when a Republican relative starts the meal with a prayer, liberal family members should “take a knee” in emulation of the   protests of NFL player Colin Kaepernick. If that doesn’t work, Hillary fans can try drug abuse. “Accelerate the peaceful effects of tryptophan by pairing your turkey with five Xanax,” she wrote. Then Bee apparently insisted that murdering a Republican relative is also an option: “Calmly and reasonably explain to your uncle why Donald Trump was the wrong choice for president while your uncle quietly bleeds to death on the floor, the carving knife protruding from his chest. ” For Mother Jones, leftist Kevin Drum also had a few pointers on how to talk to your “crazy   relatives. ” Drum decided that the best way to discuss politics with “your   aunts and uncles” is to actually sit down and watch Fox, listen to talk radio, and learn about what conservatives actually think! But, after making the suggestion, Drum admitted that such an effort would all be too hard for him, so he hoped someone else would “do the country a public service. ” Finally, Ron Reagan, Jr. warned an MSNBC audience that liberals should avoid going to relatives’ homes if those relatives live in a state with concealed carry. Apparently Reagan assumes that Trump supporters will simply shoot liberal relatives who voted for Hillary. But the one bit of advice that seemed o appear most often among the lists of the left’s suggestions for Thanksgiving was to just skip it and stay home safe in their liberal, big city enclaves. “Consider canceling your plans,” Yahoo News wrote.

Dems call for investigation after Comey firing," (CNN) Democratic senators sharply criticized President Donald Trump’s decision to fire FBI director James Comey on Tuesday, with some calling for a special prosecutor to investigate Russian meddling into the 2016 US election and any connection to Trump’s aides. ”Mr. President, with all due respect, you are making a big mistake,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters he told Trump when the President called him earlier. Schumer added that it’s time for a special prosecutor to lead an investigation and that ”this investigation must be run as far away as possible from this White House.” Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said Tuesday evening that he wanted the Senate panel to hear from Comey as part of its investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 elections and questions about potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.  ”I still want him to come and testify, even as former FBI director,” Warner said in an interview on CNN’s ”Erin Burnett OutFront.” Describing Trump’s move as ”outrageous,” Warner issued a call to public servants and legislators to stand against overreach he compared to the Nixon era. ”What happened during the Nixon period, there were people of principle who stood up against some of   (Richard) Nixon’s actions,” Warner said. ”I’m hoping in the coming days that we’ll see either out of the administration, and frankly from a lot of my colleagues, a willingness to rise above partisanship.” Other prominent Democrats across Washington cited Nixon’s behavior more than 40 years ago to describe Trump’s decision to sack Comey following the recommendation of the attorney general and deputy attorney general. ”This is Nixonian,” Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Bob Casey said in a statement. ”Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein must immediately appoint a special counsel to continue the   investigation.” Casey cited Comey’s testimony last week before Congress where he confirmed the Department of Justice’s investigation of Russian meddling included ”investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination.” ”We are careening ever closer to a Constitutional crisis, and this development only underscores why we must appoint a special prosecutor to fully investigate any dealings the Trump campaign or administration had with Russia,” said Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, in a statement. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called for ”an independent, bipartisan commission” following Comey’s firing. ”The President’s sudden and brazen firing of the FBI Director raises the ghosts of some of the worst Executive Branch abuses,” Pelosi said in a statement. ”We cannot stand by and watch a coverup of the possible collusion with a hostile foreign power to undermine American democracy.” RELATED: 10 things we learned from FBI Director James Comey’s Senate hearing, At last week’s hearing, Comey confirmed that the FBI’s investigation into possible coordination between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russian officials was continuing.

"Here’s the next hill Trump, Ryan and House Republicans could die on","’  ’ ’   The AHCA is dead, long live the AHCA. ’ ”   The healthcare bill’s swift death occured, in part, because House   Speaker Paul Ryan and the Trump administration are anxious to get   to some legislative policy where they can rack up a win  —     specifically, tax reform. ” ”   But it’s not going to be that easy, especially not without the   spending cuts the passage of the AHCA would’ve provided. ” ”   Republicans needed those cuts because they are trying to pass tax   reform through a mechanism called budget reconciliation. That   allows a measure to be passed by a simple majority  —   so no   Democracts can filibuster  —   as long as its revenue neutral   (doesn’t add to the deficit). ” ”   Now, without the AHCA cuts, it’s going to be harder to go with   the substantial tax cuts Trump and Ryan’s plan have proposed   without adding to the deficit, so that’s one hurdle. ” ’’ ’   Another is in the details of Ryan’’s ”Better Way” bill itself, and   they aren’’t small details. Ryan’’s plan fundamentally changes   America’’s tax system by significantly lowering the corporate tax   rate from 35% to 20% cutting out breaks for corporate America  —     like net interest deductions  —   and implementing a border   adjustment tax (BAT). ’ ”   The border adjustment tax would be a huge change for us. Most   simply, it’s a tax on imported goods and a tax break for exported   goods. The way supporters of the measure reason it, the tax   domestic importers have to pay will be offset by a strengthening   dollar. Plus, it will go a long way in raising revenue to make   this tax bill passable through reconciliation, so fiscal hawks   (like the intractable Freedom Caucus) like it. ” ”   But the measure is controversial, and here’s why. ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’The AHCA is dead, long live the AHCA.

Steven Van Zandt: ’Hamilton’ Cast Should Apologize to Mike Pence,"E Street Band guitarist Steven Van Zandt has called on the cast of the Broadway show Hamilton to apologize to Mike Pence for what he described as their “bullying” of the Vice   during a performance in New York City Friday night. [In a series of Twitter messages on Saturday, Van Zandt said the cast of the     play “made a mistake” and had set a “terrible precedent” for the theater when they addressed Pence directly from the stage toward the end of Friday night’s performance.  At the end of a show which saw Pence booed loudly at various points, actor Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays former vice president Aaron Burr, read aloud a message to the future vice president: “We, sir, are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights,” the actor said. The brief remarks were reportedly written by Hamilton creator   Miranda, director Thomas Kail and producer Jeffrey Seller. Tonight,   Mike Pence attended #HamiltonBway. After the show, @BrandonVDixon delivered the following statement on behalf of the show. pic. twitter.   —   Hamilton (@HamiltonMusical) November 19, 2016,  But on Twitter Saturday, Van Zandt  —   who says he could not “disagree more with everything Pence represents”  —   called the actors’ actions “completely inappropriate. ” “When artists perform the venue becomes your home. The audience are your guests,” he wrote. “It is nothing short of the same bullying tactic we rightly have criticized Trump for in the past. It’s taking unfair advantage of someone who thought they were a protected guest in your home. ” “You don’t single out an audience member and embarrass him from the stage,” the guitarist added. “A terrible precedent to set. ” In a tweet on Saturday,   Donald Trump similarly requested an apology from the show’s cast: “The Theater must always be a safe and special place,” Trump wrote. “The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!” The core cast of Hamilton, including Miranda, had been vocal supporters of Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. In October, Miranda and actress Renee Elise Goldsberry headline a “Broadway for Hillary” fundraiser in New York alongside comedian Billy Crystal. Clinton took in a performance of the hit show in July, just hours after she was grilled by federal investigators about her use of a private email server while she was Secretary of State. Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, later met with Miranda backstage. Read the rest of Van Zandt’s tweets below: Hamilton made a mistake.

NATO flexes military muscle near Russia," (CNN) NATO members flexed their military muscle in Russia’s backyard Monday, as allied warships headed toward the Black Sea while American tank fire echoed across Polish plains.   The naval force ”Standing Maritime Group 2,” which consists of eight vessels from eight NATO member states, is going to the Black Sea to participate in an exercise off the coast of Romania known as ”Sea Shield.” The Black Sea, like the Baltics, is becoming an increasingly contested space between Russia and NATO as Moscow has militarized Crimea, according to the alliance. ”This is a demonstration of the alliance’s resolve to defend all allies against any threat, and to enhance maritime security in the region,” said a NATO official. While ”Sea Shield” is not technically a NATO exercise according to officials, it will include a number of NATO countries, including Bulgaria, Canada, Greece, Romania, Spain, the USA and Turkey. American tanks and troops on Monday also took part in military drills in Zagan, Poland, sending a message to the Kremlin amid concerns that US President Donald Trump’s commitment to NATO allies and partners is wavering. Trump’s statements earlier this month that NATO is obsolete and that he wants to improve relations with a Russia that has been testing the borders of   War Europe have triggered alarm on the other side of the Atlantic. However, Trump’s newly confirmed defense secretary, retired Gen. James Mattis, a former supreme allied commander of NATO, has voiced unequivocal support for the alliance and said he had said as much to Trump. The US forces that participated in Monday’s joint drills were part of a   deployment earlier this month. The Pentagon has said these troop rotations to Europe are intended to bolster ties with NATO allies and send a clear message to Russia."
The great umbilical cord-cutting debate," (CNN) For the layperson, a few minutes might tick by without a second thought, but those precious minutes after a baby is born could be beneficial for newborns later in life, some doctors say. When to ”clamp” and or cut one of the most prominent fixtures associated with childbirth, the umbilical cord, has been at the center of an international   clash for decades.  What started as a   movement by UK midwife Amanda Burleigh nearly a decade ago, has recently grabbed the attention of medical doctors around the world.  ”I wanted to find answers to why so many children, including mine, my friends’ and my colleagues’ appeared to have additional learning and health needs, especially the boys,” said Burleigh. So she started reflecting on her own practice as a midwife.  ”I began to question why we were trained to cut the umbilical cord immediately after a baby was born,” said Burleigh. ”I then started to explore my theory that there must be a link to a child’s health based on when the cord is cut.” Her curiosity grew into a movement.  Doctors say before the   when many babies were delivered by midwives, most cord cutting happened when the umbilical cord stopped pulsating, around five minutes after birth. Despite a growing body of medical evidence, the exact time frame when the cord should be clamped continues to be a controversial topic among the medical community.  According to the American College of Obstetrician and Gynecologists, or ACOG, generally most umbilical cord clamping happens within 15 to 20 seconds after birth. The ACOG does not endorse the practice of delayed cord clamping but rather suggests cord clamping should take place between 30 to 60 seconds after birth, since the ideal timing for cord clamping has yet to be established.  Many international health organizations, including the World Health Organization, now recommend umbilical cord clamping be performed from one to three minutes after birth.  Medical studies have suggested positive effects of delayed cord clamping after birth, including increases in iron stores, blood volume and brain development. In a study released this week in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics, researchers in Sweden measured the effects of delayed cord clamping on children past infancy and up to four years, a time frame few doctors have examined.  In the study, a group of 263 healthy Swedish   babies were randomly split into two groups. One group had their umbilical cords clamped less than 10 seconds after birth. The cords of the other group were clamped three minutes after birth. The two groups were then monitored for four years. The babies with delayed cord clamping performed modestly better on tests assessing their fine motor skills and social skills. The boys in the study displayed the most statistical improvement. The results, researchers say, showed no difference in overall IQ.  Though the results are not dramatic, researchers involved with the study said this is an important step. ”It’s incredible to see what a difference an extra three minutes and   cup of blood can have on the overall health of a child, especially four years later,” said Dr. Ola Andersson, lead author of the study and a pediatrician at the department of women and children’s health at Uppsala University in Sweden. ”This is very promising, but larger studies are necessary,” said Andersson.  At birth an estimated   of the baby’s blood is in the placenta. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, a protein molecule, which carries oxygen to body tissues. At birth, the smallest amount of blood could have a big impact on specific aspects of an infant’s health, doctors in support of delayed cord clamping say.   Doctors in support of delayed cord clamping say there are also external drivers perpetuating the practice of early cord clamping in developed countries. Early cord clamping causes vital blood cells to remain in the placenta, which could be used and stored in stem cell banks, doctors say.  ”It’s not a black and white issue,” said Dr. David Hutchon, retired obstetrician from the Memorial Hospital in Darlington, United Kingdom. ”Though early cord clamping makes it easier to collect and bank cord blood stem cells    since most of the blood volume remains in the placenta    in turn, the nutrients from the cord blood are not directly delivered to the infant at birth.”  In the past 55 years, early cord clamping has become more popular as the medical protocol for managing the third stage of labor. This has largely been attributed to the need to monitor the cord blood gasses to test if a baby has been starved of oxygen during labor. Lack of oxygen during labor can cause brain damage in later years for some children, doctors say.  ”When it comes to labor management practices, we need to find a better way of testing for the cord blood gases as well as getting billions of stem cells out of the cord and placenta after the baby has had its physiological transition and a normal blood volume,” said Hutchon. ”We’re getting closer to finding a solution but we’re just not there yet.”  Neonatologist Anup Katheria, director of the Sharp Mary Birch Neonatal Research Institute in San Diego, aims to find alternative ways in which very premature infants who need help with breathing at birth can receive delayed cord clamping without having to be removed from their mother into a separate treatment area.  ”The practice of helping babies breathe while waiting to clamp the umbilical cord has been around for a long time it makes sense for the sickest infants,” said Katheria. ”We’re focused on producing evidence that shows the benefits. We think this could become the foundation for practice changing resuscitation techniques, transforming outcomes for the most critical of newborns nationwide.” Despite the obstacles, Amanda Burleigh said she will continue to champion for delayed cord clamping.  ”I’ve been told I’m like the midwifery version of Erin Brockovich, which is a huge compliment,” said Burleigh. ”The body of medical evidence is growing in support of stopping immediate cord clamping but there is still a lot of resistance because many people just don’t know about it and it’s always hard to change common practice.”"
Mika Brzezinski: Hillary Campaign Tried to Get Me ’Pulled Off the Air’ - Breitbart,"Friday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,”   Mika Brzezinski revealed a moment in this year’s presidential contest which the Clinton campaign had attempted to go over her head to NBC management for criticizing that campaign’s effort.  Brzezinski said when she had warned the campaign of being arrogant, the Clinton campaign acted as if she had done something “journalistically inappropriate” and “needed to be pull off the air. ” “Listen, when I was concerned the campaign was not understanding that perhaps there was an arrogance that they need to get off their high horse and understand that this wasn’t over,” Brzezinski said. “I’ll just say it  —   NBC got a call from the campaign, like I had done something that was journalistically inappropriate or something and needed to be pulled off the air. I mean, think about that. That’s just  —   shooting the wrong messenger. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"
Gun Ownership in LGBT Community Continues Surge Under Trump,"The surge in gun ownership among LGBT community members that began after the June 12, 2016, Orlando Pulse attack has continued and even grown during the first months of the presidency of Donald Trump. [Haaretz reports, “The latest   wave, following the June 2016 mass shooting at a gay bar in Orlando, Florida, has brought a new kind of person to the gun culture  —   young and liberal gay people, many of them  . They’re now standing side by side with straight white conservative men at shooting ranges. ”  The Orlando Pulse nightclub was a   zone and the attack on it was carried out by an Islamist with two guns a rifle and a handgun. He passed background checks for both guns and a   waiting period for the handgun, proving once more that gun control is no hindrance to determined attackers. Many in the LGBT community came away from the attack awakened to this fact and to the reality that they were going to have to take   into their own hands —  literally. Enter the Pink Pistols. Prior to the Orlando Pulse attack “the Pink Pistols Facebook group numbered about 1, 500 people. ” But following the attack “sixteen Pink Pistols branches opened  …     and the Facebook group grew to 9, 000 members. ” Pink Pistols spokesperson Gwendolyn Patton said: We teach queers to shoot so they can be safer from those who would harm them for who and what they are. Then we tell the world we’ve done it, so those who think queer people are helpless targets who can’t fight back and are easy pickings for violence will know that it isn’t necessarily true   …    . We don’t want to have to shoot anyone. We’d much rather they decided it wasn’t worth the risk and went to play pool or something. On June 12, 2016, just hours after the Orlando Pulse occurred, Breitbart News quoted Patton saying, “Let us not reach for the   fruit of blaming the killer’s guns. Let us stay focused on the fact that someone hated gay people so much they were ready to kill or injure so many. A human being did this. The human being’s tools are unimportant when compared to the bleakness of that person’s soul. ” Patton admitted that it is difficult to carry guns in the bars of some states because of   prohibitions. But she suggested this can often be remedied by a selecting designated driver who agrees to forgo any alcohol for the night so that that he can carry a gun with which to protect his companions. Patton said, “It’s sad that we must consider such things, but when there are persons out there who mean us harm, we must find ways to protect ourselves within the law. ” Erin Palette is transgender who lives 60 miles from Orlando and has concealed carry permit. Palette recalled how the LGBT community’s view of owning guns for   appeared to change overnight —  following Orlando Pulse —  and how gun ranges and firearms training facilities across the country were eager to help: I started seeing this wonderful outpouring of support from gun owners who were posting all across social media that if you were LGTBQ and wanted to learn how to defend yourself, these gun owners would teach you shooting for absolutely free. And the sentiment was: ‘I don’t care what your politics are, I don’t care what your sexuality is, I don’t care what you have between your legs  —   you are a human being, you have the inherent right to defend yourself, and if you don’t know how, I will be happy to teach you.’"

’This is serious’: Jared Kushner reportedly tried to set up a secret Trump-Russia backchannel,"’   ’ ”   Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s    and top White   House adviser, was willing to go extraordinary lengths to   establish a secret line of communication between the Trump   administration and Russian government officials, The Washington   Post  on Friday. ” ”   During the presidential transition period leading up to Trump’s   inauguration, Kushner held a series of meetings with the Russian   ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak, and the head of a Moscow   bank that was under US sanctions. ” ’   In talks with Kislyak in December, Kushner floated the   possibility of setting up a secure line of communication between   the Trump transition team and Russia  —   and having those talks   take place in Russian diplomatic facilities in the US, essentally   concealing their interactions from US government scrutiny,   The Post wrote, citing US intelligence officials briefed on the   matter. ’ ’   Kislyak reportedly passed along that request to Moscow. The   Post’’s Ellen Nakashima, Adam Entous, and Greg Miller   reported that the Russian ambassador was ”taken aback” by   Kushner’’s request, because it posed significant risks for both   the Trump team and the Kremlin.  ’ ”   Kushner, who did not disclose the meeting on his security   clearance form, is now a subject in the FBI’s investigation of   Russia’s election interference, and whether the Trump campaign   colluded with Moscow to undermine Hillary Clinton. ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Kushner did not previously disclose the December meetings to US   officials during his background check, and the White House only   acknowleged them after news outlets reported on it.

Sessions on Campaign Trail in FL: ‘Something Big Is Happening’ - ‘People Are Taking Their Country Back’ - Breitbart,"TAMPA  —   Wednesday at the Florida State Fairgrounds, Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) joined GOP nominee Donald Trump on the campaign trail to tout why Trump was the best presidential choice for Americans. [During his   introduction of Trump, Sessions declared Trump would implement immigration and economic policies that would best suit America’s national interest.  “Thank you for being part of a movement that’s going to put America on the right track again,” Sessions said to the Tampa crowd. “You know the American people are right. They are right consistently if you just listen to them. They want a lawful system of immigration that serves the national interest. What’s wrong with that? We’ve had politicians promise for 30 years they are going to fix this system and have never done it. And Donald Trump will build a wall and fix it. ” There is another issue and that’s jobs and wages,” he added. “If you bring in more workers than we have jobs for, don’t we reduce wages and make Americans unemployed? That’s one of the things that’s why wages have declined significantly. Also bad trade deals that close   manufacturing facilities. Doesn’t that eliminate good jobs and result in lower wages for the average American out there today? It absolutely does and Donald Trump understands both of those. He stood up for you. He stood up for America against the establishment to advocate for reform in both of those areas. The junior Alabama senator argued Trump’s opponent Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton lacked the will, the strength, the determination and the knowledge to “change” the country and get it back on the proper track. “We need a strong person with clear values who will stand and fight for us and Donald Trump that person in my opinion. Now friends, that’s kind of how i came to decide early on to support Donald Trump and I believe what I have seen of him in the last few days as we have traveled together and seen cold start moving significantly in his direction. ” Remarking on the size of the crowds Sessions said he has seen before Trump in the past few days on campaign stops, Sessions declared “something big” was happening and that the people were “taking their country back. ” “The big crowds that are occurring, like this one are happening all over the country,” he said. “Don’t tell me something isn’t something big is happening.

4 stats about the US economy that will make anyone worried,"’  ’ ’   Numbers can do lots of things. ’ ’   One thing numbers are good at is making you nervous about some   vague point in the future based on what some sets of statistics   have previously said about the futures that followed. ’ ’   Our concern today is with US gross domestic product and what   history says is most likely coming down the pike for the economy. ’ ’   Namely: recession. ’ ”   In a note to clients on Tuesday, analysts at 720 Global worked   through some of the big takeaways from Friday’s disappointing GDP   report, which showed that the US economy grew just 1. 2% in the   second quarter of 2016 and has now grown at an average of 1. 2%   over the past 12 months. ” ’’ ”   Based on data going back to 1948, there are several things   that in 720’s view should worry investors or at least encourage   them to keep their guard up. ” ’   In its report, 720 noted: ’ ’   Of course, we live in extraordinary times. ’ ’   The recovery out of the deepest recession since the Great   Depression has been disappointing.

Congressman Jim Jordan: All We’re Asking Is IRS Commissioner No Longer Holds His Job - Breitbart,"House Republicans staged an impeachment hearing Wednesday for IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, who is charged with High Crimes and Misdemeanors in his dealings with congressional investigations. [“The allegations of misconduct against Mr. Koskinen are serious,” said Rep. Robert Goodlatte (R. .) the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.  “On his watch, volumes of information crucial to the investigation into the IRS targeting scandal were destroyed,” he said. “Before the tapes were destroyed, congressional demands, including subpoenas, for information about the IRS targeting scandal went unanswered and were not complied with. ” IRS Commissioner John Koskinen arrived in the Rayburn House Office Building hearing room at or around 9:45 a. m. with a small coterie of aides and a big smile. Working the rows of GOP congressmen already settling in, Koskinen acted like a man running for class president rather than the target of an impeachment process that could end with his removal from office by Congress. In his opening statement, Koskinen said he regretted that he had been unable to bring the controversies surrounding the handling of tax status to a conclusion. The commissioner said he took the job with the intent of restoring confidence in the agency, but looking back, he acknowledged that he should have worked more closely with Congress. Addressing the matter of his impeachment, he felt it would slow the pace of reform at the IRS and would deter people from wanting to enter public service. Koskinen said that under his watch, the IRS has ended the BOLO, or Be On the lookout, alerts that were bringing special attention to specific groups. Going into the 2012 election cycle, the IRS issued a BOLO for organizations with names using words such as, Tea Party, conservative, liberty, constitution. and Israel. The targeting operation was directed by IRS official Lois Lerner, now retired. Lerner’s operation would harass conservative groups with exhaustive and inappropriate requests for correspondence, donor lists, social media posts. and other documents. Lerner’s chief tactic was to   a group’s paperwork, so that they were frozen without an approved tax status. Because there was no status, contributors were confused and the group itself did not have a decision to appeal. Former chairman of the committee Rep. Lamar Smith (R. ) made a short statement when his turn came up. Smith said he was stunned by the number of members of the Obama administration that have been in trouble for their handling of emails, their destruction of evidence, and their refusal to comply with subpoenas. Smith, the chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology committee is in the process of compelling the Commerce Department to obey his subpoena for documents. Cutting his own time short, Smith then tossed a lateral to Rep. Jim Jordan (R. ) yielding to him the balance of his time. This switch had been arranged Tuesday, when Smith approached Jordan and asked Jordan if he wanted some more time to question the commissioner.  Jordan tore into Koskinen. The Ohio congressman pressed the commissioner on how is it that his counsel discovered Feb. 2, 2014 that Lerner’s hard drives were destroyed and that her emails that were under subpoena could not be produced. But on March 4, 2014 IRS employees erased 422   tapes that would have captured the emails lost from Lerner’s hard drive. It was even stranger that the tapes were meant to be destroyed a year before but had survived, only to be erased a month after the IRS learned they were the only source of subpoenaed documents, he said. “We’re supposed to believe that this is a coincidence?” he asked. Koskinen said there was a thorough investigation that supported his previous testimony that although he gave the order to preserve documents requested by Congress, two midnight shift employees in New Martinsville, West Virginia did not get the word and on their own initiative erased the tapes. “Ah, the old midnight shift guys in New Martinsville excuse,” Jordan replied. Next, Jordan read from one of the supporting documents to the impeachment resolution an excerpt quoting Koskinen’s June 2, 2014 testimony that all emails and other requested documents had been preserved: “‘Nothing has been lost. Nothing has been destroyed,’ —  is that statement true Mr. Koskinen?” The commissioner told Jordan he thought it was true at the time. Then, Jordan twisted his body to face Goodlatte: “Mr. Chairman, this is the problem!” Jordan told Goodlatte that anyone in his own district back in Ohio who had behaved in such a way would be in trouble, “This is what so many Americans are frustrated about, this double standard,” he said. “All we are asking is that this guy no longer holds this office,” Jordan said. After his first round of questioning, Jordan told Breitbart News he took note of how Koskinen in both his testimony and written statement admitted to mistakes. “It is something he should have done a long time ago,” he said, adding: Think about every duty he had. He had a duty to preserve the record, they didn’t do that —  it was under preservation order and subpoena —  he had a duty to protect those documents, he failed to do that because they destroyed a bunch of them. He had a duty to disclose to us if he couldn’t preserve and produce those documents in a timely fashion —  he failed to do that he waited months before he told us they were missing. Koskinen needs to be held accountable, he said. “He had a duty to testify accurately and he had a duty to correct the record if he testified inaccurately —  he breached every duty he had,” he said. “Again, that’s why he has to go. ”"
Hillary Clinton: ‘I May Have Short Circuited’ on Email Answer,"Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said she may have “short circuited” during her response on her emails in an interview with Fox News reporter Chris Wallace. [“I may have short   it and for that I will try to clarify,” Clinton said in a response to NBC’s Kristen Welker after her speech at the National Association of Black Journalists conference.  She said that she and Chris Wallace were talking past each other, and that the answer may have gotten confused. From the transcript: WALLACE: After a long investigation, FBI Director James Comey said none of those things that you told the American public were true. CLINTON: Chris, that’s not what I heard Director Comey say, and I thank you for giving me the opportunity, in my view, clarify. Director Comey said my answers were truthful, and what I’ve said is consistent with what I have told the American people, that there were decisions discussed and made to classify retroactively certain of the emails. Clinton’s comments were given a “pants on fire” rating from Politifact and “four Pinnocchios” by the Washington Post. But Clinton said she was merely pointing out that FBI director said that Clinton’s answers to the F. B. I. about her email were truthful. “I do think having him say my answers to the FBI were truthful and then I should quickly add what I said was consistent with what I had said publicly and that’s really sort of in my view trying to tie both ends together,” she said. Welker pointed out that Comey actually said that Clinton sent three emails that were marked classified. Clinton tried to clarify that Comey referred to emails that were “resembling classified markers” but that the 100 emails she sent containing classified information were not marked classified, which is “pretty much what I have been saying throughout this whole year. ” She again apologized for not using two email accounts and said that she would “take responsibility” for that decision."
No Health Insurance Is Hard. No Phone? Unthinkable. - The New York Times,"SPRINGVILLE, Utah  —   As the health care debate thundered away in Washington, Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah stirred up a social media squall the other day by suggesting that uninsured Americans should invest in their own health care “rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love. ” Here in Mr. Chaffetz’s solidly Republican district, one of those uninsured Americans watched the viral CNN interview on  —   what else?  —   her cellphone. Not a new iPhone, though, but a Samsung with a cracked screen, one that Shari Hunter and her husband, Anthony, bought with their tax refunds two years ago. “An iPhone and insurance are not the same thing at all,” Ms. Hunter, 32, said. “If you need to be able to decide between an iPhone and health insurance, you need to look at: Why is that the choice?” To Mr. Chaffetz’s supporters, his comments sounded like a   defense of individual responsibility in the midst of a knockdown debate over the government’s role in providing health care to Americans. To his critics, they sounded like a callous and obtuse dismissal of the hard choices that struggling families face every day  —   and one that echoed earlier, racially noxious arguments over “welfare queens” and criticisms of programs that helped provide phone service to poor people. The Hunters have thought plenty about trying to cut out the $100 they spend on cellphone service every month. Yes, they said, it’s a lot, especially when they don’t have health insurance and they stretch the last dollars from their $1, 800 monthly income to buy diapers and gasoline. But the cellphone tethers the couple together when Mr. Hunter leaves for his nearly $   job at a call center and Ms. Hunter stays home with their three children  —   9, 4 and 3 years old  —   here in the Utah Valley. They chat on his   breaks. It pains Mr. Hunter to be away from the children, so Ms. Hunter texts him photos of them making a snowman or playing on the backyard swing set. He sends her inspirational quotes from elders in the Mormon Church, to which they are both devoted. The Hunters said they voted for Mr. Chaffetz in November, but Mr. Hunter said his comment sounded like something a “  person” would say  —   not a parent receiving food stamps, whose children are covered by Medicaid and who usually has $86 left over after paying the month’s mortgage and other bills. Here in the heavily Mormon cities that run along the   Wasatch Range, several of Mr. Chaffetz’s uninsured constituents said that, of course, they would love to be rid of the cellphone bills that cost their families $30, $50, $100 every month. But they said the savings would hardly be enough to afford monthly health plans for their families. And how would they get by without their phones? “A cellphone is a lifeline,” said Myla Dutton, executive director of Community Action Provo, a food bank and   nonprofit. Jose Valdivia, 61, said he wouldn’t be able to quickly look up the latest engine modifications when he was repairing   vehicles at the mechanic’s shop where he works. His wife said they wouldn’t be able to send photos to relatives in Mexico City. The couple spoke as they waited for an appointment at a free health clinic run by volunteer nurses and doctors two nights a week in Provo. Not surprisingly, smartphones abounded in the waiting room. People texted about dinner, called relatives with updates, held their children’s attention with a game. Without her phone, Joana Delacruz, 45, said, she wouldn’t be able to see job postings from nursing employers, or check whether she should bring home some food for her    son after finishing her   p. m. shifts managing a McDonald’s in Provo. Ms. Delacruz said she had not had health insurance since she lost her job as a nursing assistant after she fell over a wheelchair last July and hurt her back. Workers’ compensation took care of the medical bills. But despite physical therapy and cortisone shots, her back still hurt, and she did not want to aggravate it by returning to a job that required lifting and moving patients. She earns about $1, 300 a month and has little left after paying $750 in rent (her son sometimes helps out) a $400 car payment and the $50 cellphone bill. The phone keeps her connected with her mother in Mexico. Her son texts her to remind her to get quarters for their building’s laundry machines. She scans job postings that arrive in her inbox. “There’s no other way,” she said. “It’s for work. It’s for relationships, it’s for my kids, it’s for my friends, everything. Life is hard to be by yourself. ” At home in Springville, the Hunters’ phones buzzed at 7 a. m. on Friday with text messages of support. It was a big day: Mr. Hunter had been taking computer classes after work at the call center, and Friday was the day he would take a test for his A+ certification, the first step toward what the family hoped would be a   job working on computer systems. The texts were from the Hunters’ “allies”  —   wealthier families who volunteer to provide social support to   families in the area. “Good luck, Anthony,” the messages read. “We’re thinking of you. You got this. ” “We’re praying for you. ” “Did you text them back?” Ms. Hunter asked her husband as he fried two eggs from their backyard henhouse. The couple said they had searched online but had been unable to find an affordable plan under the Affordable Care Act, and had paid tax penalties for not having insurance. They are both healthy, though when Mr. Hunter’s   back pain flares up, he deals with it by lying on the floor, strapping on a back brace or getting a massage from his wife. They consider themselves conservative and think that health care should not be a federally mandated purchase, but should be left to individual states. If they lived one state over in Colorado, which expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, they might have qualified for it. Utah approved a small Medicaid expansion, but the Hunters said it did not cover them. On her cellphone, Ms. Hunter said, she frequently checks her family’s bank account balances, updates her husband about filing their tax returns and sends notes of encouragement when he is gone. “He needs to know we believe in him,” Ms. Hunter said. “That’s the biggest thing. ” At 2:41 p. m. on Friday, two loaves of bread were baking in the oven, the two youngest children were playing in the living room, and Ms. Hunter was starting to chop potatoes for dinner when her phone chirped with news from her husband’s test. It had not gone well. “Do you know how far off you were?” she texted. “Yeah,” he replied. “Enough. ” Mr. Hunter said he would get gas and head home. Retaking the test could cost more than $100, but they would talk about their next steps when he got home. “We’ll have to wait,” Ms. Hunter said, phone in hand. “It looks like he probably doesn’t want to text. ”"
Kellogg to Cut 250 from American Workforce - Breitbart,"As a long list of companies announce new initiatives to add jobs and enlarge investment in the U. S. economy in the coming age of Trump, Kellogg Co. is announcing that it intends to cut another 250 jobs in America. [The famed breakfast cereal company has confirmed recent reports that it intends to scale back its workforce, according to USA Today.  The move is intended to make the company more efficient and is to be “focused on eliminating work that doesn’t drive the highest returns. ” Kellogg was still trading on Wednesday near its   low, closing at $71. 98, which was five cents below its Tuesday closing. “The majority of the impacted employees work at our headquarters in Battle Creek, and changes are taking place across most functions in the organization,” the company told the media. “As you would expect from Kellogg, we’ll help our impacted people through these transitions, including offering severance benefits and outplacement services. ” Kellogg has manufacturing plants across the country as well as in 17 other countries. But the company’s profits have been slipping for several years, now, resulting in a cutting of several thousand jobs since 2014. Last November the company announced it was cutting up to seven percent in its international workforce, and that was even after the company cut jobs at its Tennessee Eggo plant in June. And in 2014 Kellogg closed down a plant in London, Ontario, Canada with a loss of about 500 jobs. The announcement of yet another round of job cuts comes after the company decided to cut its advertising with Breitbart News at the end of 2016, thereby snubbing Breitbart’s 45, 000, 000 readers. In November, Kellogg noted that Breitbart News’s conservative readers are not “aligned with our values as a company. ” While the decision by Kellogg to cease advertising made virtually no revenue impact on Breitbart. com. it did represent an escalation in the war by leftist companies like Target and Allstate against conservative customers whose values propelled Donald Trump into the White House.

Day 2 of GOP convention speeches: CNN vets the claims," (CNN) The Republican Party gathered in Cleveland  on Tuesday for the second night of its convention, and CNN’s Reality Check Team put the speakers’ statements and assertions to the test. The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the speeches and selected key statements, rating them true mostly true true, but misleading false or it’s complicated. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Reality Check: Christie on Clinton and China, By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney, Christie attacked Clinton on multiple points, including the accusation that Hillary Clinton wanted the Chinese to purchase U. S. debt to help the Obama administration. ”In China, Hillary Clinton praised the Chinese government for buying our debt to finance Barack Obama’s bloated stimulus plan,” he said. In February 2009, soon after being named secretary of state, Clinton traveled to China and urged Beijing to keep buying U. S. debt, according to media reports at the time. In an interview on Chinese television quoted by Reuters, Clinton said that China made a ”wise” choice by buying United States debt instruments. Based on these reports, we rate Christie’s statement as true. Reality Check: Christie on Clinton and ’bring back our girls’ By Ryan Browne, CNN, Christie also hammered Clinton with a series of charges about her failures while serving as secretary of state. He was particularly critical over Clinton’s handling of the Boko Haram terrorist group in Nigeria. ”In Nigeria, Hillary Clinton amazingly fought for two years to keep an al Qaeda affiliate off the terrorist watch list,” Christie said. Boko Haram, an affiliate of al Qaeda, was never designated a foreign terrorist organization during Clinton’s leadership of the State Department. The department eventually labeled the group a terrorist organization while under Kerry in December 2013. According to a report obtained by Reuters,   Department official Lisa Monaco had lobbied Clinton’s State Department to designate the group a terrorist organization in 2012. The Daily Beast also reported on the State Department’s hesitancy during Clinton’s tenure to designate the group a terrorist organization, noting that a group of bipartisan members of Congress had also lobbied the department to put the group on the list, with some members saying that the designation would allow U. S. law enforcement personnel to work more closely with governments in the region. The kidnapping of the 200 Nigerian school girls occurred in April 2014. While Clinton was head of the State Department at the time, Christie says she ”fought” to keep them off the list and there is no evidence that she herself was personally responsible for the delay in the designation. Our verdict: false. Christie went on to add: ”Because of this reckless action by the candidate who is the   champion of women all around the world. These al Qaeda terrorists abducted hundreds of innocent young women two years ago. These school girls are still missing today. And what was the solution from the   team? A hashtag campaign.” While Clinton did tweet out the hashtag ”bring back our girls” in the wake of the kidnapping, she was no longer in office when the kidnapping occurred. It’s impossible to know whether a U. S. terror designation would have made any difference in the girls’ kidnapping. President Barack Obama did authorize the deployment of 80 U. S. troops to neighboring Chad about a month after the event in an effort to aid in their search. Therefore we rate the claim that the ”solution from the   team” was a ”hashtag campaign” as false. Reality Check: Christie calls Clinton ’chief engineer’ of Gadhafi’s overthrow, By Eve Bower, CNN, Christie assumed the role of prosecutor on the RNC stage, arguing that Clinton’s policy in Libya made her ”guilty” of ”ruining Libya” and ”creating a nest for terrorist activity by ISIS.” He labeled her the ”chief engineer” of the overthrow of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, saying Clinton’s ”grand strategy” in Libya was to blame for the North African state’s current calamity. In early 2011, as protests spread like wildfire from Tunisia to Egypt and then Libya, the world watched for weeks as Libyan security forces used increasingly brutal methods to suppress the uprisings. By   there seemed to be a coalition of European powers emerging in support of implementing a   zone over Libya. The approach would decisively change the course of events in Libya, and   President Nicolas Sarkozy seemed eager to take the lead. In the U. S. Obama had been elected, in part, on the basis of his opposition to the U. S. war in Iraq, and he was deeply reluctant to engage in   overseas military conflict. But Sarkozy saw himself in a different situation altogether: having campaigned on his desire to enhance France’s position in the Arab world, Sarkozy promised France ”would be side by side with the oppressed.” When the uprising in Libya began, Sarkozy saw an opportunity to make his mark. Though Clinton would ultimately be described as one of the most hawkish voices on Libya in the Obama administration, senior U. S.  officials say that Clinton was initially skeptical of U. S. involvement in this international coalition. Obama at first tried a less interventionist approach, signing an executive order freezing Gadhafi’s assets, and then backing a UN Security Council resolution to impose sanctions. Days later, France and Britain pushed the UN Security Council for a quick resolution that would authorize a   zone, but Clinton, still reluctant, chose instead to work with Susan Rice, the U. S. ambassador to the United Nations, to buy time in which to build broader international support for the move. But by   as intelligence warned of an imminent humanitarian crisis if government forces took on   Benghazi, aides say Clinton shifted and became convinced that an immediate   zone was necessary. The Security Council resolution passed March 17. Yet even after it was decided that a coalition of NATO members would enforce the resolution, France remained eager to take the lead. On March 19, hours before the air campaign’s official start, French jets attacked Libyan government tanks on their way to Benghazi. Where the Obama administration had been reluctant to be seen as jumping into another war, Republicans at the time used the administration’s own words against it, describing the U. S. role, with some sarcasm, as ”leading from behind.” In the first weeks after Gadhafi’s fall, when Libya’s   future seemed more hopeful, sources in the administration were eager to credit Secretary Clinton for her work helping to build an international coalition    and Clinton was happy to take it. ”Our response,” Clinton has said, was ”smart power at its best.” But because Clinton was neither the first to call for military intervention, nor the only one to plan the administration’s handling of the aftermath, we rate Christie’s claim false. Donald Trump Jr. Reality Check: Donald Trump Jr. on his father’s campaign funding, By Juana Summers and Sonam Vashi, CNN, Donald Trump Jr. said his father would be ”a President not beholden to special interests, foreign and domestic and one who funded his entire primary run out of his own pocket just to prove it.” It’s a claim we’ve heard again and again. Although Trump has sunk a significant amount of his own money into his campaign, CNN has found that he received about $14 million in campaign contributions from 8, 200 individual donors through the end of April. Trump has loaned his campaign 76% of the the $57. 7 million that the campaign has received through the end of April, according to the Federal Election Commission. While he’s funded a vast majority of his campaign, he’s also taken millions from outside donors    not just funding entirely out of his own pocket. His son’s claim is false. Reality Check: Donald Trump Jr. on Clinton ’destroying’ Medicare, By Amy Gallagher, CNN, The younger Donald Trump compared his father’s proposals to those of Clinton’s.  ”We’re going to elect a President . .. who will repeal and replace Obamacare without leaving our most vulnerable citizens without health care,” Trump Jr. said, ”and who will do it without destroying Medicare for seniors as Hillary Clinton has proposed.” But did Clinton really propose to end Medicare? Earlier this month, Clinton tweaked her previous stance on health care as a nod to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Her most recent position proposes expanding Medicare as an option to adults as young as 50. This expansion is why some conservative pundits have suggested that Clinton could destroy Medicare, since it invites more people into an already overloaded system.  ”Medicare is stretched so thin to meet the needs of today’s seniors that expanding enrollment is like inviting the neighborhood for dinner when you don’t have enough to feed your own kids,” wrote Fox News commentator Betsy McCaughey in the online news outlet Newsmax.               So is expanding Medicare likely to destroy it? Medicare does have serious solvency problems, and is currently set to run out of funds by 2028. Therefore, it would seem likely that any expansion of the program would exacerbate those problems and shorten the life of the program. However, as a historically popular program, it is unlikely that Medicare will be allowed to go bankrupt.  Despite being criticized by the likes of former President Ronald Reagan, the program has continued to expand since its creation    under both Democrats and Republicans. In fact, even several   conservatives have expanded it    including Reagan, former President Richard Nixon and George W. Bush.  It seems likely that the next president, whoever it may be, would look for ways to shore up Medicare, rather than let it die.  Therefore, we rate Donald Trump Jr. ’s claim that Clinton has proposed destroying Medicare false, however you read the phrase    Clinton has not proposed to destroy Medicare, but to expand it. While an expansion might strain the system, it is unlikely the system would be allowed to collapse. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, Reality Check: Carson on Saul Alinsky, Lucifer and Clinton role model, By Julie Block, CNN, Carson claimed that one of Clinton’s ”mentors was Saul Alinsky . .. someone that she greatly admired and that affected all of her philosophies subsequently.” He also said Clinton wrote her college thesis on Alinsky’s writings, and that the dedication page for Alinsky’s book, entitled, ”Rules for Radicals,” acknowledges Lucifer. Alinksy was a community activist, regarded as a radical in the   century for his teachings about people’s empowerment. Clinton did write her college thesis on Alinsky’s life, writings and political views, though much of her thesis was analytical. The conclusion of the thesis reads: ”In the first chapter it was pointed out that Alinsky is regarded by many as the proponent of a dangerous   philosophy. As such, he has been feared    just as Eugene Debs or Walt Whitman or Martin Luther King has been feared, because each embraced the most radical of political faiths    democracy.” This comparison to Debs, Whitman and King, along with Clinton’s continued exchange of letters with Alinsky well into her law school years, suggests that Clinton had a deep respect for Alinsky. Indeed, Alinsky personally acknowledged Lucifer in his book, published in 1971. He wrote, ”Lest we forget at least an    acknowledgment to the very first radical: from all our legends, mythology and history (and who is to know where mythology leaves off and history begins    or which is which) the first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom.” Additionally, a Washington Post piece written in 2007 suggests Alinsky had great influence over Clinton’s political ideology, causing her to switch from a Republican to a Democrat. The article reads, ”Arriving at Wellesley, she became president of the Young Republicans, but she soon drifted left. She said that 1968, the year she met Alinsky in Chicago, was a watershed in her ’personal and political evolution,’ marked by the escalation of the Vietnam War and the killings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.” The paper also noted, however, that Clinton wrote in her 2003 memoir, ”Living History,” that Clinton and Alinsky had a ”fundamental disagreement” about how to change the system.  Because of this, it is a stretch for Carson to say that Alinsky affected ”all of her philosophies subsequently.” Verdict: Mostly true. RNC   Sharon Day, Reality Check: Day on Clinton Foundation money, By Sonam Vashi, CNN, ”As head of a foundation, you accepted tens of millions of dollars from foreign countries who enslave women and who treat them as   citizens,” Day said, referring to Clinton. The Clinton Foundation has accepted millions from foreign governments, according to its website, which lists cumulative amounts. Saudi Arabia, Australia and Norway each gave the Foundation between $10 million and $25 million the Netherlands and Kuwait gave between $5 million and $10 million and Qatar, Brunei, Oman and the United Arab Emirates gave between $1 million and $5 million. Given that slavery is illegal in all countries but   slavery exists in many countries to varying degrees, we’re going to look at the women’s rights records of these top donor countries instead. (Note: for these indices, a rank with a smaller number generally denotes better treatment of women in that country.) According to 2014 data from the United Nations’ Gender Inequality Index, Qatar ranks 116th out of 155 countries for gender inequality. Kuwait (79th) Saudi Arabia (56th) Oman (53rd) and the United Arab Emirates (47th) all rank in a   range, while the Netherlands (7th) Norway (9th) and Australia (19th) all ranking in a   range, treat women more equally. For context, the United States is ranked 55th in this index. (Brunei was not included in the overall ranking for this index). To compare with another index: The World Economic Forum’s 2015 Global Gender Gap Report shows that Oman ranks poorly (135th out of 145 countries) as does Saudi Arabia (134th) Qatar (122nd) the United Arab Emirates (119th) and Kuwait (117th). Brunei was ranked 88th, Australia was ranked 36th, and Norway and the Netherlands were both in the top 15. The United States was ranked 28th. Given that at least some of the countries who donated millions to the Clinton Foundation have poor records in regards to women’s rights, we rate Day’s claim as true. NRA official Chris Cox, Reality Check: Clinton and the Second Amendment, By Chip Grabow, CNN, Gun rights was the focus Tuesday night in a speech by Cox, the executive director of the National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action. He targeted Clinton’s stance on guns and the Second Amendment, which reads in part that ”the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” Cox claimed Clinton wants to take away that right. Cox referenced a 2008 Supreme Court ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller, which struck down Washington, D. C.’s ban on handguns, which the court said violated the Second Amendment. The court said it violated the Second Amendment. Cox said Clinton disagreed with the decision: ”She said, ’The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.’ Think about that. All the Supreme Court said was that you have the right to protect your life in your own home but Hillary says they’re wrong.” But Cox went further, saying that ”a Hillary Clinton Supreme Court means your right to own a firearm is gone.” That echoes claims made by Trump that Clinton would abolish the Second Amendment if elected president. In a leaked recording of a private fundraiser last year, Clinton was heard saying, ”The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment,” referring to that 2008 ruling.  But in a statement earlier this year, apparently clarifying Clinton’s comments about that decision, a policy adviser to Clinton told Bloomberg Politics: ”Clinton believes Heller was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe, like safe storage laws to prevent toddlers from accessing guns.” The statement went on to say, ”In overturning Washington, D. C.’s safe storage law, Clinton worries that Heller may open the door to overturning thoughtful, common sense safety measures in the future.” Clinton has also been    about her views of the Second Amendment. She told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that ”I believe we can have common sense gun safety measures consistent with the Second Amendment, and, in fact, what I have proposed is supported by 90% of the American people and more than 75% of responsible gun owners. So, is Cox correct in his claim that Clinton would abolish the Second Amendment? As CNN reported in May: ”Clinton . .. has called for universal background checks and stricter controls on firearms, but has never called for the abolition of the Second Amendment. In fact, on her website, she calls gun ownership ”part of the fabric of many   communities.” Verdict: False. Donald Trump, Reality Check: Trump on winning by the most votes in history, By Sonam Vashi, CNN, Trump appeared at the convention by satellite to accept his official nomination. ”Together, we’ve achieved historic results with the largest vote total in the history of the Republican Party,” he said. Former President George W. Bush held the previous record in 2000, with 10. 8 million votes. CNN estimates that Trump holds almost 14 million raw votes. That’s after   turnouts this year during the primary season. However, Trump also holds a record for the number of people that voted for other Republican candidates. CNN estimates 15. 7 million people voted for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Ohio Gov. John Kasich or another Republican candidate    which means more people voted against Trump in the primaries than for him. The previous record for ”most votes against” in a Republican primary was held by Arizona Sen. John McCain. So, while Trump does have the largest raw vote total in a Republican primary, we rate his claim true, but misleading, since that number clearly doesn’t reflect unified Republican support for his candidacy. House Speaker Paul Ryan, Reality Check: Ryan on poverty, By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney, Obama and progressives such as him have let down the poor in America, according to Ryan. ”Under the most liberal President we have had so far, poverty in America is worse, especially for our fellow citizens who are promised better and who need it most,” Ryan said. It’s true that the poverty rate has increased during Obama’s presidency. It rose from 13. 2% in 2008, just before Obama took office, to a high of 15. 1% in 2010, in the wake of the Great Recession. As the economy has improved, the share of Americans in poverty has drifted down to 14. 8% as of 2014, the most recent year for which federal statistics are available.   Michael Mukasey, Reality Check: Mukasey on Clinton emails, By Eve Bower, CNN, Citing Clinton’s use of a private email server while leading the State Department, Mukasey used his platform at the convention Tuesday to argue that Clinton had ”violated” her oath to uphold the Constitution. Mukasey did not cite which part of the Constitution he feels she breached. But following extensive investigations by the FBI, the Justice Department and the State Department’s Inspector General, no government entity has found basis for pressing charges against Hillary Clinton. Nonetheless, let’s break Mukasey’s claims down one by one. Mukasey said, ”We now know that she chose to use her private email overseas.” This is true. Earlier this month, when FBI Director James Comey spoke about the findings of his department’s investigation into Clinton’s emails, he said Clinton ”used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, including sending and receiving   emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries.” Based on this, Comey said, ”It is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal email account.” But Comey concluded that ”no reasonable prosecutor” would bring a case on this basis. Mukasey also spoke of Clinton’s email server, arguing that it ”was so remarkably primitive the FBI could not figure out whether or not it had been hacked,” and, ”we do know that the emails of people she communicated with were hacked.” It is true that the FBI believes that ”hostile actors” gained access to the email accounts of people with whom Clinton was in ”regular contact.” But it is not clear that a more advanced server could have thwarted a sophisticated hacker, and indeed, the most sophisticated attacks rarely leave evidence of their presence. Mukasey argued that Clinton had ”sent and received secret, and top secret, and beyond top secret information and emails on an unsecure private email system instead of on the secure government system. And she did it without authorization.” The State Department had initially said that none of the information on Clinton’s server was classified at the time it was sent or received, but some of it was given restricted classifications afterward. But Comey’s investigation found that a small number of the emails were marked classified at the time they were sent or received. Of the 30, 490 emails Clinton gave investigators, Comey said, three emails were in this category. Clinton has also maintained that she had permission to use personal email. But a report by the State Department’s Inspector General ”found no evidence that the secretary requested or obtained guidance or approval to conduct official business via a personal email account on her private server.” The relevant laws that are in place to preserve transparency in government records were not enacted until 2014, after Clinton left office. And neither the FBI nor the Justice Department found that a criminal case was warranted. But Clinton’s former colleagues at the State Department did find that she was in violation of ”government policy.” Mukasey made three accusations that have been hotly debated for more than one year. Based on the findings of the investigations that have come out of this controversy, we rate Mukasey’s claims as true. Editor’s note: An earlier version of this Reality Check misstated the number of emails that were marked ”classified” at the time they were sent or received. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Reality Check: McCarthy on fairer taxes, By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney, McCarthy ticked off the ways the Republican agenda would help the nation. Among them, he said, ”our taxes will be fairer.” The Republican Party platform calls for establishing a   tax code, calling it a ”moral imperative.” ”Getting our tax system right will be the most important factor in driving the entire economy back to prosperity,” it reads. For Republicans, tax reform usually means cutting rates for the wealthy in order to stimulate economic growth, which will then trickle down to benefit all Americans. That’s what Trump wants to do. His tax plan would give the wealthy far bigger breaks than the middle class or working Americans. His proposal calls for reducing the current seven tax brackets to four and cutting the top rate on the wealthy to 25% from 39. 6%. It would also eliminate the estate tax, which affects only the very wealthy, and the Alternative Minimum Tax, which ensnares many affluent families. Bottom line for taxpayers:   Americans would see a federal tax cut of $2, 700, or 4. 9% of their   income, on average, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis. The top 1% would see a whopping $275, 250 reduction in their federal tax bill, or 17. 5% of their   income. Whether you consider this fairer depends on your place on the economic ladder. If you are wealthy, you may consider this fairer, but if you aren’t, you may wonder why the rich are getting such a big break. Verdict: It’s complicated. West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, Reality Check: Capito on Clinton and coal miners’ jobs, By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney  Capito ripped into Obama and Clinton for supporting policies that have hurt coal mining, a key industry in her state. ”His recklessness has cost more than 60, 000 coal workers their jobs since 2011,” Capito said of Obama. ”Not to be outdone, Hillary Clinton has already promised ’to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business. ’” There’s no question that coal mining is on the decline, but it’s been on a steady downward slope long before Obama took office. Government regulations and the rise of cleaner natural gas as a popular energy source have hurt the coal industry. Four big coal mining companies have filed for bankruptcy in the past two years. That said, Obama has not been a great friend of the coal industry, favoring instead clean energy. He’s also made addressing climate change a priority. Earlier this year, the Interior Department instituted a pause on issuing new coal leases on public lands while it reviews the federal coal program. Coal miners have lost jobs, though not as many as Capito cited. According to the Mine Safety  Health Administration, a government agency that’s part of the Department of Labor, there were 127, 977 individuals (employees and contractors) working in coal mining in the first quarter of 2011.  In the first quarter of 2016, that number has fallen to 78, 359. That’s a decline of 49, 618 jobs. To give some perspective, back in 1986, there were more than 185, 167 people working in coal mines. So on the number of coal workers who’ve lost their jobs, we rate Capito’s claim false. Clinton, however, did actually say at a CNN town hall in March that as President, she’d put a lot of coal miners and companies out of business. She later called it a misstatement, saying she meant that coal miners would continue losing jobs the way things were going. Clinton has proposed ”revitalizing” coal country with $30 billion in investment aimed at retraining former coal miners, protecting health and pension benefits for mineworkers and attracting investment to counties impacted with layoffs. She has also pledged to invest federal funds in clean coal technology. So it’s true that Clinton said she’d put coal miners out of work. EDITOR’S NOTE: This Reality Check has been updated as the Bureau of Labor Statistics figures previously used did not include contractors. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Reality Check: McConnell on Clinton and Keystone positions, By Chip Grabow, CNN, McConnell said, ”Hillary has changed her positions so many times, it’s impossible to tell where the conviction ends and the ambition begins.” He cited various policy examples, including the Keystone XL oil pipeline project. McConnell added: ”Once a backer of the Keystone Pipeline, last year she opposed it.”  Clinton made her opposition to the project clear in September 2015. She was answering a question about climate change from a college student who was against the pipeline. Clinton said she opposed the project: ”I think it is imperative that we look at the Keystone Pipeline as what I believe it is: a distraction from the important work we have to do to combat climate change, and unfortunately, from my perspective, one that interferes with our ability to move forward to deal with all the other issues. Therefore, I oppose it.” But what was her position prior to that time? An analysis of some of her past comments about Keystone show something less definitive. ”Inclined” to back it was her answer in October 2010 when Clinton, then secretary of state, discussed the project at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco. There she was careful to add: ”We haven’t finished all of the analysis . .. we’ve not yet signed off on it. But we are inclined to do so.” Then, in June 2014: ”I can’t really comment at great length . .. the Obama administration is trying to get it right” was her answer while speaking to Canada’s Globe and Mail. When pressed on the question, Clinton said, ”I can’t respond.” In January 2015, Clinton again declined to give a position. ”We have differences and you won’t get me to talk about Keystone because I have steadily made clear that I’m not going to express an opinion,” she told an audience in Winnipeg. ”It is in our process and that’s where it belongs.” In July, 2015: ”I am not going to second guess (Obama) because I was in a position to set this in motion,” Clinton told a voter at a town hall event in New Hampshire. ”I want to wait and see what he and Secretary (John) Kerry decide.” She added, ”If it is undecided when I become President, I will answer your question.” In these instances, Clinton clearly avoided definitive support of the pipeline. Clinton carefully phrased her answers as ”inclined to” move ahead with the project. And as Clinton phrased it during CNN’s Democratic presidential debate in October 2015: ”I never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone.” Indeed. While her answer’s may exemplify ”politispeak” at its best, Clinton never stated definitively that the administration would support the pipeline. Our verdict on McConnell’s charge that Clinton changed positions on Keystone XL: false."
Obama Pledges to Lift All Sanctions Against Myanmar - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Obama pledged on Wednesday to lift all remaining sanctions against Myanmar, seeking to reward the country’s recent moves toward democracy after decades of brutal military rule. The White House issued the announcement during a visit by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s leader, whose victory in democratic elections last year was viewed by the Obama administration as a triumph in the president’s strategy of engaging with countries the United States had long shunned. “In part because of the progress that we’ve seen over the last several months,” Mr. Obama said in the Oval Office, as he sat beside Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, “the United States is now prepared to lift sanctions that we have imposed on Burma for quite some time. “It is the right thing to do in order to ensure that the people of Burma see rewards from a new way of doing business and a new government,” the president said. “Congratulations on the progress that has been made,” he told Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who was under house arrest as a political prisoner when Mr. Obama was elected president. “It is not complete, and I think Daw Suu is the first one to indicate that a lot of work remains to be done, but it’s on the right track. ” But the move was quickly criticized by leaders of some human rights groups, who said they worried that eliminating sanctions was premature given the slow pace of change in Myanmar, also known as Burma, where the military still controls a large portion of parliamentary seats and important government ministries. “If the issue was growing Burma’s economy, there are plenty of other ways to do that without pulling off all of these important restrictions, which have given Suu Kyi   leverage over the military, with whom she still has battles ahead,” said John Sifton, the deputy Washington director of Human Rights Watch. “If the issue is leverage, the decision today makes almost no sense: Obama and Suu Kyi just took important tools out of their collective tool kit for dealing with the Burmese military, and threw them into the garbage. ” It remained unclear exactly when the remaining sanctions would be lifted they apply to trade in jade and precious stones, and to doing business with some of Myanmar’s military officials or their affiliates. Restrictions imposed by Congress, including sanctions related to North Korea and those governing arms sales and military cooperation, will remain unless lawmakers vote to lift them. Mr. Obama had moved in May to ease a broad array of sanctions that barred American citizens and companies from doing business with Myanmar, loosening restrictions on   banks and entities. But, at that time, he left in place an official government finding of a state of emergency for Myanmar, which calls the country an “extraordinary threat. ” Earlier on Wednesday, Mr. Obama sent Congress official notice that he was restoring trade benefits to Myanmar that were revoked in 1989 because of concerns over worker rights, allowing it to qualify for a program that allows poor countries to export thousands of products   to the United States. The decision to go a step further, and scrap the sanctions entirely, reflects Mr. Obama’s belief in using diplomacy paired with sanctions relief to prod former foreign adversaries toward greater openness. That principle was at the heart of Mr. Obama’s agreement last year with Iran to relax sanctions in exchange for restraints on the country’s nuclear program, and has been the driving force behind the opening of a dialogue with Cuba. Since taking power six months ago, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has moved to heal ethnic conflicts that have long plagued Myanmar. She invited a team led by Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general, to begin investigating the plight of the Rohingya, a group of about a million Muslims living in dire conditions in western Myanmar. Yet Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi had declined to use the term “Rohingya” to describe the persecuted Muslim population that has lived in Myanmar for generations, angering rights activists who had hoped she would reverse discriminatory policies that have marginalized the Rohingya and prompted many to flee. And crucial political changes have yet to be made, like amending Myanmar’s Constitution to remove the military’s control over 25 percent of parliamentary seats, its ability to dissolve Parliament in times of national emergency and its control over the nation’s security, defense and border ministries. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said she was grateful to the United States for enacting sanctions that pressured Myanmar to restore human rights, but added that the time had come for the restrictions to be lifted. She also said she was eager to draw foreign visitors and investment to her country. Saying her first priority was “national reconciliation and peace,” Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi also conceded that she had to do more to shift the government toward civilian rule. “We have a Constitution that is not very democratic, because it gives the military a special place in politics,” she said. Obama administration officials have argued that freeing Myanmar from economic sanctions need not wait until the country liberalizes entirely, and that doing so will improve the chances that democracy will take hold there. It is also an important legacy issue for Mr. Obama, who said during a visit there in 2012 that it was time to open the United States’ relationship with Myanmar, despite the fact that it was not yet a “perfect democracy. ” On Wednesday, the White House insisted that Mr. Obama had not been swayed by a concern for his legacy to remove the sanctions before Myanmar had demonstrated more progress on its transition to democracy. “The president was quite interested in making as much progress as we can to support the Burmese people and the Burmese government in pursuing democratic reforms, but the decision to lift the national emergency was driven by the progress they made in Burma  —   not by the election calendar in the United States,” said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary."
Texas Border Cop Accused of Aiding Drug Cartel Operations,"RIO GRANDE CITY, Texas  —   A Texas border cop is believed to have helped dispose of weapons and vests used for kidnappings and murder on behalf of a Mexican   criminal organization. [The cop has also been accused of helping drug smugglers rip off the Gulf Cartel and providing them with police radios.  On Friday, federal agents with Homeland Security Investigations arrested Ramon “Ramey” De La Cruz Jr. a police officer with Rio Grande City Police, former deputy with Starr County Sheriff’s Office and son of local Justice of the Peace Ramon De La Cruz.   After spending the weekend in federal custody on September 19, the younger De La Cruz went before U. S. Magistrate Judge Dorina Ramos who ordered he be held without bond pending a detention hearing later this week.  Federal authorities charges De La Cruz with one count of possession of more than 1, 000 kilograms (2, 200 pounds) of marijuana with intent to distribute. While De La Cruz was directly charged, documents in his case point to him being part of a larger indictment against a criminal organization from Rio Grande City.  Court documents obtained by Breitbart Texas revealed that De La Cruz is believed to have been part of a drug smuggling and “rip crew” led by Ramiro Beltran and his family —  referred to as the Beltran drug trafficking organization. Court documents do not show a relationship between the Beltran group from Rio Grande City and the much larger   Drug Cartel in Mexico.  Government informants revealed to authorities that, in one case, a Gulf Cartel commander known as El Puma ordered that rifles and vests which had been used in a kidnapping and murder be placed in a box and buried in a property belonging to the Beltran family. The Beltran group had De La Cruz get rid of the weapons, which he did by taking them to a local gun store to be sold off.  The local Beltran Group has been tied to    activities with Mexico’s Gulf Cartel. However, the group would allegedly use De La Cruz to steal drugs from the cartel while making it seem like the drugs had been seized.  In order to fool the leaders of the Gulf Cartel, the Beltran group would use De La Cruz and other cops to reportedly provide false police reports showing that a drug load had been seized. The documents were doctored to reveal a larger seizures in order to allow the smugglers to claim that the whole load had been seized when in reality only a fraction was left behind for authorities.  De La Cruz has also been accused of providing his bosses in the Beltran group with police radios so that   smugglers could listen to law enforcement operations. The former deputy and current cop has also been accused of performing surveillance for the group’s smuggling attempts where they would pick up drugs at the banks of the Rio Grande and take them to a local stash house.

"Tancredo: Thanks Mr. President and Mitch McConnell, the GOP Is My Political Home Again - Breitbart","Donald Trump kept his word, Mitch McConnell played hardball, and together they triumphed over Chuck Schumer and the liberal establishment. April 7 should be marked on every patriot’s calendar as a turning point in history. [How long has it been since we had a policy victory of this magnitude? America now has a   chance to return to constitutional government.  If you think I am exaggerating the importance of having a true originalist in the Scalia chair on the Supreme Court, consider this question: If Neil Gorsuch had been writing the   majority opinion in the 2012 NFIB v. Sebelius challenge to Obamacare, would we still have Obamacare? No way, Jose. Adding Gorsuch to the Supreme Court is a historic turning point for three reasons besides the obvious one of having a strong conservative in Scalia’s chair. The Republican Party should heed the lessons taught by this victory if they want to actually govern the country instead of merely taking over the command of a doomed Titanic. First, the U. S. Senate Republicans showed unusual courage and uncharacteristic stamina. When Justice Scalia died suddenly in early 2016, President  Obama moved swiftly to fill the vacancy. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley decided the vacancy on the court should be filled by the winner of the 2016 presidential election and not by a lame duck incumbent. Indeed, no less an authority on Supreme Court vacancies than Democrat leader Chuck Schumer had proposed the same thing back in 2008 when George Bush was the lame duck. McConnell and the Senate Republicans held their ground despite the onslaught of criticism from the new power trilogy of the mainstream media, Hollywood comedians, and Obama Legacy stockholders. Then, in the middle of his campaign in 2016, candidate Donald Trump drew up a list of 21 conservative judges, made it public, and promised to select his first Supreme Court nominee from that list. Publishing that list was in itself radically unconventional and a bold gamble. But then he did a really unconventional thing and kept that promise by selecting Neil Gorsuch, a 10th Circuit Court judge who was probably among the two or three most conservative judges on that list of  . Golly, Batman, what next? !! And then came the coup de gras   —   not just ending opposition to Gorsuch but also giving Trump’s next Supreme Court nominee much better odds for confirmation. Democrats announced they would filibuster to block a full Senate vote on the Gorsuch appointment since it takes 60 votes to end a filibuster, not a simple majority of 51. Senate Republicans rose to the occasion by pulling the “nuclear trigger” ending the filibuster rule altogether, thereby not just stopping the filibuster against Gorsuch but also ending the filibuster threat against all future court nominees as well. Mitch McConnell had his finest hour as Senate Republican leader by holding that gang of 52 Republicans together and delivering on his promise to President Trump. All three elements of this miracle are worthy of praise —   Trump’s courage in publishing the list, his wisdom in selecting Gorsuch, and McConnell’s stellar leadership and political craftsmanship in delivering the victory despite universal, virulent Democrat opposition. Why is this victory so pivotal and so monumental? The answer is simple: a conservative majority on the U. S. Supreme Court is absolutely central to the survival of our Republic. The rule of law has become the rule of judges, and the Supreme Court is the final check on the rule of bad judges  —     which we have a few hundred in our federal courts thanks to decades of poor judicial appointments. Let us recall that the infamous 1973 Roe v. Wade   decision was written by a Republican nominee, Harry Blackman. More recently, Obamacare survived a court challenge because of the linguistic creativity of a Republican chief justice. The lessons to be learned from the Gorsuch victory are many, but this is the main one: We can restore the rule of law and true constitutionalism to the Supreme Court only if we have all three elements of the winning formula: a President with the wisdom to appoint the right judges, a Senate Republican leadership with the courage to fulfill its constitutional obligations, and a nation with a majority willing to support those choices. The Gorsuch appointment dwarfs in importance anything else Trump can or will do in the next four years and more than balances the inevitable disappointments and missteps he will send our way. Some people will think I am enthusiastic about Gorsuch only because he is likely to uphold Trump’s Executive Orders on immigration, but they are mistaken. I earnestly hope he will have the opportunity in the next few years to overturn bad precedents in Kelo (2005) Chevron (1984) and Roe (1973) decisions and many others. We can and will disagree with President Trump on some issues, such as trade policy, infrastructure boondoggles, and foreign policy mistakes like military involvement in Syria’s civil war. In fact, I may not agree with Trump’s every proposal or action on immigration and border security. But no matter: gaining conservative control of the Supreme Court makes the Trump presidency a success no matter what happens tomorrow. The Republican success in delivering the Gorsuch confirmation greatly overshadow the Republican Party’s many warts and weaknesses. I have decided to rejoin the Republican party as the best available vehicle for defending and sustaining our constitutional Republic."
E.P.A. Chief Doubts Consensus View of Climate Change - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said on Thursday that carbon dioxide was not a primary contributor to global warming, a statement at odds with the established scientific consensus on climate change. Asked his views on the role of carbon dioxide, the   gas produced by burning fossil fuels, in increasing global warming, Mr. Pruitt said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that “I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so, no, I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. ” “But we don’t know that yet,” he added. “We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis. ” Mr. Pruitt’s statement contradicts decades of research and analysis by international scientific institutions and federal agencies, including the E. P. A. His remarks on Thursday, which were more categorical than similar testimony before the Senate, may also put him in conflict with laws and regulations that the E. P. A. is charged with enforcing. His statements appear to signal that the Trump administration intends not only to roll back President Barack Obama’s climate change policies, but also to wage a vigorous attack on their underlying legal and scientific basis. A report in 2013 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of about 2, 000 international scientists that reviews and summarizes climate science, found it to be “extremely likely” that more than half the global warming that occurred from 1951 to 2010 was a consequence of human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. A January report by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration concluded, “The planet’s average surface temperature has risen about 2. 0 degrees Fahrenheit (1. 1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other   emissions into the atmosphere. ” Benjamin D. Santer, a climate researcher at the Energy Department’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, said, “Mr. Pruitt has claimed that carbon dioxide caused by human activity is not ‘the primary contributor to the global warming that we see.’ Mr. Pruitt is wrong. ” “The scientific community has studied this issue for decades,” Dr. Santer added. “The consensus message from many national and international assessments of the science is pretty simple: Natural factors can’t explain the size or patterns of observed warming. A large human influence on global climate is the best explanation for the warming we’ve measured and monitored. ” The basic science showing that carbon dioxide traps heat at the Earth’s surface dates to the 19th century, and has been confirmed in many thousands of experiments and observations since. Mr. Pruitt has faced frequent criticism for his close ties to fossil fuel companies. In his previous job as the attorney general of Oklahoma, he sought to use legal tools to fight environmental regulations on the oil and gas companies that are a major part of the state’s economy. A 2014 investigation by The New York Times found that energy lobbyists had drafted letters for Mr. Pruitt to send, on state stationery, to the E. P. A. the Interior Department, the Office of Management and Budget and even Mr. Obama, outlining the economic hardship caused by the environmental rules. But in a sign of how far outside mainstream views Mr. Pruitt’s remarks on Thursday have placed him, even executives of some of the nation’s largest fossil fuel producers said they were surprised by his comments. Interviewed at CERAweek, an annual conference of major energy producers this week in Houston, Wael Sawan, an executive vice president at Shell Energy Resources, said he was “absolutely convinced CO2 can cause serious damage to not only this generation but future generations. ” Mr. Pruitt spoke at the Houston energy conference on Thursday afternoon in a session moderated by Daniel Yergin, a prominent energy economist and a member of a White House advisory panel. Mr. Yergin did not ask Mr. Pruitt any questions about his remarks from Thursday morning, saying later that he had been unaware of the comments when interviewing him. Mr. Pruitt did not clarify his comments or respond to reporters who sought to question him. He said at the energy conference that the Obama administration had gone too far with some environmental rules and that he intended to work more closely with industry and individual states to address pollution issues. “The future ain’t what it used to be at the E. P. A. ,” he said. Mr. Pruitt’s remarks come as the Trump administration prepares to roll back Mr. Obama’s two signature policies to address global warming: a pair of sweeping regulations intended to curb carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles and power plant smokestacks. At the same time, the White House is considering a 17 percent cut to the budget of NOAA, one of the nation’s premier agencies of climate science research, according to a memo obtained by The Washington Post. Mr. Pruitt’s remarks on Thursday were consistent with his past public statements questioning the established science of   climate change, but in denying the role played by carbon dioxide, they go a step further. In addition to putting him at odds with the consensus of climate scientists, Mr. Pruitt’s remarks also raise the possibility that, as the Trump administration moves forward with unwinding Mr. Obama’s climate change regulations, it could put the administration in violation of federal law. In 2009, the E. P. A. released a legal opinion known as an endangerment finding concluding that, because of its contribution to global warming, carbon dioxide in large amounts met the Clean Air Act’s definition of a pollutant that harms human health. Under the terms of the Clean Air Act, one of the nation’s most powerful environmental laws, all such pollutants must be regulated by the E. P. A. A federal court upheld the finding, and the Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to it. Thus the E. P. A. remains obligated to regulate carbon dioxide. In his Senate hearing, Mr. Pruitt said that as administrator of the E. P. A. he would not revisit that 2009 legal finding. “It is there, and it needs to be enforced and respected,” Mr. Pruitt said. But energy lobbyists close to the Trump administration have since urged the new administration to consider building a legal case against the endangerment finding. Advisers to Mr. Trump’s transition team said they read Mr. Pruitt’s remarks as a signal that he intends to do just that. “President Trump’s campaign commitment was to undo President Obama’s entire climate edifice,” said Myron Ebell, who worked on Mr. Trump’s E. P. A. transition team but has no role in policy making. “They’re thinking through the whole thing, and based on what Scott Pruitt said this morning, I do think they are looking at reopening the endangerment finding. ” Mr. Trump is expected to announce an executive order next week directing Mr. Pruitt to begin the legal process of unwinding the climate change regulations on emissions from power plants."
Democrats think Trump won on economic issues — but exit polls offer a more complicated story,"’  ’ ’   Hillary Clinton has laid the blame on her upset election   loss to Donald Trump on . ’ ’   ’ ’   ”The Democratic Party failed to offer a compelling jobs   message for everybody,” Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo, an early   Clinton supporter, told Business Insider in a recent interview. ’ ’   Clinton ”did win Rhode Island by a couple digits,” she   added. ”But a lot of the areas that went for Trump in Rhode   Island are places where people are feeling like they’’re left   behind in this economy. And I think that as I’’m out and   about talking to Rhode Islanders, there’’s still a high degree of   anxiety about my economic future.” ’ ’   But while some Democrats  and  that prioritizes pocketbook   issues over identity politics, others point to data   suggesting a more complicated understanding of why Clinton failed   to win in the former Rust Belt states. ’ ’’ ’   An examination of the exit polls in  revealed that the economy was by far the most   important issue to votes. But those who reported the economy   as their top issue  —   at least in the abstract    —   believed that Clinton had a stronger message. ’ ’   In Michigan, 52% of voters said the economy was ”most   important issue facing the country,”   Clinton won by 6 points   among people who reported that the economy was the most important   issue, while Obama only won on that issue by   3 points.  ’ ’   In Pennsylvania, Clinton won by 4 points among the 56% of   voters who reported that the economy was most important   issue facing the country. In 2012, Romney won by 5 points   among the 61% of voters concerned most about the economy. ’ ’   The results were even more stark in Wisconsin. While about the   same percentage of voters said the economy was the ”most   important issue facing the country” in 2016 and 2012  —   55% and   56% respectively  —   Clinton won those voters by 11 points, while   Romney won on the issue by a single point in 2012. ’ ’   Matt McDermott, a senior analyst at Whitman Insight Strategies,   acknowledged that while Democrats ”need to do a better   job” of connecting with workers concerned about economic and   personal finance issues, ”it’’s not the reason Hillary   Clinton lost this election.” ’ ’   ”There’’s really no unifying ’’big picture’’ campaign fault that   emerges as the reason why she lost them,” McDermott said,   referring to the three states. ”In part, this is because these   three states were each handled in markedly different ways by the   Clinton campaign, and yet each was lost by an equally small   margin.” ’ ’   He added: ’ ”   But while voters in these states had more faith in Clinton   in the abstract, they were more attracted to individual   aspects of Trump’s economic message, including his vehement   opposition to the   Partnership, his vague promise to   bring back US manufacturing jobs and punish companies that   outsource jobs, and his criticism of immigrants living in the US   illegally. ” ’   Exit polls themselves can be unreliable. Those that   survey early voters are . And for those conducted   on Election Day, the exit polls  skew toward counties and precincts with higher   incomes and education levels. ’ ’   Yet the exit polls also offered other explanations for why voters   supported Trump over Clinton. ’ ’   Trump won overwhelmingly among voters in  and  who craved ”change,” which voters in both   states said was, in the abstract, the most important quality they   sought in a candidate. ’ ’   ”We don’’t live in a monocausal world  —   one answer will not   explain a phenomenon,” said Michael Traugott, a professor and   polling expert at University of Michigan. ”Clinton did not   deliver a sustained economic message, and doing a better job on   that cold have helped here win across the country and in those   three close states. But it’’s also true that if she traveled there   instead of elsewhere, or advertised on TV, or if there had been   no Comey letter, etc. she could have done better as well.” ’ ”   Many top Democrats and some polling analysts long dismissed   Trump’s early campaign boasts that he could carve a new   electorate through the Rust Belt. And in the end, whatever the   cause, it came back to bite them. ” ”   In July, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti rejected the idea that   Trump’s rhetoric and proposals on immigration will help him win   Rust Belt states. ” ’   During a conference call, he told Business Insider: ”Millennials,   younger Americans, even those who are Gen X overwhelmingly   support immigration reform, even in the most working class,   Midwestern, Rust Belt states.” ’"
Rio de Janeiro Governor: Olympics May Be ’Big Failure’,"The governor of Rio de Janeiro state, Francisco Dornelles, told the Brazilian newspaper O Globo on Monday that the Summer Olympics hosted in the state’s capital city may be a “big failure” due to the pervasive lack of funding for health and security infrastructure, leaving tourists and athletes exposed to crime and disease. [“I am optimistic about the games, but I have to show the reality,” Dornelles told the paper. “We can make a great Olympics, but if some steps are not taken, it can be a big failure. ”  “Without security and no subway, there will be difficulties,” he argued. “How will people get to places without underground transportation? How will people feel protected in the city without security? We have to give proof that we are equipping security and the ready mobility for people to come to the country. ” Dornelles says the subway line designed to transport Olympic tourists to athletic venues is not ready and may not be ready by August. As for security, police forces only have enough money to pay for gasoline through this week. Without an emergency bailout from the federal government, Rio’s police department may be grounded. Regarding health facilities, Dornelles described the situation as “calamitous. ” He said, “The Health Minister is crying in my cabinet and, for me, that is very painful. ” The health and security issues are deeply intertwined last week, the hospital designated for the use of Olympic athletes and tourists was the scene of a dramatic shootout in which up to 15 drug traffickers broke into the hospital to free a drug lord known as “Fat Family. ” A patient was shot dead. Crime has become enough of a problem to directly affect athletes. Last week, a Paralympian was mugged in broad daylight while training in the city, a sign of the lack of fear criminals have that police will do anything to stop them. Dornelles declared a “public calamity” last week, stating in a decree demanding federal emergency funding that the lack of money to pay for public services has “been causing severe difficulties in the provision of essential public services and can even cause a total breakdown in public security, health, education, mobility and environmental management. ” He is waiting for Brasilia to expedite $900 million in emergency funds to pay for police and workers on Olympic venues. Dornelles stated that the first priority for these funds will be paying construction workers completing Olympic projects. “Having a person working an entire month and not paying is a form of slave labor,” he told O Globo. He also attempted to explain how Rio de Janeiro got to the financial state it is in today: in short, too many social programs for a population that is working less and less. “Many retire too early.   …     There was a wage increase.   …     We were forced to greatly increase the number of police officers, teachers.   …     The state predicted an economy growing between 3% and 4% when it was the opposite. ” He has previously warned that he expects to take “some pretty tough measures” to restore the economic viability of the state.  O Globo reports that the ruling party in Brasilia is not pleased with Dornelles’ vocal proclamations of failure. “There is a very, very high degree of irritation at Planalto Palace,” a blurb in the newspaper’s political blogs claimed this week. Planalto is the presidential palace, home to acting President Michel Temer while Dilma Rousseff completes the impeachment process. The Brazilian legislature voted to impeach Rousseff earlier this year, ensuring she would not be presiding over the Summer Olympics. Since then, both the Brazilian federal government and the International Olympic Commission (IOC) have been working to attract tourists and keep athletes competing in the games, despite the barrage of negative publicity surrounding the Games. The IOC has claimed the declaration of fiscal crisis will have “zero impact” on the games and that the necessary subway line will be complete. Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes has claimed the decree is a way to ensure that Rio has “financial comfort” when administering the games, not a    measure. In addition to crime and health concerns, Rio de Janeiro is home to some of the world’s most polluted water  —   which athletes are expected to swim through  —   and the largest outbreak of the Zika virus in the world so far. Zika has already scared a number of   athletes away from coming to Rio and competing, particularly in golf."

Politicians knock Trump on human rights promotion,"Washington (CNN) Politicians from both parties knocked President Donald Trump on Sunday for not making a forceful case for human rights during a speech in Saudi Arabia. In his speech, Trump said he was not there to ”lecture” Muslim countries, but he did call for nations to promote ”the aspirations and dreams of all citizens who seek a better life    including women, children and followers of all faiths.” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on ”Fox News Sunday” that the primary purpose of the visit was to confront the threat of terrorism, and that human rights would improve as security and stability in the region did. ”The way you address those human rights issues and women’s rights issues is to improve the conditions in the region,” Tillerson said. ”There are efforts underway to, I think, improve the rights of women, the participation of women in society throughout the region.”  ’Drive them out’: Trump calls on Muslims to share burden in terror fight, Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said on CNN’s ”State of the Union” that Trump had the ”right message” on working with Muslim nations to fight terrorism, but decried what he saw as an attempt to ” ” human rights and the promotion of democracy abroad. ”I think that would be a terrible abdication of our global leadership when it comes to advocating for people who are the subject of persecution,” Schiff said. In an interview on the same program, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican, said the ”lecture” line certainly wouldn’t have been in a speech of his, illustrating the gulf between his preferred approach and that of the White House.  ”I’m much more forceful and open and vocal about criticizing, whether it’s Egypt or Saudi Arabia for its human rights record,” Rubio said. ”The White House is convinced they can get better results by addressing those issues in private,   .” Arizona Sen. John McCain said on Fox that while the President’s Saudi Arabia trip was going well, it needed to include a robust call for US values. ”We have to stand up for what we believe in,” McCain said. Many of the autocratic nations in the region, including Saudi Arabia, have severe restrictions on women’s rights and participation in society. Under the Saudis’ strict Wahhabi interpretation of Islam, for example, women cannot drive, open bank accounts, work, travel or go to school without the express permission of a male guardian. In 2011, the country beheaded a woman for ”witchcraft and sorcery.”  Saudi Arabia’s poor track record on human rights forced the Obama administration to strike an awkward balance between condemning its human rights abuses and maintaining its support in the fight against terrorism. In the final weeks of the previous administration, the US also halted some arms sales to the kingdom over its killing of civilians in Yemen’s civil war. Trump, however, inked an arms deal with Saudi Arabia on Saturday worth over $100 billion, signaling a renewed commitment to the alliance. Democratic and Republican presidents since Franklin Delano Roosevelt have looked past Saudi Arabia’s treatment of its own people to build stronger ties with the royal family there even while calling for the spread of democracy and human rights around the world."

Paris shooting overshadows election campaign,"Paris (CNN) A deadly attack on a police bus in the heart of Paris has dramatically changed the course of the French presidential election campaign. The three main candidates canceled campaign events and instead made televised statements in which they competed to talk tough on security and vowed a crackdown on ISIS.  One police officer died after a gunman wielding a machine gun leapt out of a car and opened fire on the   Paris’s most famous boulevard, as candidates were engaging in their final TV debate. The   candidate, Marine Le Pen, demanded the closure of all Islamist mosques. Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve accused her of trying to capitalize on the attack. ISIS swiftly claimed the attack was carried out by one of its ”fighters.” The assailant    Karim Cheurfi, a    French national with a long and violent criminal record    was shot dead as he tried to make his escape. Prosecutors said a note defending ISIS fell out of his pocket, although there was no previous evidence of radicalization. He was also carrying the addresses of police stations. French authorities, including the domestic security service, began a counterterrorism investigation into Cheurfi last month after learning of his increasing determination to establish communication with an ISIS fighter in Syria and Iraq, a source close to the investigation told CNN Friday. Election in turmoil,   candidate François Fillon, Le Pen and independent centrist Emmanuel Macron canceled planned campaign events after the shooting. Under French election rules, Friday was due to be the final day of campaigning before Sunday’s first round of voting. It was unclear whether the attack would tip the balance of the vote in favor of Le Pen, who has vowed to take a tough line on ”Islamic terrorism.”  At a televised news conference Friday, Le Pen called for the closure of all ”Islamist” mosques in France, the expulsion of hate preachers and the reinstatement of French borders. People on the French security services’ watch list for radicalization should also be expelled from France and have their French citizenship revoked, she said.   How the Paris shooting could shape the French election, Cazeneuve said Le Pen seeks to exploit fear ”for exclusively political ends.”  ”The candidate of the Front National, like every drama, seeks to profit from and to control the situation to divide,” the Prime Minister said in a televised address. Fillon said that if elected, his foreign policy priority would be the destruction of ISIS. He also called for the creation of 10, 000 more police posts. ”In times such as these we have to demonstrate that France is united,” he said. ”We also have to be clear that we are in a state of emergency. We are at war. This fight for freedom and for the security of the French people must be the priority of the next   term.” Cazeneuve, however, questioned Fillon’s position on security, saying that when he previously served as Prime Minister he had cut thousands of security force jobs. Macron appealed to voters not to succumb to fear. ”Do not give in to fear, do not give in to division, do not give in to intimidation,” he said. ”The choice that you have to make on Sunday must be a choice for the future.”  Macron said he would hire an additional 10, 000 police officers in the next five years and that he would create a task force under the French Presidency to fight ISIS.  Leftist candidate   Melenchon urged the French people to ”remain  ” and ”to not subject ourselves to hate, vengeance and resentment.” Terror investigation, On its media channel, Amaq, ISIS claimed that the attack was carried out by ”Abu Yousuf   (the Belgian) and he is one of the Islamic State’s fighters.”   Belgian Interior Ministry spokesman Olivier Van Raemdonck told CNN the attacker was not Belgian and that there did not appear to be a Belgian connection to the incident. It is not clear to whom ISIS was referring in its claim.   A man who turned himself in to Antwerp police was Youssef El Osri. The man’s lawyer, Nabil Riffi, told CNN his client was ”very shocked” at being linked to the Paris shooting and that he had been working at a gas station in Antwerp at the time it occurred.  Security in Paris has been stepped up in recent days, but the presence of 50, 000 police officers on the streets was not enough to prevent the latest assault, which was being investigated by   officials. French President François Hollande convened a meeting of the country’s defense council Friday. Paris Police identified the dead officer as Xavier Jugele. He was 37, Paris Prosecutor François Molins said. One of the wounded officers was critically injured but is improving, Molins said. Also wounded was a female tourist. Molins said the attacker had a long criminal record. He spent 11 years in jail after shooting two police officers in 2001. While in custody, he shot and injured a prison officer after grabbing his gun. He was jailed again in 2013 for lesser offenses and released on probation two years later. Molins said Cheurfi was investigated by counterterror officials in late Febrary because of alleged threats he made to kill police officers. He was briefly placed under house arrest and investigators discovered knives and masks in his home but no evidence linking him to terror groups, Molins said.   Despite his long criminal record, Cheurfi was never placed under what is known as a ”Fiche S” surveillance file, Molins told reporters. Molins did not clarify if Cheurfi had been on other surveillance lists in France excluding the ”Fiche S” file. Cheurfi never showed any sign of radicalization during his previous detention, Molins said. Molins said investigators were trying to determine whether the attacker had accomplices.   Three members of his family were arrested in the Paris suburb of Chelles early Friday morning. Earlier this week French authorities arrested two men in Marseille who were allegedly planning an attack in a   to the election. World leaders react, Speaking in Indonesia Friday, US Vice President Mike Pence said the attack was just the latest reminder ”that terrorism can strike anywhere at any time.”  US President Donald Trump, at a news conference in Washington, said: ”What can you say? It never ends.” German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her sympathy ”goes out to the victims and their families,” according to her spokesman Steffen Seibert.  In a statement, the UK government said it ”strongly condemns the appalling terrorist attack in Paris.”  France has been in a state of emergency since the 2015 Paris attacks, which left 130 people dead. Parliament voted in December to extend the extraordinary provisions to ensure the protection of upcoming presidential and general elections. Correction: This story has been updated to clarify the extent to which French intelligence authorities were monitoring Karim Cheurfi before the attack."
"James O’Neill, Officer Since 1983, Will Step Into Police Dept.’s Top Job - The New York Times","For months, Chief James P. O’Neill was the man in the blue uniform with four gold stars standing, shoulders square, just behind Police Commissioner William J. Bratton in his pressed suits and Hermès ties. On Tuesday, Chief O’Neill stepped to the center: Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that he would become the next commissioner of the New York Police Department after Mr. Bratton steps down next month. The   uniformed officer in the department, Chief O’Neill, 58, has become an increasingly familiar face on the local news, around the city and at City Hall, ready at news conferences and in private meetings with answers for his boss or the mayor. They often summon him with a familiar call, using just his first name. “I always call him Jimmy,” Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said while inviting him to the lectern on Tuesday. Chief O’Neill began his career in 1983, in the old Transit Police, and is steeped in the city’s policing culture. Yet as Mr. de Blasio took office vowing to reform many embattled and longstanding police practices, such as stop, question and frisk, Chief O’Neill was also among those eager to embrace change, spearheading the department’s effort at a new incarnation of neighborhood policing. “I know exactly how valuable and how fragile it is at times, this relationship between law enforcement and the community actually is,” he said on Tuesday at the City Hall announcement. “This is truly a shared effort and shared responsibility. ” It was Chief O’Neill who sent a team of officers to Los Angeles to study that city’s community policing program, which influenced the plans the New York Police Department was developing to foster better   relations. He has been at the helm in overseeing security planning for major events, like the annual session of the United Nations General Assembly and the visit last year of Pope Francis. For months, Chief O’Neill’s public profile has been growing as Mr. Bratton appeared to be grooming him to be the face of the department. The two men met in 1990, when Mr. Bratton came to New York from Boston to take over the Transit Police and Mr. O’Neill was a young supervisor running its video unit. Mr. Bratton used the unit to hone his image within the department, producing videos for the rank and file, and producing commercials and public service messages for the public. When Mr. Bratton returned and was reunited with Mr. O’Neill, it was a reunion of mutual benefit. After languishing for nearly a decade as a deputy chief under Raymond W. Kelly, the commissioner at the time, Chief O’Neill was promoted twice in short order by Mr. Bratton, first to chief of patrol and then to chief of department. It was a remarkable career turn for Chief O’Neill, who had been pushed out of his post as the commander of the department’s narcotics operations after an internal sting operation found officers paying informants with drugs. Chief O’Neill was one of several commanders transferred amid the scandal, which led prosecutors to dismiss many cases involving the officers implicated. The last two years have been quite different. Commissioner Bratton and Chief O’Neill have enjoyed a warm relationship, with Mr. Bratton occasionally teasing Chief O’Neill at news conferences. Those lighter moments  —   including on Tuesday when Mr. Bratton ribbed Chief O’Neill about his baldness  —   elicit the friendlier side of a chief who can seem, with his starched uniform and military bearing, to be distant and cool. Some elected officials have said that they worked well with Chief O’Neill as chief of department. Representative Hakeem Jeffries, an advocate of criminal justice reform, described the chief as “very qualified, personable and  . ” “Chief O’Neill is a good man, who has always had an   relationship with leaders of diverse backgrounds throughout the city,” Mr. Jeffries, a Brooklyn Democrat, said on Tuesday. Late last month, when Mr. Bratton said in an interview with The New York Times that he would be leaving the department before the start of a potential second term for Mr. de Blasio, he talked openly about his admiration for Chief O’Neill and suggested that the chief would be a worthy successor. On Tuesday, the mayor made that a reality. In an earlier interview, Chief O’Neill also said he admired Mr. Bratton’s touch  —   making officers feel that they are being listened to and trusted. “Obviously, he wants cops to do a great job. But he also wants them to feel good about themselves and to have that sense of fulfillment,” Chief O’Neill said of Mr. Bratton in January. “That is different from the prior administration. ” As the news came out on Tuesday morning, a group of uniformed officers from various Bronx precincts who had assembled at an outdoor   session greeted the shift with enthusiasm. “He rose through the ranks, that’s for sure,” Officer Dan Conti, of the 47th Precinct, said as he stood with colleagues near the Grand Concourse. Others nodded. “He’s a pretty good boss,” Officer Conti added. Chief O’Neill’s ascension is unusual. Thomas Repetto, author of a history of the department, said a chief of department had not been promoted to commissioner in more than four decades. Rather, mayors have typically reached further down in the leadership, or more often outside the department, for new commissioners. Before moving into senior posts, Chief O’Neill served as a commander of three precincts: the 25th in East Harlem, the 44th in the Bronx and Central Park. He knows what it is like to face high crime and thousands of homicides a year. But now, with crime boiled down to much lower levels, he has embraced the shifts the administration has wrought: focusing on people, places and conditions that drive crime. “Fighting crime is what we get paid to do,” Chief O’Neill said in January. “But we can’t do that unless we have the backing of the community. Unless we have that connectivity, it’s not going to work. ” As he spoke on Tuesday in City Hall’s Blue Room, Chief O’Neill, who is separated and has two sons in their 20s, faced his mother, who sat in the front row. He choked up, recalling the advice she gave while he was growing up, one of seven siblings in the East Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn. “To be a sound and moral man,” his mother, Helen O’Neill, told reporters afterward. “And to always do the right thing, and he has. ” Ms. O’Neill said she was in awe of her son, who likes Irish soda bread,   motorcycle rides and discussing with her the books he has read. “He’s more than what you see,” she said."
Knesset Bill Proposes Annexing All Jerusalem-Area Settlements,"TEL AVIV  —   A new bill to annex the settlements around Jerusalem will be submitted to the Knesset this week, the Jerusalem Post reported. [MK Yehuda Glick (Likud) is advancing the private member’s legislation, which would cover   of the 386, 000 settlers in Judea and Samaria residing in communities including Ma’aleh Adumim, Givat Ze’ev, Adam, Psagot, Ma’aleh Michmash and the Gush Etzion bloc.  A similar bill annexing Ma’aleh Adumim has been submitted and is awaiting approval from the Ministerial Committee for Legislation. But according to Glick, annexing Ma’aleh Adumim alone is not enough. Applying sovereignty to all the communities around Jerusalem would strengthen the capital and distance the notion of a Palestinian state, Glick said. He added that the bill has already garnered support from Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely and Transportation Minister Israel Katz. He noted that his bill comes at an auspicious time, ahead of the 50th anniversary of the Six Day War that saw Judea and Samaria liberated from Jordan, and as such this should be “the year of sovereignty. ” The new bill comes on the heels of a series of annexation attempts put forward by nationalist politicians here since President Donald Trump came into office. So far, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not supported efforts toward annexation, fearing it would cause too much backlash from the U. S. and international community. Instead, he favors a scenario in which the U. S. would lend its support for building within existing settlements. A group of nationalist politicians from the Knesset Land of Israel Caucus published an open letter to Netanyahu Sunday, urging him “to seize the opportunity provided by the entry of the new U. S. administration   …     [and] prevent the establishment of an Arab terrorist state in the Land of Israel, and to stand for freedom, prosperity and building of communities throughout Judea and Samaria. ”  "
Pat Caddell: Democrat Voters Worried About Clinton’s Health,"In offering analysis of the ongoing presidential election, longtime Democratic pollster Pat Caddell told Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow on Thursday how surprised he is that health has been at the forefront. [“One of the things I am surprised about is apparently how much the health issue has affected this race, or seems to be affecting it,” said Caddell. “Yesterday, there were two polls. Morning Consult and Rasmussen had very similar numbers. ”  Caddell continued: The health issue overall is very much a partisan issue, but that doesn’t account for almost the same numbers here, which, I’m going to read you the question: “As you know, Hillary Clinton left an event on September 11th earlier than scheduled due to health concerns. It was later revealed to be pneumonia. Do you think Hillary’s health concerns negatively impact her ability to serve as President?”   yes   no. Rasmussen has a similar question:   yes   no. “This is in their heads. This is in their consciousness,” said Caddell, speaking of Clinton’s health issue. “It is one of the things worrying them.   …     Democratic groups, too  —   and that can be deadly. ” Caddell went on to discuss recently released polls, including ones showing Trump leading nationally and in the swing states of Ohio, Florida, and Nevada.

Kamau Bell: Standing Rock changed how I see America," (CNN) Earlier this week, Sen. Orrin Hatch, in discussing a proposal for a new monument that had been requested by five tribes native to the United States, said something that should have been reported far and wide. It was something so egregious it should have led those close to him to tell him to sit down and take a few deep breaths before speaking again. It was so nonsensical and offensive that even President Donald Trump should have said, ”Are you kidding me? Who talks like that?”  In advocating for his own (and Trump’s) plans for the land where the indigenous people of this country instead want a monument, Hatch said, ”The Indians, they don’t fully understand that a lot of the things that they currently take for granted on those lands, they won’t be able to do if it’s made clearly into a monument or a wilderness,” And as if that wasn’t enough the senator from Utah went on to say, ”Once you put a monument there, you do restrict a lot of things that could be done, and that includes use of the land. . .. Just take my word for it.” So let me get this straight. Hatch not only doesn’t believe that these five (five!) tribes are capable of understanding what they want and what is ultimately good for them, but the senator also wants them to . .. take his word for it. Well unfortunately for you, senator, the word of the US government hasn’t historically meant much    if anything    to Native Americans. Since its inception, the government has broken and coerced treaties with hundreds of Native American tribes. And this is even worse when you realize that the native peoples of this land are negotiating for land that is by all common sense and elementary school logic their land. Because no matter what Woody Guthrie’s famous song says, this land is not your land or my land. That is unless you happen to be a member of one the 562 federally recognized tribes of this land.  I can’t imagine what it must be like to be one of the indigenous people of the United States of America. I can’t imagine watching the news every day    as people debate whose country this is and who should be in charge of it and how to make it great again    and hardly ever see your people brought into the discussion. As a black person in this country, I am always frustrated by the lack of attention my people’s issues get. But at least the news and politicians are talking about not talking about our issues. Native issues are basically ignored.  That was overwhelmingly the case until last year when the media began to report on the camps at the Standing Rock Reservation in North and South Dakota. But even most of them got that story wrong. The reports made it seem like it was just a dispute over land. It was, in part. But the bigger story was that the tribes came together to protect the water. And they weren’t just protecting their water, they were protecting everyone’s    because that’s how water works. The water that runs under Standing Rock is the same water that runs under the ground in cities that aren’t on reservations.  Tribes from all over    who have no direct contact with Standing Rock    showed up to help the people there protect what was already    and rightfully    theirs. And they did this for a multitude of reasons. For one, they knew the act of an oil company being allowed by the federal government to lay a pipeline under land that belongs to the Standing Rock tribe without the tribe’s permission was a symbol of how the government has historically and consistently treated native peoples. They also knew it wasn’t just a battle for land it was (and is) a battle for millions of   Americans, who didn’t even know enough to show up and fight alongside of the native peoples.  This Sunday on ”United Shades of America With W. Kamau Bell,” you’ll see me go to Standing Rock to see if I could hear what the real story was. I also spent time at the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, one of the poorest places in the country, to get a sense of what    life is like there  These were truly   experiences for me. The unique nature of the action at Standing Rock combined with the honesty, pain and humor of all the conversations    including one with a mother and father on Pine Ridge whose son had been killed only days before I talked to them    took my breath away and also somehow inspired me.  I talked with actor and activist Adam Beach about the challenges of being a native actor in Hollywood, an industry that as he put it wants his people permanently ”back in the 1800s.” I spoke with activist and former congressional candidate Chase Iron Eyes about how he and his wife made the choice to move their family back to the Standing Rock Reservation, even though they had to downsize and sacrifice many of the   comforts to do so. They just felt pulled back home. At Standing Rock, I even ran into my friend, activist and artist Ben Alex Dupris, who gave me a course in Tepee 101. And then he and his friends gave me the gift of an experience I’ll never forget. When you watch the show (and I know you will!) you will see we were at Standing Rock last year when the camps were at full strength. Acres of land were covered with tents and, yes, tepees. It had the joyful, energized feeling that I think people try to capture at Burning Man and Coachella, but the main difference being no one was appropriating culture here. The headdresses and clothing were all being worn by the people whose ancestors had designed those originally. And also, at Standing Rock, no one was taking a break from their regular life to have fun and see some bands. The various tribes were there on a mission.  And let me be clear, they still could use our help in their attempt to help all of us. And not just because of ignorant, condescending and IMHO racist slights by Orrin Hatch. They need our help protecting our water. One of President Barack Obama’s last acts was to stop construction of the pipeline. But one of Trump’s first acts was to start it back up again.  And on Wednesday, it was reported that the Dakota Access Pipeline leaked 84 gallons of oil in early April. Most media outlets described it as a ”small leak” that was cleaned up quickly. I know small is relative, but do me a favor. Go buy 84 gallons of milk and spill them in your living room and tell me how small that is. And see if no matter how much Febreze you use, you’re not smelling fetid cheese for the rest of your lease. And remember, the pipeline is not even fully operational yet, and it’s already leaking.  I haven’t asked the folks I talked to during the episode, but I’m sure none was surprised. After centuries of broken and disrespected treaties, nothing can faze you. And yet hope remains. But don’t take it from me. I’m just another   whose mom told him we were  . For once, let’s listen to them."
Obama’s year-end message: I did it right,"Washington (CNN) President Barack Obama wants America to know this: he did the right thing. He may harbor frustration and even anger that the nation’s polarization and the geopolitics of a volatile world thwarted him in many ways, but he won’t spend his looming retirement stewing in regret. In fact, the President made a case Friday that his administration is a historic success, despite beginning in a riot of hopeful euphoria and ending, according to First Lady Michelle Obama, with many Americans now living without hope after the election of Donald Trump, In his final press conference of the year, the President justified his actions on issues ranging from the economy to Syria, and from the Russia hacking scandal to the passage of Obamacare    a historic law now on borrowed time. Obama will have a formal chance to say goodbye next month, but in a long    and sometimes defensive    appearance in the White House Briefing Room, it was clear that at least in his own mind his presidential legacy is already set. ”I am very proud of the work I’ve done. I think I’m a better president now than when I started,” Obama said. As he surveyed his two terms, Obama did not argue that he had always been successful, but made a case that he had always had the best of motives and that where he had failed it was often owing to a lack of better choices. He seemed intent on placing his legacy    with which he feels satisfied despite the shock of an election result which traumatized Democrats    in what he sees as its proper historical context. Where Obama showed dissatisfaction it was not with his own record, but with the Republicans who opposed him, the press who he believes overly dwell in trivialities and the coarsening of political culture. He delivered only veiled criticism of Trump, amid deepening tension between the   and the White House over the Russia hacking scandal and his only real fury were reserved for Russian President Vladimir Putin. And as the world watches in helpless horror at the human carnage in Aleppo, Obama admitted he agonized over Syria more than any other issue. But he could not see anything he could have done differently, despite criticism that he should have used military action to oust President Bashar   or acted earlier and more forcefully to arm   rebels. ”I always feel responsible,” Obama said. ”There are places around the world where horrible things are happening and because of my office, because I’m President of the United States, I feel responsible. I ask myself every single day, ’Is there something I could do that would save lives and make a difference and spare some child who doesn’t deserve to suffer? ’” But displaying the   realism that has infuriated critics, Obama reasoned that only a massive deployment by an already exhausted American military could have turned the tide. His only choice therefore was to use diplomacy to stem the bloodletting. ”I cannot claim that we have been successful. That’s something that, as is true with a lot of issues and problems around the world, I have to go to bed with every night,” Obama said. ”But I continue to believe that it was the right approach given what realistically we could get done.” Obama also rebuffed criticism that he had been slow to respond to allegations of Russian cybermeddling in the presidential election. ”My primary concern was making sure that the integrity of the election process was not in any way damaged, at a time when anything that was said by me or anybody in the White House would immediately be seen through a partisan lens,” Obama explained. He also said curtly that when he met Putin in China in September he told him to ”cut it out” and pledged to hit Russia in public and covert ways before he leaves office on January 20. ’You can’t argue that we are not better off’ With the GOP ax hovering over Obamacare, the President mounted a firm defense of an initiative that in retrospect drained his administration    and Democrats in general    of huge stocks of political capital. ”When I came into office, 44 million people were uninsured. Today, we have covered more than 20 million of them. For the first time in our history, more than 90% of Americans are insured.” Obama did not address the uncertainty many Americans now again face over health care or rising premiums and deductibles. Reprising a familiar theme, Obama went back to the economic turmoil raging when he took office in the teeth of the worst recession in decades in 2009. ”As I was preparing to take office, the unemployment rate was on its way to 10%. Today it is at 4. 6% the lowest in nearly a decade.” Though he noted that some people were still homeless, hungry or had trouble paying the bills, Obama did not refer directly to the legions of Midwestern voters who feel left behind by his recovery and helped elect Trump. Abroad, Obama noted, for the umpteenth time, the slaying of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, and noted that he had brought 165, 000 troops home. But wars still rage in Iraq and Afghanistan. But though his legacy may be imperfect, Obama is making no apologies. ”What I can say with confidence is that what we’ve done works. That I can prove. I can show you where we were in 2008 and I can show you where we are now. And you can’t argue that we are not better off. We are.” Pointing fingers at Republicans, media, Obama lingered on the Republicans who opposed him and a press corps he believes contributed to the White House’s and Democrats’ problems. He flashed contempt for GOP Russia hawks now ready to accept Trump’s admiration of Putin. ”Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave,” he said. He lashed out at Putin and Assad for ”savage” assaults on Aleppo and was particularly disdainful of Russia itself. ”The Russians can’t change us or significantly weaken us. They are a smaller country, they are a weaker country, their economy doesn’t produce anything that anybody wants to buy except oil and gas and arms. They don’t innovate.” Obama told reporters the coverage of Hillary Clinton during the campaign was troubling. But he also did seem to implicitly jab Clinton’s campaign tactics when he said that Democrats need to show up where people are hurting. ”Democrats are characterized as coastal, liberal,   you know, politically correct,    folks. We have to be in those communities.” The President also denied tensions between he and Trump, as his own aides and those of the   spar over the Russia hacking of emails belonging to the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Where he criticized Trump it was implicit, as when he said China would not stand for the  ’s warning that the status of Taiwan could be on the table in his increasingly acrimonious relationship with Beijing. And he warned that there was a difference between campaigning and being President  —   a reality Trump has yet to embrace. ”I think there is a sobering process when you walk into the Oval Office,” Obama said. In many ways, Obama, a president especially conscious of history, seemed to be subtly setting up a contrast with the Trump presidency to come. ”What the   is going to be doing is going to be very different than what I was doing,” Obama said, ”and I think people will be able to compare and contrast and make judgments about what worked for the American people.”"
European turmoil: The new normal?," (CNN) A new normal shrouds Europe now. Questions we didn’t ask last summer: What next? Where will I be? Who will l know? Is my life less safe? The attacks in Belgium, France and Germany amplify anxieties over Brexit, Frexit, an unraveling of an order dictated by the European Union.  The fabric of cohesion offering peace, prosperity and security patiently woven over decades suddenly feels like a paper bag in a summer storm. Ready to rip. As once   landing ships disgorged allied liberators on Normandy’s beaches rescuing Europe from Nazism’s grim grasp, so today new nooses tighten    radical Islam and rampant nationalism. The ghastly execution of a priest in a Normandy church cinched the rope uncomfortably tighter. The cord has been cutting deeper for a while now.  Charlie Hebdo, the November 13 Paris attacks, Brussels airport and metro, Nice.  The day before the murder of a French priest near Rouen, a rock concert in Germany was the target of a suicide bomber with allegiances to ISIS. Only the bomber dead, no disrespect for the injured but a moment where we might have breathed a little easier. It could have been so much worse. The reality is: We were lucky, that was all. Why ISIS is targeting Catholic Church, The reality of Europe’s security struggles, After the IRA narrowly missed killing British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher by blowing up the hotel where she was sleeping in Brighton 1986 they are reported as having said, ”we only have to be lucky once, you have to be lucky every time.” Today, Europe’s security services, particularly in the North, are struggling with precisely that same threat.  No matter how many attacks they thwart, others are coming. They are stretched. Man power is below what is required. To put one person under   surveillance consumes resources    20 trained professionals to monitor that one suspect.  Across Europe several thousand young men and women have made their way to join ISIS in Iraq and Syria.  Jihadi threat, The lessons learned there from the past two decades of terror camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan form the basis of an ISIS fighter’s training. The alliances forged between jihadists become trusted international networks when they return home. Be it Britain, Belgium, France, Germany, Denmark, to name but a few, all are barely gripping the new jihadi threat.  A task made much harder by those Islamist extremists who never move and silently aspire to the terror group’s nihilistic ideology. These lone wolves are often far more difficult to find and control. Nowhere in Europe, perhaps with the exception of Britain and the IRA and possibly Spain and ETA (a Basque separatist group) has a threat of this scale manifested since the Normandy landings. The problem reaches far beyond security. It has permeated our politics    and that complicates the response. Immigration in EU under fire, Who remembers what came first: the bomb or the migrant? It barely matters, fears of both and the promise of more cloud even the clearest of minds. In offering homes to Syrian refugees, Angela Merkel was lauded for her moral certainty then lambasted for opening Germany’s doors to trouble. In the past week that fear materialized in the shape of random attacks has arrived in spades. Not as deadly as in France but just as politically corrosive. Nationalists from Scandinavia to Sicily see each tragic event as a step on their own rise to respectability. Validation their scare mongering was right    that migrants and outsiders are bad    the reason they believe their own divisive views should be heard and supported. These   politicians urge repression, regression disguised as a vision that strikes back. A   factor to take away today’s hurt at the expense of piling on pain later. We don’t have to go back much before Normandy to know what that looks like. The struggle to tackle the threat is slower than might be imagined.  Merkel and her French counterpart President Francois Hollande    never mind Britain and Belgium    have different views on Europe.  The pair don’t see eye to eye on migrants and refugees, and yet must, to tackle the growing ISIS menace find common ground beyond security. Counter Terrorism cooperation can be a beginning, but is not an end in itself.  A coordinated approach must take shape or risk dividing Europe.  Pope: World is at war, but it’s not a religious one, The solution lies beyond borders, And therein lies the rub. Finding a way for these EU nations to comprehensively tackle a mutual threat. A threat that sees no international borders, no difference between Paris and Brussels, Copenhagen and Berlin. Nationalism and isolationism won’t be the answer. That road leads to division and cycles of destruction. We’ve traveled that route before. As ISIS loses ground at home, they are upping their rhetoric to reach ”soldiers” with the same misguided ideals overseas. The slaughtering of Christian clergy in their place of worship is evidence of this    a hope of kindling a Christian backlash, and so trigger a war of religions on Europe’s soil. And so we must hold our hate. In the words of Michelle Obama, when talking about U. S. politics, ”as they lower their game so we must raise ours.” This will take collaborative thinking, not just mutually supportive rhetoric. These past weeks it feels no national leader has spoken without pausing first to offer moral support to an EU neighbor grieving a loss to terror. As we tackle the symptoms we must grasp the cause. The problem transcends our borders and so must the solution. At a time of weakness, Europe faces its greatest threats in a generation. Only in unity shall we rise to the challenge. Uncouple our economies if we must but don’t let this terror divide us.  Multiple attacks unsettle Germany "
Trump Halts U.S. Funding of United Nations Population Fund,"President Trump’s administration is ending U. S. funding of the United Nations Population Fund  —   an agency that human rights activists have linked to the support of population control programs such as China’s coercive abortion “  policy. ”[The halt to the funding of the United Nations Population Fund  —   known as UNFPA  —   comes as Trump is scheduled this week to host Chinese President Xi Jinping at the president’s    resort in Florida.  In January, Trump signed an executive order that reinstated the “Mexico City Policy,” which concerns U. S. aid for abortions overseas. The president updated the policy by directing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to implement a plan that expands the policy across all global health assistance funding. The directive means that U. S. taxpayer dollars will no longer be supporting organizations that promote or participate in the management of a coercive abortion program, such as that espoused by China. A report by the Associated Press states that as a result of the end of U. S. funding of UNFPA, $32. 5 million will shift to the U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID) which has the goal of reducing maternal deaths and practices such as genital mutilation. As Breitbart News reported in December 2015, Rep. Chris Smith ( )   of the Congressional Executive Committee on China, observed during a hearing, “The Chinese government is not the only one culpable in these heinous crimes against women and children. The UN Population Fund helped fund birth restrictions, fund forced abortions, and a massive and coercive family planning bureaucracy. ” “The UNFPA whitewashed China’s crimes for decades and continues to do so today,” the congressman continued, adding that on its website UNFPA “justifies its history in China, saying it was ‘tasked by the Executive Committee’ to help China and had to ‘engage with China as a sovereign nation. ’” More than a year ago, China announced that it had switched to a “  policy,” one that Smith said only continues the country’s longstanding attempts to control family life: The “  policy” may possibly become a “  policy” but China’s police state population control policies will not end anytime soon. The Chinese government retains the power to tell couples what their families must look like and the power to punish those who disobey birth quotas. For the past 35 years the Chinese government has wasted precious human potential and sanctioned   violence against women and children —  enabled by   groups globally and the United Nations Population Fund. No one should applaud China’s announced “ ” policy instead we should be insisting they abolish intrusive and abusive birth restrictions forever. Trump’s reinstatement of the Mexico City Policy was criticized in February by Bill and Melinda Gates, whose foundation has as its focus the support of family planning across the globe.  The Gates Foundation is also criticizing Trump’s foreign aid cuts: Foreign aid and access to contraceptives can be smart investments in a more stable and prosperous future. https:  .   —   Gates Foundation (@gatesfoundation) April 3, 2017,  “We’re concerned that this shift could impact millions of women and girls around the world,” Melinda Gates told the Guardian. “It’s likely to have a negative effect on a broad range of health programs that provide lifesaving treatment and prevention options to those most in need”: In Indonesia, I saw more proof that when we invest in contraceptives, we invest in a more stable  prosperous future https:  .   —   Melinda Gates (@melindagates) April 2, 2017, "
EXCLUSIVE: Former Secret Service Agent Warns Trump ‘Not Secure’ in the White House - Breitbart,"A former Secret Service agent who served in the security details of both Presidents Bush and Obama warned on Saturday that President Donald Trump “is not secure in the White House right now as it stands. ”[Dan Bongino, who was also an instructor at the training academy of the Secret Service, was commenting on Friday night’s reported breach of the White House complex, at least the seventh such incident in recent years.  Bongino stated: “If one guy with a backpack and Omar Gonzales with a bad knee could get near the residence of the White House, can you tell me with a straight face that a   tactical assault team with heavy weapons wouldn’t take that place down?” Bongino was referring to a 2014 incident in which Gonzales penetrated the north portico doors of the White House, reportedly brandishing a      folding knife in a back pocket. “This is inexcusable,” Bongino said of the latest incident. “How many of these are we, as the citizenry, going to tolerate, whether under Barack Obama or now President Trump, before there is enough citizen outrage that the Secret Service actually does something?” Bongino is the author of the bestselling 2013 book Life Inside the Bubble: Why a   Secret Service Agent Walked Away from It All. He also previously ran as a Republican for Congress and the Senate. He was speaking in an interview set to air Sunday on this reporter’s talk radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia. “The secret service is not ready right now to defend the White House,” he charged. “They’re not. I know that may make people uncomfortable. And frankly, Aaron, I am really getting tired of some of the talking heads on cable news who have never done one minute in the shoes a secret service agent. ” “They have no idea what the security plan of the White House actually looks like on the ground. They’re all sitting here brushing it under the rug, going, ‘Oh no.’ ‘They were prepared.’ ‘This was a manageable incident.’ ‘This was how it was supposed to work.’ You really believe this is how it was supposed to work?” Regarding Friday night’s breach, Bongino warned, “Do you think that what happened today is not being beamed into every terrorists’ head, going, ‘Look at this fellows.’ I am sounding the alarm hoping and praying with fingers crossed that somebody wakes up and finally does what needs to be done. ” Bongino offered some security upgrade suggestions: “They need to fix the fence. Reinforce the manpower on the north and the south grounds. Add special weapons teams. Get the best technology in there right now. Clearly the technology sensors and cameras are not working as planned. Get them in there yesterday. There’s no other solution. ” Bongino outlined what he says are three major problems facing the Secret Service and the White House security plan. Problem number one, according to Bongino, involves staffing: They have had a brain drain of catastrophic portions in the Secret Service. They lost some of the best agents. If this wasn’t a public radio show that people could hear, I could tell you the names of ten or twenty   tier one guys who left the president’s detail just in the last 5 years who I still communicate with  …     They have had an even worse brain drain in the uniformed division side. They are responsible for the perimeter of the White House.   …    You can’t run a security agency without security officers who know what they’re doing. You just can’t. Problem number two, Bongino contended, is a lack of political will to address the purported security flaws: The management of the Secret Service right now is grossly unprepared for the evolving threats. Grossly. They say they are but they have no political will because a lot of them are out there  —   not all  —   but a lot are looking for their next consulting job. They are just praying that nothing happens on their next watch. They don’t want to be the ones to go on Capitol Hill to say this whole security plan around the White House needs to be fixed. And problem number three involves the actual security plan, he says: They are way too concerned right now, the management, with the optics of White House security. That we can’t make this look like an armed camp. The prior staff didn’t like that. There other entities around the White House that want to preserve the historic look of it. But do you want a secure White House grounds or do you want it to look pretty? CNN reported on Friday night’s breach: A man carrying a backpack was arrested Friday night after breaching security at the White House complex and was discovered by a Secret Service officer by the south entrance to the executive residence, officials said. The incident happened just before midnight while President Donald Trump was at the White House. The suspect, who had a California driver’s license, told Secret Service officers that he was there to see the president.

"Newborn abducted from hospital found alive 18 years later, sheriff says"," (CNN) For most of her life, the young woman born Kamiyah Mobley has lived under another name. A neighbor in Walterboro, South Carolina, described her as a typical    who resided with the woman she long believed to be her mother.   Mobley and the woman often got their nails done together, according to the neighbor, who asked not to be identified. The teenager graduated from high school and had a steady boyfriend.  But DNA tests this week revealed that Mobley was abducted from a Florida hospital in July 1998 by a woman posing as a nurse, Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said Friday. Law enforcement has not released the name she has been living under. She was found this week in South Carolina, where authorities arrested Gloria Williams, 51. Williams was charged with kidnapping and interference with custody, authorities said. She allegedly used fraudulent documents to establish a new identity for Mobley. Williams’ neighbor described her as social worker who always provided for her daughter.  Williams is now facing extradition to Florida, where on a summer day nearly two decades ago she allegedly posed as a nurse and abducted an   baby girl wrapped in a pink and blue blanket.  Investigators are talking to Williams’ extended family in hopes of learning more. It’s unclear whether Williams has an attorney.  Mobley, meanwhile, attempts to deal with the new revelations of her life. Video showed her weeping and hugging Gloria Williams inside the Colleton County Detention Center in Walterboro. The Jacksonville sheriff said the young woman ”had an inclination beginning a couple of months ago” that she may have been abducted.  ”She’s taking it as well as you can imagine,” he said. ”She has a lot to process. She has a lot to think about.”  Mobley was located after a series of tips late last year to the National Center for Missing  Exploited Children, according to the sheriff. The FBI assisted in the investigation. ”I don’t know what she is going through, but I feel for her,” the South Carolina neighbor said of Mobley. In Jacksonville, about 175 miles south of where Mobley was found, her biological parents and grandmother were ”extremely excited and overwhelmed with emotion” at the news, the sheriff said.  Mobley seems to be in good health, he said.  ’Please bring my baby back’ On July 10, 1998    the day Mobley disappeared    a kidnapper dressed as a nurse and, wearing a blue smock with flowers and surgical gloves, was captured in grainy surveillance video at the hospital.  Mobley’s mother, Shanara, who was 16 at the time, told investigators that a woman dressed as a nurse entered her hospital room.  ”The suspect remained in the room with the victim and continued helping her and talking with her,” said the incident report filed with the sheriff’s office.  The mother asked the woman to place her daughter in a baby carrier but she instead left the room with the child, according to the report.      Shanara Mobley believed the woman was a hospital employee, CNN affiliate   in Jacksonville reported. Hospital staff believed the woman was a relative of the Mobleys. ”Please bring my baby back,” Shanara Mobley cried during an interview with WJXT at the time. ”If you were faking a pregnancy or you just can’t have no kids, how do you think I feel. .. That’s my first child.” Sitting in a room with an empty bassinet and unopened baby toys, the mother added, ”That would be the happiest thing in the world for me . .. to hold my baby and know she’s not going nowhere else.” Tips rolled in over the years, The abduction made national headlines. Authorities searched the hospital and surrounding areas. Helicopters were brought in and roadblocks were set up. Hospitals in Jacksonville and beyond increased security in maternity wards, WJXT reported.  Shanara Mobley was awarded $1. 5 million after settling a lawsuit against the former University Medical Center, the station reported. She has since had three other children.  Over the years, authorities received more than 2, 500 tips in connection with the case. A sample of Mobley’s DNA taken at the time of her birth was matched Thursday with a swab taken from the young woman earlier this week.   On Friday, investigators were calling retired detectives who worked on the case with word of the latest development.  ”This is a case like we have not seen in this country in a long time,” the sheriff said.  So far, there is no word about a possible reunion between Mobley and her biological mother.  ”It’s up to Kamiyah,” Sheriff Williams said. ”She’s an adult.”"
"Halloween, Instagram Style - The New York Times","Last night Eleven from “Stranger Things” and the Snapchat deer filter may have dominated the Halloween streets, but at parties beforehand a number of celebrities went their own way. Following, our survey of the most creative costumes. Beyoncé and Blue Ivy Carter have worn   costumes for the last three years, but this time, they invited Grandma to join their    cover band. The former Destiny’s Child member also looked to the ’90s for costume inspiration, dressing as Dionne from “Clueless. ” The fashion designer took on the form of a female bodybuilder named Stacie while his boyfriend Charlie Defrancesco played his fitness counterpart, Larry, at Bette Midler’s Halloween party. Another throwback costume came in the form of Christina Aguilera’s 2002 “Dirrty” music video look, replicated all the way down to the crotchless pants. Kim Kardashian is on a social media hiatus. Her sister, on the other hand, posted plenty of photos of her   couple costume, Storm and Black Panther. Ms. Alba and her friend Kelly Sawyer dressed as Edina and Patsy of “Absolutely Fabulous”  —   Champagne included. Ryan Lochte’s silver Olympic hair, among his other Rio 2016 antics, made the swimmer a star of the Halloween costume rotation, with Mr. Lautner, Nina Dobrev and more assuming his guise. Katy Perry, who sang at the Democratic convention this summer, attended a Halloween party dressed as Hillary Clinton, accompanied by Michael Kives as Bill Clinton. Ms. Perry’s boyfriend, Orlando Bloom, followed behind as Donald Trump. Ms. Schumer’s boyfriend was one of many Elevens, while the comedian costumed herself as another “Stranger Things” character: Dustin. The lifestyle expert Instagrammed a photo of J.

Former Trump Advisor: Paul Ryan Should Step Down If He Cannot Pass Obamacare Repeal - Breitbart,"Betsy McCaughey, a former Donald Trump economic advisor, said that Speaker Ryan should step down if he cannot pass an Obamacare repeal package. [Speaking to radio host John Castimatidis on AM 970 in New York, McCaughey said, “If he can’t do his job as Speaker, to hold these Republicans together and get a repeal and replace bill through, somebody else should be Speaker. ”  Betsy McCaughey, the former lieutenant governor of New York, said that “Obamacare is in a death spiral,” and accused Speaker Ryan of pushing for “ . ” McCaughey is not the first Republican to oppose the Ryan plan to replace Obamacare. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows ( ) said that the Ryan plan’s refundable tax credits could amount to a new “entitlement program. ” Congressman Pete Sessions ( ) has said that taxing expensive   health insurance plans creates a new “Cadillac tax. ” The former Trump economic advisor said that Speaker Ryan is not in line with Trump’s agenda. She said, “Ryan has attached things to his version of the replacement bill that are very unpopular. He’s got to get on board with Donald Trump, because Donald Trump’s program is popular. ” McCaughey argued that limiting the tax deductibility of health coverage raise taxes on half of America.

James Comey’s Opening Remarks: It’s All About Him - Breitbart,"Former FBI director James Comey opened his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday by complaining about “shifting explanations” for why he had been fired, and by attacking the Trump administration. [Comey said that he had originally intended to accept his firing quietly, but then found that the administration’s statements about the matter “confused me and increasingly concerned me. ” He said that President Donald Trump had assured him that he was doing a good job, and that he had assured the president in return that he intended to stay.  “I was extremely   by the FBI workforce,” Comey said. “So it confused me when I saw on television the president saying that he actually fired me because of the Russia investigation. ” Under questioning, Comey would later admit that the president did not ask him to stop the Russia investigation, an admission already contained in Comey’s prepared written testimony. Comey continued: “I was also confused by the initial explanation that was offered publicly: that I was fired because of the decisions I had made during the election year. ” He had assumed that was “water   …     under the bridge,” he said. “The administration then chose to defame me, and more importantly the FBI, by saying that the organization was in disarray, that it was poorly led, that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader. Those were lies, plain and simple, and I am so sorry that the FBI workforce had to hear them, and I’m so sorry that the American people were told them. ” Comey closed his remarks by offering words of praise for his former colleagues at the FBI. But his remarks left little doubt that his motivations for testifying were deeply personal. And they created an impression that he intended to exact a political price from the president for doing what he acknowledged the president had every right to do. Joel B.

"As Wind Power Lifts Wyoming’s Fortunes, Coal Miners Are Left in the Dust - The New York Times","GILLETTE, Wyo.  —   After Kullin Orcutt lost his job at the Peabody coal mine this spring, he knew what he needed to do: join the exodus. “Leave Gillette, leave the state,” he said. Mr. Orcutt is a   miner and one of 592 coal workers who have been laid off here since January. Thousands more job cuts are expected this summer. More people will follow Mr. Orcutt. While many businesses in Gillette are struggling to stay open, a   dealer has been nearly sold out since the school year ended this month. But 200 miles to the southwest, in Carbon County, where Wyoming’s first coal mine opened a century ago, the mood is different. The last coal mine closed a decade ago, but the county may soon be home to the largest wind farm in North America, if not the world. “Coal is hurting, but wind power is our bright spot on the horizon,” said Cindy Wallace, the director of the Carbon County Economic Development Corporation. “Eventually, we could be the wind capital of Wyoming, the U. S. the world. ” In Wyoming, the country’s biggest   state, the energy landscape is transforming along with the nation’s, but in a state of 584, 000 people, that change is happening at hyperspeed. That transition has left men like Mr. Orcutt behind. The new positions and financial opportunities offered by wind and other   industries are not replacing all the jobs going up in coal smoke. Many of the current jobs are out of state, at wind turbine factories in Colorado and Iowa. Millions of dollars’ worth of    investments are flowing into Wyoming’s wind projects, but much of the profit will flow out of state, as well. The thousands of coal workers who will probably lose their jobs do not necessarily have the technical skills to operate wind farms. In any case, new wind jobs will number in the hundreds, not the thousands. So when Mr. Orcutt left Gillette this spring, he did not head for the wind fields of Carbon County. Instead, he moved to Shelby, Mont. for a job at a privately run prison, leaving behind his wife and son in a groaning   apartment that they share with Mr. Orcutt’s sister, her husband  —   a welder who was laid off from the coal mines  —   and that couple’s three children. “It’s hard being here without them, but here I have a job,” he said. “In Gillette, those jobs are gone forever. ” The numbers bear out his decision, said Robert W. Godby, an energy economist and professor at the University of Wyoming. “Wind energy is certainly lucrative,” he said. “That’s why so many investors are interested. But it doesn’t create nearly the economic impact of the fossil fuel industry. ” Today, about 66 percent of the electricity in the United States is produced by coal and natural gas, and just 7 percent is produced by renewable sources such as wind and solar. But market forces and government regulations are rapidly changing that picture. A glut of inexpensive natural gas has cut into coal’s dominance of America’s power market. And President Obama’s climate change regulations, known as the Clean Power Plan, take direct aim at coal, the No. 1 cause of   greenhouse gases. The Department of the Interior has already declared a halt on new coal mining on public lands, a move with an outsize impact on Wyoming, where a majority of mines are on federal property. And the international Paris agreement on climate change could make the efforts to end the burning of coal a global campaign. All of these policies are closing the remaining   plants and freezing the construction of new ones, but they also aim to aggressively increase the production of renewable power. The Clean Power Plan contains a goal for 20 percent of the nation’s electricity to come from wind, solar and other clean sources by 2030. Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has pledged to raise that amount to 33 percent by 2027. Companies from around the world are looking to Wyoming’s wind to meet that demand. “There’s enough wind in Wyoming to power the entire country,” said Michael Goggin, the senior director of research at the American Wind Energy Association. Wyoming’s Republican governor, Matt Mead, is skeptical of   climate change, and has been an outspoken opponent of Mr. Obama’s climate change agenda. Still, he also sees economic opportunity in  wind power. “We’ve been a    state, exporting energy to the rest of the country,” Mr. Mead said in an interview in his office. “With the advances in wind turbines, why shouldn’t we be leading that at the University of Wyoming? Why don’t we do more to bring wind manufacturing to the state?” Perhaps the biggest winner in Wyoming’s wind boom will be one man: Philip F. Anschutz, a Colorado billionaire and major Republican donor. His company, the Anschutz Corporation, is building the Carbon County wind farm on 2, 000 acres owned by Mr. Anschutz and the federal government. When completed, the site will be the largest wind power producer in North America, generating enough electricity to light a million homes  —   far more than Wyoming needs. Mr. Anschutz is also planning to build the TransWest Express, a   power line that would take Wyoming’s wind energy to Las Vegas and California. Construction on both projects is expected to begin late this year or early 2017. On a recent day, Bill Miller, senior vice president of energy and land resources for the Anschutz Corporation, drove his truck through the Carbon County site’s rocky mesas, which channel   wind across the green plain. The only visible inhabitants were cows, antelopes, prairie dogs and rattlesnakes. Although wind power has traditionally been more expensive than fossil fuels, Mr. Miller said the Anschutz wind project will be large enough to make wind as cheap, if not cheaper, than coal power. “We can produce wind power here that’s competitive with anything: coal, natural gas,” Mr. Miller said. Mr. Miller estimates that the construction of the wind farm will create about 900 seasonal jobs over the decade it will take to build it, and about 150   jobs to operate and maintain it. In the nearby town of Rawlins, he said, a branch of Western Wyoming Community College has already started programs to train wind power technicians. “You’ll be able to take a coal miner from Gillette  —   he can go to the community college here for the skills, and get a job as a wind technician,” Mr. Miller said. But, he conceded, “Am I going to replace 800 lost coal jobs in Gillette with new wind jobs? No. ” Another big winner in the Wyoming wind boom may be a Venezuelan company, Viridis Eolia Corporation, which also plans to build a   wind farm near Carbon County, one second in size in North America only to the Anschutz project. “It’s the wave of the future,” Juan Carlos Carpio Delfino, Viridis Eolia’s chief executive, said at an energy conference at Little America, a golf resort outside Cheyenne. “With Obama’s clean power regulations, and the signing of the Paris agreement, it creates a stable market for wind  —   and this is the best wind in North America. ” That remains cold comfort to Wyoming’s coal community. Mr. Godby estimates that in the coming years, Wyoming could lose up to 10, 000 jobs related to the coal industry. Last month, officials from the Interior Department held a public hearing in Casper to gather input on the current halt on new coal mining on the state’s public lands. During the meeting, Jillian Balow, the Wyoming superintendent of public instruction, spoke before a crowd of hundreds, her voice cracking. “We have reached the point where the restrictions and regulations for the industry are past our ability to adapt,” she said. “It has put thousands of   people out of work and is devastating families. ” “Give us a chance,” she pleaded."
GOP House Majority Whip Scalise on Forgoing August Recess: ’We Are Just Going to Stay in and Get It Done’ - Breitbart,"On Sunday’s broadcast of Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures,” host Maria Bartiromo confronted House Majority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise ( ) about the approaching deadline for Congress to pass legislation on health care and tax reform.  Bartiromo asked Scalise about the possibility of Congress forgoing its August recess to get those bills through. Scalise at first said he believed deadlines would force people to come to the table, but added they would stay in and get it done when asked about “not taking a vacation. ” Watch: Partial transcript as follows: BARTIROMO: You got to admit, the American people are just outraged by the calendar in terms of Congress. I mean, you have got  —   what, 38 days left or less in terms of actually working. How is it possible that you guys have the entire month of August off? Is it possible that if you don’t get tax reform done that you will forgo your August recess and you’ll keep working until you get this done? SCALISE: Well, I have always been somebody that says you get your work done while you are there. There are deadlines for a reason. It forces people to come to the table. You know, we have no working on healthcare and tax cuts for months now. And ultimately you need those deadlines to force the folks that are still not there yet  —   BARTIROMO: So you’ll get it done? SCALISE:  —   to focus and get the job done. We have to get it done. We have to pass health care reform, and we’ve got to cut taxes and simplify the code. Imagine if you can actually do your tax returns on a postcard. BARTIROMO: Yeah. SCALISE: Over 90 percent of Americans will get that with our bill. And you cut tax rates for everybody and repeal  —   (CROSSTALK) BARTIROMO: And if you don’t will you not take vacation? SCALISE: We are just going to stay in and get it done, Maria. That is a thing. You know, we’re going to get the job done. We have to for the American people. And this economy is waiting. There is so much demand that is  . Let’s get it done.

"Meryl Streep Hits Trump Again, Vows to Fight ’Brownshirts’ in Gala Speech","Meryl Streep continued her criticism of President Donald Trump, defended her   Golden Globes acceptance speech and vowed to “stand up” against “brownshirts” and “trolls” during her acceptance speech Saturday night at the Human Rights Campaign’s annual New York City dinner gala. [In a   speech, while accepting the National Ally for Equality Award at the dinner, the      actress lamented that “fundamentalists of every stripe” are seeking to undo the United States’ progress on civil rights and dedicated her honor to her gay and transgender teachers, mentors and colleagues.  At the outset, Streep defended her acceptance speech from January’s Golden Globes, in which she implied that professional football and mixed martial arts do not count as “the arts. ” “First of all, I do like football. Let me just make that clear. I gave seven years, seven of my youngest, prettiest years to being a cheerleader for football, basketball, and wrestling,” Streep said, according to a transcript provided by the Hollywood Reporter. “If you overhear a woman in a restaurant say, ‘My son is very interested in the arts,’ she probably doesn’t mean football or mixed martial arts. ” “They are just not the same thing,” she added. ” Look, some of us like football, some of us like the arts, many of us require both in our lives. I was making a joke. Some people missed it. ” Streep went on to discuss the impact that two of her teachers had on her while she was growing up in   New Jersey her transgender elementary school music teacher, Paul Grossman, and her gay piano teacher George Vauss. “I am not going to introduce you to all my gay teachers,” she explained, “just some of the most influential personalities in my past, the memorable people who made me an artist and who lived, unnecessarily, under duress. ” The actress  —   who earned her 20th Oscar nomination this year for her role in Florence Foster Jenkins  —   continued by describing the   cultures of the past 40, 000 years before saying that sometime in the 20th century, “the clouds parted. ” “Something changed. For the first time in 39, 999 years, women began to be regarded as, if not equal, at least deserving of equal rights,” Streep said. “Men and women of color demanded their equal rights. People of sexual orientation and gender identification outside the status quo also demanded equal regard under the law. So did people with disabilities. We all won rights that had already been granted us, in theory, in our Constitution two centuries before but the courts and society finally caught up and recognized our claims. ” Then, without mentioning him by name, Streep launched into a tirade against President Trump. The actress said: “If we live through this precarious moment, if his catastrophic instinct to retaliate doesn’t lead us to nuclear winter, we will have much to thank our current leader for. He will have woken us up to how fragile freedom is. His whisperers will have alerted us to potential flaws in the balance of power in government. To how we have relied on the goodwill and selflessness of most previous occupants of the Oval Office. How quaint notions of custom, honor and duty compelled them to adhere to certain practices of transparency and responsibility. To how it all can be ignored. How the authority of the executive, in the hands of a   can be wielded against the people, their Constitution and Bill of Rights. The whip of the executive, through a Twitter feed, can lash and intimidate, punish and humiliate, delegitimize the press and imagined enemies with spasmodic regularity and easily provoked predictability. ” In closing, Streep said that she felt compelled to “stand up” and “act up” in the face of “troll attacks” and “armies of brownshirts,” even though she would prefer not to do so. “It’s hard to stand up. I don’t want to do it. I want to read and garden and load the dishwasher. It’s embarrassing and terrifying to put the target on your forehead,” she said. “And it sets you up for troll attacks and armies of brownshirts and bots and worse, and the only way you can do it is if you feel you have to. You have to. You have no choice, but you have to speak up and stand up and act up. ” Read Streep’s full acceptance speech at the Hollywood Reporter.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum"
Pigeons Resist Misguided Leaders - The New York Times,"When the leader of a flock goes the wrong way, what will the flock do? With human beings, nobody can be sure. But with homing pigeons, the answer is that they find their way home anyway. Either the lead pigeon recognizes that it has no clue and falls back into the flock, letting birds that know where they are going take over, or the flock collectively decides that the direction that it is taking just doesn’t feel right, and it doesn’t follow. Several European scientists report these findings in a stirring report in Biology Letters titled, “Misinformed Leaders Lose Influence Over Pigeon Flocks. ” Isobel Watts, a doctoral student in zoology at Oxford, conducted the study with her advisers, Theresa Burt de Perera and Dora Biro, and with the participation of Mate Nagy, a statistical physicist from Hungary, who is affiliated with several institutions, including Oxford and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Dr. Biro, who studies social behavior in primates as well as pigeons, said that the common questions that ran through her work were “about group living and what types of challenges and opportunities it brings. ” She and her colleagues at Oxford have pioneered a method of studying flock behavior that uses    GPS units, which the birds wear in   backpacks. The devices record a detailed position for each bird a number of times a second. Researchers in Budapest and Oxford developed software to analyze small movements and responses of every bird in a flock. With this method, the scientists can identify which pigeons are leading the way. They can build a picture of how each bird responds to changes in the flight of other birds. The consistent leaders were often fast fliers and occupied the first position in the group of flying birds. Other birds followed them. But what if one day, a leader flew in the wrong direction? The researchers arranged to feed the leaders misinformation by putting them in lofts with artificial light for a few days. By shifting when the lights went on and off, compared with the actual external schedule of light and dark, the researchers could shift the pigeons’ internal clocks a few hours forward or back. Pigeons navigate by using the position of the sun and an internal clock, so the change in the clock threw off their sense of direction and they didn’t fly toward home at all. But the pigeon flock corrected its flight path, and went the right way. Dr. Biro doesn’t know exactly how they corrected. The followers all had the right information, so they might have collectively said, “this guy’s wrong, let’s not follow him,” Dr. Biro said. “Or, the leader said, ‘Something’s wrong here,’” and fell back into the flock, “effectively choosing not to lead,” Dr. Biro said, and another pigeon, that knew the time of day, led the way. Sadly, these kinds of decisions by pigeon flocks offer no reassurance to humans who think political leaders are misinformed or misdirected. The pigeons don’t communicate directly about where they are flying. The flock changes its flight path because of   reactions to position changes by other birds. There’s no   process remotely similar to, say, an election. But knowledge of how the pigeons work might be useful in creating swarms of small robots for activities like search and rescue. If researchers can reduce the   process of a flock to a few simple rules about who follows whom, and when, those rules might be applied to robot groups. Then the group of robots might be able to make some of its own decisions, at least about where to go or how to get there."

Prison time for some Atlanta school educators in cheating scandal," (CNN) There was nothing routine about a sentencing hearing Tuesday in Atlanta that wrote the final legal chapter of one of the most massive school cheating scandals in the country.    Educators were convicted April 1 of racketeering and other lesser crimes related to inflating test scores of children from struggling schools. One teacher was acquitted. One by one, they stood, alongside their attorneys, before Fulton County Superior Court Judge Jerry Baxter. In this system, a jury decides guilt or innocence, the judge metes out punishment. Throughout the   trial, Baxter has been pointed. Until Monday, he said he planned to sentence the educators to prison. When verdicts were reached, he ordered them directly to jail.  But on Monday he changed his mind and decided to allow prosecutors to offer them deals that would have allowed them to avoid the possible   sentence that racketeering carries.  And that’s why there were sparks when some of the educators, flanked by their attorneys, did not directly and readily admit their responsibility.  Baxter was not pleased. He raised his voice numerous times and shouted at attorneys. Some attorneys shouted back. At one point, one of the defense lawyers said he might move to recuse the judge and the judge retorted that he could send that attorney to jail. ”Everybody starts crying about these educators. This was not a victimless crime that occurred in this city!” Baxter said. ’Search your soul’ ”Everybody knew cheating was going on and your client promoted it,” Baxter said to an attorney representing Atlanta Public Schools educator Sharon   who Baxter sentenced to seven years in prison.    was ordered to perform 2, 000 hours of community service and pay a $25, 000 fine. Repeatedly, Baxter appeared frustrated when more educators did not simply accept the deal and plainly vocalize their guilt.  ”These stories are incredible. These kids can’t read,” he said.  ”This is the time to search your soul,” Baxter said. ”It’s just taking responsibility. . .. No one has taken responsibility that I can see.” In 2013, a Fulton County grand jury indicted 35 educators from the Atlanta Public Schools district, and more than 20 took a plea deal. Among them were teachers, principals and testing coordinators.  The cheating is believed to date back to 2001, when scores on statewide aptitude tests improved greatly, according to a 2013 indictment. The indictment also states that for at least four years, between 2005 and 2009, test answers were altered, fabricated or falsely certified.  A review that former Gov. Sonny Perdue ordered, determined that some cheating had occurred in more than half the district’s elementary and middle schools.  Michael Bowers, a former Georgia attorney general who investigated the cheating scandal, said in 2013 that there were ”cheating parties,” erasures in and out of classrooms, and teachers were told to make changes to student answers on tests. ”Anything that you can imagine that could involve cheating    it was done,” he said at the time. During his investigation, he heard that educators cheated out of pride, to earn bonuses, to enhance their careers or to keep their jobs, he said. The cheating allegedly involved the top educator in the district,   Public Schools Superintendent Beverly Hall.  Hall said she was innocent. Suffering from cancer, she died before she could stand trial.  The sentences, The Atlanta  ’s investigative journalism is credited with first examining the corruption within the city’s public school system. On Tuesday, the newspaper published photos of each of those who took plea deals and the sentences they received.  * Donald Bullock was first. Witnesses testified that Bullock urged them to change test answers, The Atlanta   reported. The former testing coordinator was ordered to serve five years probation, six months of weekends behind bars, pay a $5, 000 fine and perform 1, 500 hours of community service. As part of his deal, Bullock agreed to waive his right to appeal.  * Angela Williamson, a former teacher, was ordered to serve two years in prison. She was ordered to pay a $5, 000 fine and perform 1, 500 hours of community service.  * Pamela Cleveland, a former teacher, was ordered to serve one year home confinement, pay a $1, 000 fine and perform 1, 000 hours of community service. ”I am guilty of the charges against me,” Cleveland said in court. * Michael Pitts, a former schools executive, was accused of telling teachers to cheat and then telling them not to talk to Georgia Bureau of Investigators who were looking into the scandal. He was ordered to serve seven years in prison, perform 2, 000 hours of community service and pay a $25, 000 fine.  * Tamara Cotman, a former schools administrator, was ordered to serve seven years in prison, pay a $25, 000 fine and perform 2000 hours of community service. * Dana Evans, a former principal, was ordered to serve one year and perform 1, 000 hours of community service. *Tabeeka Jordan, former assistant principal, was ordered to serve two years in prison, perform 1, 500 hours of community service and pay $5, 000 fine, * Theresia Copeland, a former test coordinator, was ordered to serve one year in prison,  perform 1, 000 hours of community service and pay a $1, 000 fine. * Diane   a former teacher, was ordered to serve one year in prison,  perform 1, 000 hours of community service and pay a $1, 000 fine.

Report: Kanye Had ’Massive Meltdown’ After Fashion Show Flop,"Rapper Kanye West reportedly had a “massive meltdown” and fired his entire staff following the   Yeezy Season 4 fashion show debacle last month, which has been variously described as “hell on earth” and a “shameful and horrible” display of “cruelty” toward the models. [“He had his agent fire all 30 of his staff after the fashion show and got rid of his phone so people can only contact him via ” an unnamed insider told the New York Post’s Page Six. “He had a nervous breakdown after the show and that’s what triggered it all. ”  The Life of Pablo rapper’s New York Fashion Week show was rife with problems, from reports of models falling faint from heat exhaustion to other models throwing off their shoes in fits of rage.

He was reflective and disappointed in how things went,” the source continued. “He took stock in what people were saying and he was disappointed.

Kevin Turner’s Parents Still Watch Football. But Differently. - The New York Times,"HOLTVILLE, Ala.  —   In an airy,   house here on Jordan Lake about 25 miles north of Montgomery and around the corner from cotton farms, there is a     television on the living room wall. The TV belongs to Myra and Raymond Turner, the parents of Kevin Turner, a former Alabama fullback who played eight seasons in the N. F. L. This Sunday, that TV will be tuned to the N. F. L. playoffs, to the game that killed their son. “I know a lot of people are going to say, ‘How do you watch football knowing football had taken your son’s own life? ’” Raymond Turner said. “But it’s hard to explain, really. It’s just all so hard to explain. ” I traveled to Alabama to hear an explanation and try to understand it  —   and maybe even understand why they allow their two teenage grandsons to play football after Kevin, the boys’ father, suffered for six long years with a brain disease that research has linked to head trauma in football. He died last March at 46. There was no clear answer to my question, only compartmentalized memories. In the house on the lake, which Kevin helped his parents buy, reminders of him appear at every turn. On the desk in his old bedroom is one of his Alabama playbooks in the rec room are seven of his jerseys, framed in the living room, there is his Philadelphia Eagles helmet and, of course, the giant   TV, which used to be his. Kevin, who played for the New England Patriots as well as the Eagles, died after being treated for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as A. L. S. and Lou Gehrig’s disease. Kevin donated his brain to researchers in Boston who have examined the brains of more than 200 former football players after they died. The researchers said Kevin Turner’s brain was “riddled” with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C. T. E. which has been tied to repeated blows to the head. When watching Sunday’s playoff games, you probably won’t think about Turner. But you should. In a life that was shortened by football, he made a wide and lasting impact on the sport. After the diagnosis in 2010, Turner became one of the main plaintiffs in a   lawsuit former players brought against the N. F. L. claiming that the league hid the   cognitive dangers of the game. The league agreed to a settlement for potentially hundreds of millions of dollars, and the first payouts from that litigation are expected in the coming months. Turner didn’t live to see a penny of that settlement money. The cash could have helped him when his body deteriorated and his family had to care for him. The Turners remember their son, who once weighed 235 pounds, dwindling to 100. At first, he lost strength in his left hand. And his left arm. Then his right arm and hand. Then his neck. His mother had to learn how to thicken water so he wouldn’t choke while drinking it, and how to clean his breathing and feeding tubes. By the end, Kevin couldn’t eat, drink, swallow or talk, as he fought for each breath. “It’s all been really hard,” Myra said, as she started to cry. “It’s worse than you can imagine, having to be a nurse to your son and then losing your only son. ” With the family’s cooperation, HBO’s “Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel” has chronicled the six years of Kevin’s decline for a segment that will be televised on Tuesday. His parents think it is important to tell their story, to raise awareness about C. T. E. They take no offense at questions about why they haven’t turned their backs on football. They still watch. They just watch differently. They pay a lot more attention to college games than to the N. F. L. and they are always interested in seeing how officials treat a player who might have a concussion. They have tuned into the N. F. L. playoffs, and they plan to watch the Super Bowl. Neither is ignoring the risk of C. T. E. but Raymond said, “It’s probably too late for those guys in the N. F. L. ” As Myra Turner watched the Dallas Cowboys play the Packers last weekend, she saw a TV camera stop on the former Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith, who was celebrating and grabbing his seatmate, Tony Dorsett, another Cowboys alumnus. Dorsett, who has said he has memory loss and other signs of C. T. E. didn’t look right. “He didn’t even crack a smile,” Myra said. “He was just sitting there and I thought, ‘Wow, how can he sit there with no emotion at all?’ Then I realized, oh, yeah, I do know why. ’” The Turners grew up in this state, where football is king, a rite passed from fathers to sons. Raymond played, then coached Kevin. “I’m a guy, so I love football  —   the hitting, the running, the scoring, the girls,” Raymond said, before Myra cut him off. “And I was a cheerleader!” she said. “I was the only girl you’re talking about, right?” By their smiles and giggles, you could tell football once brought them unquestionable joy, long before anyone had heard of C. T. E.  —   or even took concussions seriously. Today, their granddaughter, Natalie, 16, is a cheerleader dating a football player, just as her grandmother did. Myra won’t watch her grandsons play. Raymond watches every game. Nolan was a redshirt freshman at Clemson last season. Cole plays in middle school. “Their dad told them to think long and hard before playing football because of what it could possibly do to their brains,” Raymond said. “But the boys wanted to play. The game is much safer. What can you do? We make sure they are extra careful. ” He said: “If the boys said they didn’t want to play football anymore, I’d be pretty happy about that. But Nolan is 19 and can make his own decisions now. I can’t convince him of anything. ” As the couple talked about their bittersweet relationship with football, Raymond twisted a napkin so many times and so tightly that it became a hard, tiny paper sculpture. Myra’s eyes filled with tears. “I can’t believe my son is gone,” she said. Kevin was buried last Easter in Prattville, Ala. about four miles from his high school football field, which is now named after him. On Thursday, his grave was marked with a small white metal cross and a vase of white artificial flowers, which had fallen onto its side. The squares of sod atop his plot had yet to grow together. His bronze grave marker  —   which will be finished any day now  —   will have his name, Paul Kevin Turner, and two etchings of him in a football uniform  —   one from his days at Alabama, the other from when he was with the Eagles. Between his dates of birth and death, there will be a raised image of a golden football. “I didn’t think twice about putting football on there,” Myra said. “Because that was his life, our life. ”"
Woman Finds Neighbor’s Frozen Mother in $30 Used Freezer,"A North Carolina woman who bought her neighbor’s used standalone freezer thought she got a steal for only $30. But upon opening it, her delight turned to shock when she discovered her neighbor’s mother dead and frozen solid inside. [When a woman from Goldsboro, North Carolina, discovered her neighbor was preparing to move away, the $30 deal for the freezer was struck. She moved the freezer into her home, plugged it in, but left it for three weeks unopened.  When she was finally ready to use the freezer, she was shocked by what she found inside. “My heart was in my throat and I ran outside, called 911,” the neighbor said. The freezer’s new owner said her recently moved neighbor insisted that the unit stay closed for several weeks because inside was a “church project” in the form of a “time capsule” that must stay undisturbed. The   told her that members of a nearby church would come by in a few weeks to open the freezer and remove the “project. ” But when no one came, the woman decided to open the freezer herself to see what was inside. “I had already made the decision that I really needed to open it because everything was just so sketchy,” she added. “And I had even had the idea that maybe her mom was in there. ” “I went in there and I opened it up,” she said. “Lifted the lid and I saw a foot. And I put the lid back down and I tried to analyze what I just saw. And it looked fake so I opened it again and I looked again. But then I recognized the foot. It was her mother’s foot. ” Goldsboro police confirmed that inside the freezer were the remains of the  ’s mother. “She sold me her frozen mother for $30. How do you do something like that?” the buyer told the media. The neighbor’s mother hadn’t been seen since last September, but was   by locals. “(She was) Just the sweetest lady. I mean quiet, kept to herself, stayed at home. Just unbelievable how she could just stick her mom in a freezer,” the woman said. Police have discovered that the   told several different stories to different people about why she was moving away. She has yet to be located. By some accounts, the elderly woman’s body had been dismembered. The remains have been sent to the county medical examiner’s office and an investigation has been launched into the death. The hunt is also on for the dead woman’s daughter. This is far from the first time someone has used a freezer to put a murder on ice. Last year, a Detroit Mother told the media that she was not sorry she tortured and murdered her two children and then hid their tiny bodies in her freezer. She insisted that the murders were in retaliation for the children’s bad behavior. In another case, a Florida woman is being charged for the death of her    daughter, found in the family freezer.

Raid in Yemen: Risky From the Start and Costly in the End - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Just five days after taking office, over dinner with his newly installed secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, President Trump was presented with the first of what will be many    decisions: whether to approve a commando raid that risked the lives of American Special Operations forces and foreign civilians alike. President Barack Obama’s national security aides had reviewed the plans for a risky attack on a small, heavily guarded brick home of a senior Qaeda collaborator in a mountainous village in a remote part of central Yemen. But Mr. Obama did not act because the Pentagon wanted to launch the attack on a moonless night and the next one would come after his term had ended. With two of his closest advisers, Jared Kushner and Stephen K. Bannon, joining the dinner at the White House along with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. Mr. Trump approved sending in the Navy’s SEAL Team 6, hoping the raid early last Sunday would scoop up cellphones and laptop computers that could yield valuable clues about one of the world’s most dangerous terrorist groups. Vice President Mike Pence and Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser, also attended the dinner. As it turned out, almost everything that could go wrong did. And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to be present as the body of the American commando killed in the raid was returned home, the first military death on the new commander in chief’s watch. The death of Chief Petty Officer William Owens came after a chain of mishaps and misjudgments that plunged the elite commandos into a ferocious   firefight that also left three others wounded and a $75 million aircraft deliberately destroyed. There are allegations  —   which the Pentagon acknowledged on Wednesday night are most likely correct  —   that the mission also killed several civilians, including some children. The dead include, by the account of Al Qaeda’s branch in Yemen, the    daughter of Anwar   the   Qaeda leader who was killed in a targeted drone strike in 2011. Mr. Trump on Sunday hailed his first counterterrorism operation as a success, claiming the commandos captured “important intelligence that will assist the U. S. in preventing terrorism against its citizens and people around the world. ” A statement by the military’s Central Command on Wednesday night that acknowledged the likelihood of civilian casualties also said that the recovered materials had provided some initial information helpful to counterterrorism analysts. The statement did not provide details. But the mission’s casualties raise doubts about the months of detailed planning that went into the operation during the Obama administration and whether the right questions were raised before its approval. Typically, the president’s advisers lay out the risks, but Pentagon officials declined to characterize any discussions with Mr. Trump. A senior administration official said on Wednesday night that the Defense Department had conducted a legal review of the operation that Mr. Trump approved and that a Pentagon lawyer had signed off on it. Mr. Trump’s new national security team, led by Mr. Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and a retired general with experience in counterterrorism raids, has said that it wants to speed the   when it comes to such strikes, delegating more power to   officials so that the military may respond more quickly. Indeed, the Pentagon is drafting such plans to accelerate activities against the Qaeda branch in Yemen. But doing that also raises the possibility of error. “You can mitigate risk in missions like this, but you can’t mitigate risk down to zero,” said William Wechsler, a former top counterterrorism official at the Pentagon. In this case, the assault force of several dozen commandos, which also included elite soldiers from the United Arab Emirates, was jinxed from the start. Qaeda fighters were somehow tipped off to the stealthy advance toward the village  —   perhaps by the whine of American drones that local tribal leaders said were flying lower and louder than usual. Through a communications intercept, the commandos knew that the mission had been somehow compromised, but pressed on toward their target roughly five miles from where they had been flown into the area. “They kind of knew they were screwed from the beginning,” one former SEAL Team 6 official said. With the crucial element of surprise lost, the Americans and Emiratis found themselves in a gun battle with Qaeda fighters who took up positions in other houses, a clinic, a school and a mosque, often using women and children as cover, American military officials said in interviews this week. The commandos were taken aback when some of the women grabbed weapons and started firing, multiplying the militant firepower beyond what they had expected. The Americans called in airstrikes from helicopter gunships and fighter aircraft that helped kill some 14 Qaeda fighters, but not before an   Osprey aircraft involved in the operation experienced a “hard landing,” injuring three more American personnel on board. The Osprey, which the Marine Corps said cost $75 million, was badly damaged and had to be destroyed by an airstrike. The raid, some details of which were first reported by The Washington Post, also destroyed much of the village of Yakla, and left senior Yemeni government officials seething. Yemen’s foreign minister, Abdul Malik Al Mekhlafi, condemned the raid on Monday in a post on his official Twitter account as “extrajudicial killings. ” Baraa Shiban, a Yemeni fellow for Reprieve, a   human rights group, said he spoke by phone to a tribal sheikh in the village, Jabbr Abu Soraima, who told him: “People were afraid to leave their houses because the sound of choppers and drones were all over the sky. Everyone feared of being hit by the drones or shot by the soldiers on the ground. ” After initially denying there were any civilian casualties, Pentagon officials backtracked somewhat on Sunday after reports from the Yemeni authorities begin trickling in and grisly photographs of bloody children purportedly killed in the attack appeared on social media sites affiliated with Al Qaeda’s branch in Yemen. Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said on Monday that some of the women were combatants. The operation was the first known   ground mission in Yemen since December 2014, when members of SEAL Team 6 stormed a village in southern Yemen in an effort to free an American photojournalist held hostage by Al Qaeda. But the raid ended with the kidnappers killing the journalist and a South African held with him. That mission and the raid over the weekend revealed the shortcomings of secretive military operations in Yemen. The United States was forced to withdraw the last 125 Special Operations advisers from the country in March 2015 after Houthi rebels ousted the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, the Americans’ main counterterrorism partner. The loss of Yemen as a base for American counterterrorism training, advising and   was a significant blow to blunting the advance of Al Qaeda’s branch in the country and keeping tabs on their plots. The Pentagon has tried to start rebuilding its counterterrorism operations in Yemen, however last year, American Special Operations forces helped Emirati troops evict Qaeda fighters from the port city of Mukalla."
Girls stay up late to see Hillary Clinton make history," (CNN) Forgive the little girls in your life if they’re a little groggy this morning. They put in a late night watching history. Hillary Clinton’s the first female presidential nominee of a major political party. And when she accepted the Democrats’ nomination last night it was a thrilling moment, no matter what side of the political aisle you’re on. The chances of America having a female head of state for the first time in its   history are much closer to reality. So close that many parents let little girls across the country stay up late and soak in the historic moment."
Dallas Democrats Fret over Threat of ‘Voter Fraud’,"Two prominent north Texas Democrats are sounding the alarm on the threat of a   concern: voter fraud. [Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings (D) and State Representative Eric Johnson (  100) submitted a letter Thursday to Dallas County Elections Administrator Toni   after public concerns continued to mount about scores of reports involving a potential absentee voter fraud scheme.  “According to reports, dozens of voters received   ballots they never requested,” the letter states, which “suggests the possibility of a coordinated effort to benefit a candidate or candidates in the upcoming Dallas City Council elections. ” As Breitbart Texas previously reported, the episode began when West   pastor James Armstrong alerted local media and officials alike that some of his congregants came forward with evidence that absentee ballots were arriving at their respective homes without first asking for them, as Texas law requires. “It’s just a travesty that we are dealing with this,” Armstrong told NBC DFW at the time. “Seniors who have lived in this neighborhood all of their life and are now being taken advantage of. ” Another community resident, Alice Washington, 81, lodged similar complaints with the County via her niece, Barbara Roberson. “I said, ‘Would you please send me a copy of that application because I’d like to see her signature’,” Roberson told WFAA at the time. “Someone forged her signature,” said Roberson after review of the paperwork. In the week following, dozens of similar complaints have been made, according to Mayor Rawlings’ joint letter. The duo also notes a possible pattern in recent elections: What’s more startling is that this is the second time in less than a year that we have heard reports of irregularities in West Dallas. In November, media reports indicated someone fraudulently mailed ballots for dozens of elderly or dead voters. Previous Breitbart Texas coverage noted where election integrity experts explained root causes for the latest episode and steps Texas can take to fix the matter going forward: Election integrity advocates have argued that absentee ballot problems can sometimes be rooted in poor maintenance of the underlying voter records. The Public Interest Legal Foundation noted in response to the Dallas episode that Texas should consider tightening procedures for requesting absentee ballots. “As long as you have a name and address of another voter, you’re good to go   …     You don’t even need to give a birth date,” a group spokesperson told Lifezette. Analysts say that requiring absentee ballot applications to include driver’s license or other   identification numbers could cut down impersonation attempts like claimed by the Washington family. Recent fraud conspiracies prosecuted in southern Texas point to a possible example for how elderly voters are preyed upon through the mail voting system. After an unsolicited ballot arrives, an illicit     political operative would visit the recipient’s home, offering “assistance” with completing and returning the form with   candidates in mind. One recent Texas case involved a U. S. Postal Service delivery man taking bribes in trade for allowing “politiqueras” to follow his truck, indicating which homes received ballots. The mailman also allegedly took part in campaigning for local Democrat candidates while in uniform as well. Short of legislative reforms, Mayor Rawlings and Rep. Johnson were left to implore   to “devote additional resources to verify the integrity of each   ballot in Dallas. ” Rawlings Johnson Re Mail Ballots by BreitbartTexas on Scribd,  Logan Churchwell is a founding editor of the Breitbart Texas team.

Coahuila: How a Border State Government Covered up a Massacre,"PIEDRAS NEGRAS, Coahuila  —   Four years have passed since state authorities claimed to begin investigating how gunmen with Los Zetas cartel were able to kidnap, murder, and exterminate hundreds of victims from rural communities in this border state between 2011 and 2013. The case became one big cover up. [In early 2016, Breitbart Texas reported on how Los Zetas used ovens and   drums to incinerate hundreds of victims from the northern part of the state. The massacre began in 2011 in Allende, Coahuila, but continued for two years throughout the region and in this city. It continued without any state authority making an effort to stop it while local news outlets were muffled. Years later, government officials confirmed that approximately 150 victims were incinerated inside the state prison in Piedras Negras.   At the time, the Coahuila Attorney General’s Office was run by Jesus Torres Chaires, an individual who was singled out in U. S. Court testimony as having received money from Los Zetas. The allegations against Torres Chaires were made by Rodrigo Humberto Uribe Tapia during a   federal trial of a top Zeta associate in Texas. The testimony pointed to Los Zetas giving millions to the state attorney general who in turn would give some of that money to the former Governor Humberto Moreira. As Breitbart Texas reported, Moreira is just one of various Mexican governors who were linked in U. S courts to Los Zetas. Court documents published by this outlet reveal that the U. S. government considered the entire structure of the Coahuila government to be a surrogate of Los Zetas cartel.  In an interview with Mexico’s Vanguardia, Torres Chaires claimed that the allegations about him taking money from Los Zetas were lies and he was trying to move on from the events of the massacre in Allende, which he described as things that just happened.  At the time of the massacre and in the years after, the top lawmen in the northern region of Coahuila were Santos Vasquez Estrada and Patricia Rivera Barrera, each during their respective term held the position of PGJE Delegate in Pedras Negras and oversaw most of the rural communities where Los Zetas carried out their massacres. Individuals interviewed by Breitbart Texas revealed that neither of the two officials made any effort to investigate, identify, or target any of the real individuals behind the massacres or the masterminds behind the current drug traffickers in the area. Since the massacre, authorities have publicized the charging of various   Zeta bosses however, the real actors behind the various massacres in the state have escaped scrutiny.  While Vasquez left the PGJE and is currently a criminal defense attorney, Rivera Barrera continues to work at the agency. Breitbart Texas was able to confirm that Rivera Barrera lost her top post in the PGJE after she traveled to Mexico City to take an integrity test commonly called “examen de confianza”  —   she failed. Local news outlets erroneously reported that Rivera Barrera had been fired from her job in early 2016.  Rather than being fired from her post by current Coahuila Attorney General Homero Ramos Gloria, Rivera Barrera was simply moved to oversee a PGJE archive warehouse where she continues to collect a director’s salary.  While Rivera Barrera failed the integrity tests required by her agency, during her term as the delegate she was able to establish close relations with various U. S. law enforcement agencies and often traveled to Eagle Pass, Texas, and other U. S. cities to interact with her counterparts.  Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used. Breitbart Texas’ Cartel Chronicles are published in both English and in their original Spanish. This article was written by “J. M. Martinez” from Piedras Negras, Coahuila."
Preliminary Approval Given to $208.7 Million NCAA Settlement - Breitbart,"About 40, 000 college football and basketball players will not need to submit a claim to receive a portion of the $208. 7 million the NCAA will pay to settle a federal   lawsuit that claimed the value of their athletic scholarships was illegally capped. [U. S. District Judge Claudia Wilken in California gave preliminary approval Tuesday to the settlement that was agreed upon by the NCAA and plaintiffs in February. Hagens Berman, the law firm representing plaintiffs, says each eligible person will receive approximately $6, 500 and it can begin mailing notice to class members by July.  “We’re grateful to the court for preliminarily approving this monumental settlement that will bring real change to the way the NCAA treats Division I players, and grateful to the players themselves for stepping up to the plate,” lead attorney Steve Berman said in a statement. Final approval of the settlement from Wilken is scheduled for November. The original antitrust lawsuit was filed in 2014 by former West Virginia football player Shawne Alston. The case was later combined with other lawsuits and covers Division I men’s and women’s basketball players and FBS football players who competed from   and did not receive a    stipend. “We are pleased the court has provided preliminary approval in a portion of the    lawsuit,” Donald Remy, NCAA chief legal officer, said in a statement. “The judge’s decision allows us to begin steps toward providing class members funds up to, but not exceeding, their full cost of attendance. ” In January 2015, the five wealthiest college conferences  —   the Atlantic Coast Conference, Big Ten, Big 12,   and Southeastern Conference  —   passed NCAA legislation that allowed schools to increase the value of an athletic scholarship by several thousand dollars to the federally determined actual cost of attending a college or university. Cost of attendance includes expenses beyond tuition, room and board, books and fees. The settlement will be fully funded by NCAA reserves, the association has said. No school or conference will be required to contribute."
"Dwyane Wade, back in Chicago, confronts its problems"," (CNN) The Uber driver turned toward me with a look of genuine concern when she confirmed our destination, East 58th Street and South King Drive, and exclaimed, ”That is NOT a good area!”  On that particular crisp late October evening, at least, I felt perfectly safe. I arrived at Washington Park on Chicago’s South Side to meet Dwyane Wade, the     star, who was filming a commercial for Gatorade, one of his sponsors.   There was plenty of private security keeping an eye on the star.  Our biggest concern for the interview was whether   from the street would disrupt our audio as fans gawked at the   NBA   and the   production in progress.  The incongruity of glitz in one of the city’s most violent neighborhoods was stark, and I was there to ask him the unanswerable: What can he or anyone else do to address the epidemic of gun violence in Chicago? By then I’d already spent some time in the city’s troubled neighborhoods trying to understand why an extraordinary number of young black men are picking up guns and ending other young black men’s lives (nearly all the known shooters and most victims are young black men).  They just look like neighborhoods,  What stood out to me immediately was how unremarkable the neighborhoods themselves are.  Small houses,    apartment buildings, small clusters of business.  A drive around the community doesn’t hint at statistics that suggest a war zone. Chicago has recorded more than 700 homicides already this year, a grim threshold not reached in decades. More than 90% of those killings were shootings, and the vast majority of victims were killed within five police districts south and west of the Chicago Loop. The issue became tragically personal for Wade in August, just over a month after he chose to sign a free agent contract with the Chicago Bulls that would bring him home for the first time in his NBA career.   Wade’s cousin,    Nykea Aldridge, was caught in crossfire as two gunmen    police say they were gang members out of prison on parole    fired at a rival.  The mother of four was pushing her baby in a stroller on the way to register her kids at school when she was killed.   ”When your Auntie is the one crying on your shoulder. If you’re looking at your nephews and nieces and their lives are turned upside down,” Wade says, ”it becomes real.” As sickening as the circumstances of Aldridge’s murder were, the reality is that in 2016 her story would barely have registered if not for her famous cousin.   Wade grew up on the South Side and in the South suburbs. He’s   with the area’s rough edges.  As he and others have noted, gang violence has been a problem in Chicago since Al Capone was shooting up the South Side during Prohibition.   No boundaries, lots of fear, What’s changed, I was told repeatedly, is that gangs no longer operate predictably. Perversely, a void in gang leadership, for lack of a better word, has led to a breakdown in boundaries.  Wade says as a child the bad guys in his neighborhood watched out for him and his family. For the most part gangs limited their violence to turf wars, gangs vs. gangs.  Locals say the shootings today seem arbitrary by comparison. Fueled by drugs, incited by the smallest perceived slight    often stemming from social media feuds    or for no apparent reason at all, they shoot.   There is no mediation. No conflict resolution. No trust for police intervention. Just guns, which can be had ”in five minutes,” and vengeance. The fear is palpable, even among gang members themselves.   As part of our effort to understand the problem, we arranged   interviews with a pair of young men described to us as gang members, one in his teens and one in his  .   We agreed to preserve their anonymity by obscuring their faces and altering their voices after the fact so they could speak freely, but when the cameras rolled they got cold feet.  Eyes darting, shifting in their seats, neither would admit to gang activity or shed light on gang life. Later I was assured they were, in fact, affiliated. The younger of the two was described to me as a ”shooter.” The older, who reeked of marijuana, dropped a roll of cash as he got up from his chair.  It was a frustrating and confusing exercise, but what stuck with me was that these guys are scared. Director, priest help in their own ways, Spike Lee, who tackled the causes and effects of Chicago’s growing body count in his extravagant film ”Chiraq,” calls for federal intervention.   ”A state of emergency should be called for the city of Chicago,” he says. ”I think they could bring in the National Guard. What the mayor’s doing is not working.” I spoke with Lee in the gym at St. Sabina Catholic Church, where the Rev. Michael Pfleger was holding the annual Peace Games, a day of basketball born of the idea that a court could be common ground for gangs. Lee based a character in ”Chiraq” on Pfleger, an activist Catholic priest who has advocated for the underserved population in Chicago’s troubled West and South sides since the 1960s.   ”I think it takes one loving them,” he says of the neighborhood kids he tries to redirect. ”Respecting them. Holding them accountable, then giving them options.  You can’t just tell somebody to put down the gun or stop selling drugs. You’ve got to give them something, not just tell them what not to do.” Pfleger’s basketball game, which he began five years ago, has since expanded into a league and, more importantly, an education and jobs program. Dozens of the young men who arrived at his gym as hardened gang members    ”brothers from the block,” he calls them    have found their way to college or   employment, monumental achievements in neighborhoods where it’s easier to get a gun than a job. Jonathan Owens is one of Pfleger’s success stories. He came to St. Sabina as a Peace Games player and now holds down a   job. But it’s easy to hear the despair in his voice when he describes the mindset of so many young men in his neighborhood focused on settling scores. ”It’s people want to get even,” he says. ”They don’t want to let the police deal with it because they feel like the police is bad    ’We going to take it into our own hands. We going to go get even,’ or if they don’t want to get even they want to take more.  I don’t believe it’s ever going to stop, sometimes.” Wade and his family try to forgive, Like thousands of Chicagoans directly affected by gun violence, Wade and his family are struggling to make sense of the senseless, and trying to forgive. Wade says the men accused of killing his cousin are both perpetrators and victims.   ”A lot of it comes from their environment,” Wade says.  ”A lot of it comes from what they know, and that’s not their fault.” Of course it’s no one person’s or entity’s fault, and it will take more than one person for an entire community to claw out of the abyss, but Wade feels the weight of expectation that he’ll help solve the problem.  Many see opportunities for investment in empty storefronts and look to Wade and other successful Chicagoans to pitch in.   The most vulnerable young people, the ones who wind up picking up the guns that are ubiquitous in those areas, are the ones with nothing better to do.  These neighborhoods are in desperate need of investment and local businesses owned by people with stakes in those communities. Wade says he plans to do his part, but he quickly points out his contributions will mean nothing if parents aren’t parenting, if the police can’t regain the trust they’ve lost, and if the business owners aren’t hiring. ”I know that I will donate money to the city of Chicago to try to help certain communities,” he says. ”I know I will do that. But as I do my job others have to do theirs.  Obviously we put responsibility on our youth, but they’re following their adults.” Understandably many don’t want to wait to find out what comes next.  The Uber driver, the young woman worried about my   told me she began planning her escape from Chicago when a bullet penetrated the front wall of her home and into the living room where her toddler was playing.  She asked how I like Atlanta."
Email: DNC Plotted to Stage Protests at Trump Meeting - Breitbart,"An email published in recent days by Wikileaks shows the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in cahoots with controversial Democratic operative Robert Creamer to “get some folks out front” of the Republican National Committee (RNC) to protest Donald Trump at a meeting the presidential candidate held with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan. [The   May 12, 2016 meeting at the RNC’s headquarters in Washington between Trump and Ryan featured scores of supposed   protesters outside being filmed by the news media.  The news media largely featured the protesters as legitimate   activists. The email captured by Wikileaks, however, betrays a different story. The May 10, 2016 correspondence was titled, “Action in front of RNC on Thursday morning for   meeting. ” In the message, Eric Walker, Deputy Communications Director at the DNC, discussed staging protests at the RNC’s headquarters in Washington during the meeting between Trump and Ryan. The email, sent to two other DNC staffers, reveals Walker suggested ideas for   signs to be brandished by the alleged protesters: We should come up with signs to pass out. A few ideas (throw some ideas down here if you have them): * Reject the   Agenda, *Donald Trump: Dangerous, Divisive, Disgraceful (my favorite) *Dump Trump, *Love Trumps Hate (HFA tagline) * Say No to Bigotry   Say No to Trump, * Trump = Make America Hate Again (2nd choice) Walker further relates he “discussed” planning for the purported protest with Creamer. He writes: Discussed with Creamer, et. al. today. We are calling through allied groups to get some folks out front of the RNC before 9 a. m. There will be a separate action in front of the NRSC at 11:30 with the message being “Don’t Let Republicans Trump the Supreme Court”  —   mostly being handled by woodhouse   groups that have been engaged on SCOTUS push. The supposed protest outside the RNC meeting made headlines. The Washington Post published a story on the event that included video of a handful of supposed   protesters outside the RNC confab brandishing   placards. The Hill reported on the purported protestors: “The scene outside Republican National Committee (RNC) headquarters on Thursday was chaotic, with protesters and supporters of Donald Trump showing up in response to the presumptive presidential nominee’s meeting with Speaker Paul Ryan ( . ). ” “Protesters, Media Outside   Meeting,” was the title of a USA Today online video of the event. NPR reported that “Colorful protests surrounded Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington, D. C. Thursday morning as Donald Trump met with House Speaker Paul Ryan and other officials inside. ” Creamer, meanwhile, stepped back from his responsibilities working with the campaign after a video released by James O’Keefe and his organization, Project Veritas Action, reportedly showed the Democratic operative hiring people to protest at Trump events and allegedly to incite violence. Creamer’s associations with Clinton’s presidential campaign came in the form of activism on behalf of his organization, Democracy Partners, a progressive consulting group, and Creamer’s position as leader of Mobilize, which was contracted with the DNC. Following O’Keef’s video, Creamer released a statement that he is “unwilling to become a distraction to the important task of electing Hilary Clinton, and defeating Donald Trump in the upcoming election  …     As a result I have indicated to the Democratic National Committee that I am stepping back from my responsibilities working with the campaign. ” Creamer told CNN that he was referring to work for Clinton’s campaign, and he confirmed to the news agency that he was “fully integrated” with the campaign.

David Martosko writes at the Daily Mail:    Donald Trump’s top strategist sat for a rare radio interview Friday morning, urging conservative voters to ‘hold people accountable’ in the White House  —   including himself  —   as the new administration gets off the ground. Steve Bannon, Trump’s senior counselor  —   soon to be   Americans’ avatar in the West Wing  —   said afterward that he specifically wants Trump’s base to hold his feet to the fire as he steers the president’s strategic ship through waters infested with Democrats and moderate Republicans alike. ‘Deplorables and Hobbits should stay engaged and hold ALL of us accountable  —   including me,’ Bannon told DailyMail. com in a text message.

It’s official: Trump is Republican nominee,"Cleveland (CNN) Donald Trump, the billionaire businessman whose outsider campaign has both galvanized millions of voters and divided the Republican Party, is the 2016 GOP presidential nominee. The New Yorker’s embrace by the Republican National Convention marks a remarkable moment in U. S. political history and validates a campaign that shattered precedent, defied pundits and usurped the GOP establishment. His son Donald Trump, Jr. cast the votes for the New York delegation that put the billionaire businessman over the top of the 1, 237 delegates he needed to clinch the nomination, as any talk of disruptive protest votes or walkouts dissipated. ”It is my honor to be able to throw Donald Trump over the top in the delegate count tonight with 89 delegates,” Donald Jr. said, surrounded by three of Trump’s other children    Ivanka, Eric and Tiffany. ”Congratulations Dad, we love you.” An emotional Ivanka Trump told CNN’s Dana Bash immediately after her father was confirmed as the Republican nominee, ”It’s unbelievable, it’s surreal, I am so proud of my father.”  ”I have never underestimated my father, ever,” Eric Trump said. Donald Jr. was tearing up when he told Bash that putting his father over the top was ”one of the more surreal moments of my life other perhaps than the birth of my children. To be able to do that is historic, its awesome.” ”It’s pretty real.” Trump is scheduled to address the convention via remote from New York in the evening, but tweeted shortly after the vote. ”Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States. I will work hard and never let you down! AMERICA FIRST!” Protests fizzle, An effort to place the name of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for nomination fizzled late Tuesday afternoon. The effort had no chance of success since most of the delegates won by Trump in his GOP nominating victory were bound to vote for him in the roll call under the rules of the Republican primary process. Cruz’s inner circle had adamantly opposed any attempt to involve him in last minute convention floor intrigue, a senior adviser to the Texas senator told CNN. ”We’re not encouraging it. We’re actually trying to stop it,” the adviser said. A rebellion would have emphasized the divides in the GOP torn open by Trump’s campaign, which was given little chance of success when he descended a golden escalator in Trump Tower with his wife Melania to set his sights on the White House last year. Protests erupt at RNC, Trump’s name was put into the nomination by Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, an early supporter of the businessman, and was seconded by fellow early supporters New York Rep. Chris Collins and South Carolina Lt. Gov.  Henry McMaster. ”We have gotten off course and the American people know it,” Sessions said in his speech, warning that crime is rising, terrorist attacks are proliferating, and Congress is deadlocked, arguing that Trump is the only answer. ”The American voters heard his message and they rewarded his courage and his leadership with a huge victory in our primaries,” Sessions said, drawing raucous cheers from Trump fans on the convention floor. ”He loves his country and he is determined to see it be a winner again,” Sessions said. ”Donald Trump is the singular leader that can get this country back on track. He has the strength, the courage the will to get it done.” Trump’s roll call will be followed by the nomination and vote for Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as the vice presidential nominee. Tuesday’s vote passed more smoothly than events on the convention floor Monday when holdouts tried to embarrass Trump by initiating a fight over rules of the gathering.  Trump’s team monitored delegates to quell any kind of rebellion, with a team of whips on the floor and eyes in the sky. The Trump delegate brain trust was holed up in a skybox inside the convention center where they tracked the movement of delegates as the roll was called. Trump whips wore neon green hats to make it easier for them to spot."

Ben Carson captures southern Republican straw poll,"Washington (CNN) Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson handily won the Southern Republican Leadership Conference straw poll on Saturday, the first major survey to take the temperature of the Republican presidential field in the south. Carson, a staunch opponent of Obamacare who is popular among social conservatives, captured 25. 4% of the vote in a pool that counted nearly 20 candidates, including announced and prospective hopefuls for the party’s 2016 nomination.   Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz also received large shares of the vote, finishing with 20. 5% and 16. 6% respectively. The SRLC said in a press release that the survey is one of the first straw polls of the 2016 cycle ”and is an indicator of southern primary voter support.” ”This was an energetic and inspiring conference,” conference chair Steve Fair said in the release. ”If the level of interest in this straw poll is any indicator, a Republican candidate will be well positioned to retake the White House in 2016.” The conference, which was held in Oklahoma City, began on Thursday and ended Saturday. The event hosted 13 ”possible” presidential contenders, the release said, as well as several governors, congressional leaders and other prominent Republicans. A total of 958 voted in the straw poll, a total of 64% of the conference’s registered attendees, the release said. Voting was conducted both   and online only by registered attendees who physically attended the conference."
POLLAK: Adm. Mike Mullen’s Partisan Attack on Steve Bannon - Breitbart,"Admiral Mike Mullen served the United States with the greatest distinction, serving as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. [His attack in Monday’s New York Times on White House adviser (and former Breitbart News chair) Steve Bannon, however, does a disservice to the public policy debate about national security strategy.  Adm. Mullen objects to Bannon’s appointment to the National Security Council (NSC). He admits, however, that President Bush’s NSC “was arranged similarly to Mr. Trump’s,” albeit with the exclusion of political guru Karl Rove. He also admits President Obama included his own political adviser, David Axelrod, in NSC meetings  —   even though Axelrod had no military or foreign policy experience whatsoever (and close ties to the   left and Chicago’s corrupt Democratic machine). In addition, Adm. Mullen complains about “Mr. Bannon’s troubling public positions. ” Adm.  does not list which positions he means  —   hoping, perhaps, that the false innuendos of mainstream media attacks will fill in the blanks for the Times‘ readers. USA Today recently reviewed hundreds of hours of Bannon’s radio commentaries and found none of the racism, antisemitism or “white nationalism” that the Times, among others, falsely ascribed to him. All it found was that Bannon worried about the threats posed by Islam and China. Those are threats most Americans also take seriously  —   and which, presumably, Adm. Mullen did as well. Where Adm. Mullen’s argument really begins to take on water is when he worries that Bannon’s presence would disrupt what is supposed to be a “nonpartisan” institution. It is hard to imagine a more partisan security apparatus than that which emerged on Adm. Mullen’s watch, when the military undertook   changes such as the end of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. ” And though generals asked for more troops in Afghanistan, the president gave them less than they needed  —   along with a   timeline that ended, conveniently, in time Obama’s  . And the disastrous 2011 pullout from Iraq flew in the face of Adm. Mullen’s own recommendation to Congress, in 2007, that success required a   commitment there. Bannon’s official job title is not political adviser, but “Chief Strategist. ” That undoubtedly involves some political advice, but it also points to a role in maintaining the coherence of Trump administration policies. That is crucial in a White House led by a political outsider with a   mandate for change. Bannon’s own naval experience, and his immersion in history and foreign policy, qualify him for the role. And speaking as his former colleague at Breitbart News, I can testify to his   in moments of crisis. I feel more secure knowing Steve is advising our president  —   and I believe others should, as well. In a “disruptive” presidency, he is a stabilizing influence, as he was on the campaign trail. President Trump seems to agree. Adm. Mullen says he worries about “a blurring of presidential responsibilities  —   Republican Party leader and commander in chief. ” But the Constitution recognizes no such distinction, and the time for worrying about that began in January 2009, when for the first time, the U. S. military was led by a    who placed his own political fortunes ahead of the safety and security of the American people. The morning after the Benghazi attacks in 2012, for example, President Obama flew to Las Vegas for a political fundraiser. None of his predecessors  —   not even President Jimmy Carter  —   would have done that. President Trump, like his predecessors, deserves to choose his team, and a leader of Adm. Mullen’s stature should not lend his name to partisan and evidently misinformed attacks. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

Mexican Cartel Gunfight Caught on Video: Los Zetas Civil War Claims 3 More Lives,"Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas and Coahuila to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used. Breitbart Texas’ Cartel Chronicles are published in both English and in their original Spanish. This article was written by “M. A. Navarro” from Ciudad Victoria.  CIUDAD VICTORIA, Tamaulipas  —   One of the latest chapter in the ongoing war between rival factions of Los Zetas brought terror to this city as gunmen and police forces clashed outside of a government building.   During the evening gun battle police officers killed two of the cartel   and ended up arrested two others. Before the firefight began, the gunmen had managed to murder a man selling flowers at a street corner. A video from government surveillance cameras provided by Mexican authorities shows the moment that cartel gunmen and police forces clashed. As seen in the video below, a massive deployment of police officers rushed to fight off the gunmen who were forced to make their stand after their vehicle flipped just yards from various office buildings.  Employees at a the city’s water office (Comapa) government office near the scene of the shootout were forced to take cover, however, one of them took video with his cell phone where the intensity of the gun battle can be heard.  According to information provided by the Tamaulipas government, the gunmen had been riding in an older Jeep at the time they shot at the flower vendor in the city’s downtown area. Police officers with Fuerza Tamaulipas near the scene of the shooting rushed to the scene as a high speed chase and rolling shootout began.  Other members of the Los Zetas faction set fire to three vehicles throughout the city in an effort to distract authorities. The raging gun battle and cartel activity forced residents in this city to lock themselves in their homes or offices in order to avoid becoming another victim. Rumors spread throughout the city that gunmen had even fired shots at the governor’s mansion, a version that the Tamaulipas government later denied.   The gunmen ended up along the banks of the San Marcos river, down the street from the government building when the gun battle began. During that shootout, police officers killed two gunmen, injured a third and arrested a fourth one.  As Breitbart Texas previously reported, two factions of the Los Zetas drug cartel have been fighting for control of the city. The fighting between Grupo Bravo and the faction called Cartel Del Noreste (CDN) has resulted in multiple gun battles,   shootings, executions, beheadings and dismemberments. The escalating violence has brought terror to this once tranquil city.  A   published by the social media page Reynosa Codigo Rojo revealed that Grupo Bravo took responsibility for the  . In that banner the Grupo Bravo threatened their rivals as well as members of Fuerza Tamaulipas led by “Lieutenant Tirado”. "
Bill Maher and Milo Yiannopoulos Find Common Ground - The New York Times,"Despite a brief   of controversy that preceded it, a conversation between Milo Yiannopoulos, the incendiary   author and lecturer, and Bill Maher, the comedian and host of HBO’s “Real Time,” on that program Friday night was a largely docile, chummy affair. There was little conflict or   as both men chided the political left for avoiding or drowning out Mr. Yiannopoulos’s views rather than engaging with them. Introducing Mr. Yiannopoulos, 32, an openly gay editor at Breitbart News, Mr. Maher said: “I think you’re colossally wrong on a number of things. But if I banned everyone from my show who I thought was colossally wrong, I would be talking to myself. ” Mr. Yiannopoulos began the interview by cracking jokes about gay people (whom he said he did not hire because they did not show up to work on time) and women, and telling Mr. Maher’s audience that they were “very easily triggered. ” “All I care about is free speech and free expression,” Mr. Yiannopoulos explained. “I want people to be able to be, do and say anything. These days, you’re right, that’s a conservative issue. ” Mr. Yiannopoulos had been scheduled to speak at the University of California, Berkeley, earlier this month, on an invitation from the school’s College Republicans group. But his talk was canceled when protests against the speech turned violent and led to rioting that caused about $100, 000 in damages. In January, when Mr. Yiannopoulos gave a lecture in Seattle at the University of Washington, a man was shot during protests outside the site of the speech. He spoke in December at the University of   where he mocked a transgender student while displaying her photograph during his talk. Other schools have withdrawn invitations to him in recent weeks. When it was announced on Wednesday that Mr. Yiannopoulos would be interviewed on “Real Time,” another scheduled guest, Jeremy Scahill, a journalist for The Intercept, said in a statement on his Twitter account that he was withdrawing from the show. “He has ample venues to spew his hateful diatribes,” Mr. Scahill said. “There is no value in ‘debating’ him. ” Mr. Maher followed with his own statement that said, “If Mr. Yiannopoulos is indeed the monster Scahill claims  —   and he might be  —   nothing could serve the liberal cause better than having him exposed on Friday night. ” In the interview on Friday night, Mr. Yiannopolous criticized female comedians like Amy Schumer and Sarah Silverman, and he described the Democrats as “the party of Lena Dunham,” the creator and star of “Girls. ” (Mr. Maher replied: “Let’s not pick on fellow HBO stars. There are so many other people. ”) Describing himself as “a virtuous troll,” Mr. Yiannopolous said, “I hurt people for a reason. ” He said people “want to police humor” because “they can’t control it. ” “Because the one thing that authoritarians hate is the sound of laughter,” Mr. Yiannopolous said. Mr. Maher added, “And also, because when people laugh, they know it’s true. ” Mr. Yiannopolous replied, “Nothing annoys people, or amuses people, like the truth. ” They then discussed an incident from last summer, when Mr. Yiannopoulos was banned from Twitter after helping rally other users to direct racist and sexist remarks at Leslie Jones, a star of “Ghostbusters” and “Saturday Night Live. ” “I didn’t understand, like, the ‘Ghostbusters’ thing,” Mr. Maher said. Mr. Yiannopoulos answered: “I wrote a bad review of a movie. Am I not entitled to do that?” After repeating some of the insults he had leveled at Ms. Jones, he said, “I simply don’t accept  —   I do not accept  —   that the star of a Hollywood blockbuster, that an     is crying over mean words on the internet. Get over it. ” “What actually hurts people is, like, murder, violence,” Mr. Yiannopoulos added. “That kind of stuff. ” He added that “mean words” don’t “hurt people. ” Mr. Maher said, “Which some people would say you have incited. ” Mr. Yiannopoulos reacted with surprise. “What? How?” he asked. “I’m just saying, some people would say,” Mr. Maher answered. Mr. Yiannopoulos replied, “Well, they would be idiots. ” Speaking to his audience, Mr. Maher said, “Stop taking the bait, liberals,” and asked how they could be afraid of someone he described as “little, British, impish” and a slur for gay people. The two men shook hands, and Mr. Maher moved on to his panel discussion. But in an   segment that ran after the HBO broadcast, Mr. Yiannopoulos said that transgender people were “vastly disproportionately involved in sex crime,” drawing jeers, boos and a shout of “liar” from Mr. Maher’s audience. Mr. Yiannopoulos also clashed with the comedian Larry Wilmore, another guest on the show. In remarks to Mr. Yiannopoulos that were bookended by an obscene phrase, Mr. Wilmore took offense at his Twitter trolling of Ms. Jones. “She’s a very thoughtful person and very funny,” he said. Trying to defuse the tension, Mr. Maher wryly suggested to Mr. Yiannopoulos that he shouldn’t be so quick to spar with his fellow panelists. “This is the beginning of your career,” Mr. Maher said. “People are only just starting to hate you. ”"
NYT: ’Public Safety’ At Risk if Donald Trump Signs National Reciprocity - Breitbart,"A New York Times editorial claims “public safety” would be at risk if Donald Trump signs national reciprocity for concealed carry permits into law. [The NYT suggested that such a move will only further the “fantasy” Trump embraced during the campaign the “fantasy that citizens can stand up to gunmen by shooting it out. ”  On June 27, 2016, approximately two weeks after the attack on the   zone in the Orlando Pulse nightclub, a concealed carry permit holder stopped a mass shooting outside a Spartanburg, South Carolina, nightclub. The concealed permit holder stopped the attempted mass shooting by drawing his own gun and shooting the attacker. May 31, 2015, an armed citizen pulled his own gun and opened fire on an alleged attacker inside a liquor store, thereby ending a   mass shooting. The incident occurred at the Magnet Bottle Shop in Conyers, Georgia, where the attacker was randomly shooting at anyone in his path.   year old Todd C. Scott drew his own gun and opened fire, ending the attack. On April 17, 2015, an Uber driver with a concealed carry permit thwarted an attempted mass shooting by pulling his own weapon and shooting a gunman who had opened fire in Chicago’s Logan Square. On March 22, 2015, a man who opened fire on children and adults in a Philadelphia barbershop was shot and killed by a citizen with a concealed carry permit. The permit holder was outside, walking past the barbershop when he heard shots. He ran inside and killed the attacker. The NYT also suggests the use of concealed carry handguns for   is a “myth. ” Here are a two recent examples of the “myth” taking place: On November 27, 2016, a food store clerk in Florida survived an armed robbery by pulling his concealed carry handgun and shooting —  and killing —  the armed assailant. Two weeks ago in Levittown, Pennsylvania, a customer in Porfirio’s II Pizza pulled a Glock handgun and shot and killed one of two alleged armed robbers and left the second robbery suspect in “serious condition. ” What follows is just a microcosm of the mythical used of concealed carry guns during 2014 and 2015. This list is a just a glimpse into a six week time period: (Nov. 30, 2015) A Washington state mother shot an alleged home invader to save her children. (Dec. 8, 2015) A veteran confined to walker used a gun to stop home invasion. (Dec. 9, 2015) Antioch, California, homeowner opened fire on two home invaders. (Dec. 19, 2015) A    shot and killed an intruder to save grandparents. (Dec. 20, 2015) A man used a handgun in   when confronted by an armed robber outside an Ohio mall. He killed the   robber, ending the attack. (Dec. 26, 2015) A Good Samaritan witnessed domestic attack, pulled pistol, and held the man at gunpoint until police arrived. (Dec. 27, 2015) A home invader put a gun to a woman’s neck in Memphis. The invader was shot and killed by the homeowner. (Dec. 28, 2015) A Bucks County, Pennsylvania, resident shot an intruder who broke through the glass door on her apartment. (Dec. 29, 2015) A home invader was shot and killed after a pregnant woman helped fight him off. (Dec. 30, 2015) A pastor shot a man who attacked him inside the church. (Dec. 30, 2015) A Texas fireworks stand owner used a gun to shoot and stop armed robbers. (Jan. 9, 2016) Four armed robbers stormed a women’s gun store in Shawnee, Kansas, and the  ’s life was spared when her husband intervened by opening fire on the suspects. (Jan. 10, 2016) A California homeowner survived an initial attack by a home invader, retrieved gun, and held the suspect at gunpoint until police arrived. (Jan. 11, 2016) A man put a gun to a Papa John’s Pizza delivery woman’s head she pulled her own gun and shot him in the face. (Jan. 12, 2016) An armed robber in a Milwaukee barber shop was shot and killed by a patron with a concealed carry  . (Jan. 13, 2016) An armed Taco Bell robber ordered   victim to drop his pants, but the victim pulled his gun instead and shot the robber dead. The NYT’s claims that it is “fantasy” to think concealed permit holders can stop shootings and that it is “myth” that concealed carry guns are used for   are not new. The NYT made very similar claims on October 26, 2015 and was aided, at that time, by a companion piece in The Washington Post which claimed that . 0002266% of concealed permit holders have been accused of a mass shooting. The WaPo suggested that such accusations against . 0002266% of permit holders proves concealed carry makes Americans less safe. But an armed citizen at the Orlando Pulse could have stopped or at least lessened that attack in the same way that the concealed permit holder stopped the March 22, 2015, attack at the Philadelphia barbershop. An armed citizen at the December 2, 2015, San Bernardino attack would have stopped or least lessened the severity of that vicious shooting spree. And armed citizens could have stopped or at least lessened the severity of the November 13, 2015, Paris attack that killed 130. Regarding Paris, Trump said: One of the things I bring up, and I bring it up all the time, is the Second Amendment. Because, when you look at that slaughter that took place —  Paris is one of the toughest guns zones, you can’t have a gun. France also, you can’t have a gun. It’s virtually impossible to get one. And you look at those places where it was carnage, it was horrible a horrible thing to watch and a horrible thing to see  …    .I can tell you, if people in that room —  some of them, you don’t need too many  …    [if they had had guns] they would have had a couple of killings but it wouldn’t have been the good buys, it would have been the bad guys. So Trump supports national reciprocity. It is a way to be sure there are more concealed carry permit holders in more places, ready and able to defend their lives and the lives of their fellow Americans. The NYT says this puts “public safety” at risk. AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of “Bullets with AWR Hawkins,” a Breitbart News podcast.

A $14 billion hedge fund is venturing where others fear to tread,"’  ’ ’   Canyon Capital Advisors, a $14 billion Los     investment firm set up  ’ ’ ”significant increase in supply” of   potential deals ”as companies having difficulty growing   organically have instead sought to buy growth.” ’ ’   At the same time, fewer investors are able to invest in these   kinds of deals, which generally involves buying the stock of a   company being acquired during a sale while selling off stock in   the acquiring company. ’ ”   Canyon cites the gutting of Wall Street banks’ proprietary desks,   which used to trade the banks’ own money, and the travails of   many   hedge funds which have suffered and can’t   take big positions any more.  ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   The strategy  —   in hedge fund jargon called risk or merger   arbitrage  —   is risky since deals often fall through.

Mark Zuckerberg just signed the death warrant for the smartphone,"”   It’s no secret Mark Zuckerberg is pinning Facebook’s prospects on   augmented reality  —   technology that overlays digital imagery onto   the real world, like Snapchat’s signature camera filters. ” ”   At this year’s F8 conference, taking place this week, Zuckerberg    on the company’s ambitious   master plan,   which was first revealed in 2016. According to this timeline,   Facebook expects to turn artificial intelligence, ubiquitous   internet connectivity, and virtual and augmented reality into   viable parts of its business over the next decade. ” ’  ’ ’   To accelerate the rise of augmented reality, a big part of the   plan, Zuckerberg   —   basically a set of   tools for outside developers to build   apps that   you can access from the existing Facebook app’’s camera. That   would theoretically open the door for Facebook to host the next   phenomenon like ”Pokémon Go.” ’ ’  ’ ”   While this announcement seems pretty innocuous, make no mistake  —     Facebook is  putting itself into direct competition with Google   and Apple, trying to create yet another parallel universe of apps   and tools that don’t rely on the smartphones’ marketplaces. As    Zuckerberg has long been   disappointed that Facebook never built a credible smartphone   operating system of its own. ” ”   This time, though, Facebook is also declaring war on pretty much   everyone else in the tech industry, too. While it’ll take at   least a decade to fully play out, the stuff Facebook is talking   about today is just one more milestone on the slow  and the rise of even   weirder and wilder futures. ” ’   Zuckerberg tipped his hand, just a bit, during Tuesday’’s Facebook   F8 keynote. During a demo of the company’’s vision for augmented   reality  —   in the form of a pair of   —   he showed how you   could have a virtual ”screen” in your living room, bigger than   your biggest TV. ’ ’   ”We don’’t need a physical TV. We can buy a $1 app ’’TV’’ and put it   on the wall and watch it,” . ”It’’s   actually pretty amazing when you think about how much of the   physical stuff we have doesn’’t need to be physical.” ’ ’  ’ ”   That makes sense, assuming you’re into the idea of wearing a   computer on your face (and you’re OK with Facebook  glitches and   all). ” ”   But it’s not just TVs. This philosophy could extend to   smartphones, smartwatches, tablets, fitness trackers, or anything   else that has a screen or relies on one to work. Zuckerberg even   showed off a street art installation that’s just a blank wall   until you wave the Facebook camera app over it to reveal a mural. ” ’   For Microsoft, which has already dipped its toe in this area with   its HoloLens holographic goggles, this is a foregone conclusion.    recently called the demise of the   smartphone the ”natural conclusion” of augmented reality and its   associated technologies. ’ ”   The problem, naturally, is that a huge chunk of the world’s   economy hinges on the production of phones, TVs, tablets, and all   those other things that Facebook thinks could be replaced with   this technology. ” ”   Even Zuckerberg acknowledges it’s a long road ahead. That said,   this Camera Effects platform, should it succeed in attracting a   bunch of users, could go down as a savvy move. The apps that are   built for the Facebook Camera today could wind up as the first   versions of the apps you’d use with those glasses. ” ’  ’ ”   In the short term, Facebook’s play for augmented reality is going   to look a lot like   —   and in a meaningful way, it is.   Facebook needs developer and user love, so it needs to keep   offering fun and funny tools to keep people from moving away from   using its apps. ” ’   In the long term, though, this is Facebook versus everybody else   to usher in an age of a new kind of computing  —   and pretty much   every tech company out there will get caught in the crossfire, as   Apple, Google, Microsoft, and more rush out their responses to   this extremely existential, but still meaningful, threat. ’ ”It’s no secret Mark Zuckerberg is pinning. ..” ’’ ’’ ’’"

As for America’s One China policy, “It absolutely is not a violation of the One China policy,” insisted Bolton. “Moreover, as significant and beneficial as I think the call was, it doesn’t necessarily foretell what comes next.

’Rolling Stone’ Magazine Settles Defamation Lawsuit over Fake University of Virginia Rape Story,"Rolling Stone magazine has reached a settlement with a former associate dean at the University of Virginia who charged the periodical with defamation over claims made in its disastrous, false college rape story from 2014. [The terms of the settlement with former   administrator Nicole Eramo are undisclosed but was deemed “amicable” by the magazine. The agreement brings an end to the lawsuit that brought turmoil to the school and raised serious questions about journalistic ethics, the Washington Post reports.  “We are delighted that this dispute is now behind us, as it allows Nicole to move on and focus on doing what she does best, which is supporting victims of sexual assault,” the victorious administrator’s lawyer said in a statement. The lawsuit was filed after the 2014 story entitled “A Rape on Campus,” began to unravel. The story claimed to chronicle a history of sexual assaults at a university fraternity house but was later proved to be based on lies. For months, the story was hailed as a tour de force for social justice and an expose of   “rape culture,” but it was not long before the claims of the central witness, named “Jackie,” were discredited. The whole story was a fiction invented by Jackie and Sabrina Rubin Erdely, the writer for the Rolling Stone. In 2015,  ’s Nicole Eramo had filed a defamation suit against the music magazine for its failed story. By October 2016, Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner officially apologized to Eramo for publishing the false story. In her suit, Eramo claimed she faced personal threats, lost professional credibility, and lost her capacity to work as an advocate for   prevention. The magazine’s lawyer admitted in court that the explosive revelations proving that its story was based on lies was “the worst thing to ever happen” to the magazine. Rolling Stone had initially filed a motion to vacate the judgment against it, but before the judge ruled on its motion, the magazine unexpectedly decided to settle.

Democrats’ Caucus-Chaos: Party Switched Iowa Delegate from Sanders to Clinton - Breitbart,"Iowa’s Des Moines Register is calling for a full audit of the Clinton vs. Sanders caucus count, and now the UK Guardian explains how the state’s Democrat Party bypassed the computer system to give at least one Bernie Sanders delegate to Hillary Clinton, without even notifying the precinct chair. [In Grinnell Ward 1, the precinct where elite liberal arts college Grinnell College is located, 19 delegates were awarded to Bernie Sanders and seven were awarded to Hillary Clinton on caucus night. However, the Iowa Democratic party decided to shift one delegate from Sanders to Clinton on the night and did not notify precinct chair J Pablo Silva that they had done so. Silva only discovered that this happened the next day, when checking the precinct results in other parts of the county. The shift of one delegate at a county convention level would not have significantly affected the ultimate outcome of the caucus, but rather, it raises questions about the Iowa Democratic party’s management of caucus night. Silva spoke with the Guardian and stressed that the issue was one of “confusion over party rules in an anomalous situation,” not underhanded   tactics.  However, it clearly was a unilateral action by the state party, and they ended up apologizing to the precinct chair for it: The precinct, which is the largest in the state had 925   and the Iowa Democratic party’s formula for apportioning delegates was not capable of fully dealing with circumstances in such a large precinct, he said. This meant that when people left the course of the caucus process, the algorithm wasn’t capable of dealing with the shift in delegates. As Silva explained it, the Iowa Democratic party’s formula for apportioning delegates left no method of dealing with one delegate in the precinct. Silva had anticipated this and sought clarification from a party staffer and laid out what seemed to be the correct method. When results were reported to the central reporting center in Des Moines, party staffers, who were able to adjust numbers reported in the much vaunted Microsoft app used by the Iowa Democratic party before they were released to the public, unilaterally made changes. And, as Silva noted: “They did it indirectly in my opinion. ” While Silva was grateful that he wasn’t called in the middle of the night about any issue, he was “kind of surprised” to see a result different than what he had reported the next day. Eventually, after lobbying both by Silva and former county chair Don Smith, they have received assurances that the delegate numbers for that precinct will be corrected. Smith explicitly told the Guardian that Iowa Democratic party executive director Ben Foecke had apologized to him over the unilateral action. The Sanders campaign has come up a bit short of alleging foul play, but it has suggested   cost Sanders a   victory in the state, and has called for the raw vote totals to be released. As of Friday afternoon, the Iowa state party gave no indication it would release the vote totals, or perform the audit demanded by the Des Moines Register. The wheel is likely to turn on this story after the New Hampshire primary, as it will on the Republicans’ more prosaic Iowa controversy.  Complaining about Iowa results after New Hampshire is usually a net minus for candidates, no matter the nature of the complaint.  It will be interesting to see if any changes are made for the 2020 caucuses, as the GOP made improvements after a messy operation in 2012."
Nigeria church collapse kills at least 23,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Officials have opened an investigation into how a church in the Nigerian city of Uyo collapsed during services Saturday, killing at least 23 people. Officials initially said as many as 50 worshipers could have been killed, but on Monday revised the death toll.  Rescue workers have recovered bodies and injured people from the rubble, said Aniekeme Finbarr, a media liaison for Gov. Udom Emmanuel of the state of Akwa Ibom.  ”It happened all at once. The faithful had been singing and dancing. It sounded like rain and the roof caved in and it all happened very quickly,” Finbarr said. The governor himself was at the church when it collapsed and narrowly escaped injury.  ”I was present at the church during the incident and shared in the agony of the moment,” he tweeted. Planks fell near the governor and destroyed his seat, said Meflyn Anwana, special assistant to the governor on new media. Emmanuel feels personally touched by the tragedy, Anwana said. He was visiting hospitals because the injured include Cabinet members, commissioners and members of his team. Emmanuel has declared Monday and Tuesday days of mourning across the state, where flags are to be flown at half staff.  He said he had set up a ”  panel of inquiry” to establish the cause of the collapse and to ”bring to book the persons who are found to have compromised professional standards in the construction of the building.”   He also ordered the immediate arrest of the contractor handling the building project. ’A lot of souls were lost’ ”It was a very terrible thing to watch,” said Inameti Effiong Udofia, a student who rushed to the scene right after the church collapsed. ”The whole building went down, and a lot of souls were lost.” Udofia saw and heard ”survivors screaming” and people running around. Some survivors’ legs were badly cut, he said.  ”A building contractor was lifting the steel with cranes to get at dead and injured,” he said. Like others in the community, Udofia was incensed about the tragedy. ”People are blaming the construction, but there were also too many people in that church.”  Emmanuel’s press secretary, Ekerete Udoh, said in a statement the church ”caved around them” at a ceremony to consecrate the church pastor’s becoming a bishop. Udoh said the state government would pay for the medical treatment of all those injured. Uyo is the capital of Akwa Ibom state, which is in Nigeria’s southern coastal region.  Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari commented on the disaster in a series of tweets, saying ”any tragedy that affects any part of Nigeria affects all of us.” He spoke with Emmanuel ”to commiserate with him” and ”asked the governor to convey to the people of Akwa Ibom the deep sorrow felt by me, and by the entire country, over this tragedy.”"

The Establishment Should Welcome Trump’s Plans For College Reform,"If there’s one thing the right can agree on, it’s that the American campus is in a desperate state. From Bill Kristol to Ann Coulter, there is consensus that higher education needs an overhaul. Whether it’s coddling “safe spaces” kangaroo courts for rape cases, or    identity politics, there are no shortage of problems to fix at American universities. [Indeed, even the liberal establishment agrees that something must be done. It wasn’t a conservative magazine that published The Coddling of The American Mind, and it wasn’t conservatives who   it. Even Michael Bloomberg and the Obamas have raised their voices against the spiral of irrationality currently consuming American campuses.  But who’s going to do anything about it? There’s me, of course —   I’ve achieved a number of victories this year, including strengthened free speech protections at the University of Minnesota and the resignation of a   professor at DePaul University. Despite being sniffed at by Reason editors and the   set, provocation gets things done. By the end of this tour I’ll have been on more college campuses than just about anyone. There’s no one in america better qualified to tell it like it is. But I’d be the first to admit that even i’m not enough on my own. (Okay, that’s not really true, but my editor asked me to tone it down a bit and i couldnt think of a better way to introduce the next paragraph). I may have wounded the   dragon of progressivism on campus, and left some of it’s more porcine practitioners winded (hi Trigglypuff) but to truly finish it off more systemic change is required. And for that, we need a President ready to take the radical steps necessary to redress the balance. In an interview with Inside Higher Ed, Sam Clovis, director of policy for Donald Trump, revealed how the presidential candidate’s platform is taking shape. The details should be encouraging for anyone who, like me, is concerned by the state of free speech and intellectual rigor at universities. First and foremost, Trump is considering moving the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Education to the Department of Justice. That’s important, because it was the OCR that triggered that disastrous rise of Title IX “tribunals” on campus. Better known as campus kangaroo courts, these were set up during the unsubstantiated and needless panic over “rape culture” on college campuses that held sway across much of the media and political culture in the years immediately prior to 2014. They are staffed by academics with no legal training, yet are given the ability to rule on whether students are guilty or innocent of sexual assault —   all while adhering to lower standards of proof than a criminal court. The result? Widespread travesties of justice across American campuses, and a slew of lawsuits from wronged young men whose only recourse to salvage their reputations is filing a suit against their own schools. Moving the OCR to the Department of Justice, where due process is unlikely to be just an afterthought, would be the first step on the road to reversing this catastrophic legacy of the Obama administration. We might see an immediate end of “Dear Colleague” letters that have had disastrous effects on campus culture and the quality of education received by students. There are also signs that a Trump administration would pressure colleges to create an environment more receptive to free speech and political diversity. “I think in the spirit of academic freedom, a college campus should be a place where people should be allowed to express themselves to the fullest as long as they don’t injure another party,” Clovis told Inside Higher Ed.  “When students react in a particular way and they make demands, there has to be a calm approach to it, to say, ‘Look, this is free speech and this is the speech that is on this campus. You may not agree with this individual, but this person on this campus, and you should hear what they have to say. ” In other words, Trump’s Department of Education would encourage college administrations to reject the demands of the most radical   speech tendencies on campus. Just imagine all the furious, Ada   resignations that would occur once such a policy got underway! Last but not least, Trump is looking to tackle the root of the rot on college campuses: fluff courses where undergraduates, instead of receiving an education, are indoctrinated into progressive dogmas that encourage   hatred and political intolerance. According to Clovis, Trump plans to make student loans less   for both colleges and students. Colleges will be forced to have “skin in the game” on student loans, sharing some of the loan’s risk, and taking a role in the approval process. This will force both colleges and students to think carefully about the job and income prospects associated with their chosen degrees. Or, in other words: “Do I really want to major in Feminist Dance Therapy rather than, say, Computer Science?” Want to close wage gap? Step one: Change your major from feminist dance therapy to electrical engineering. #NationalOffendACollegeStudentDay,  —   Christina H. Sommers (@CHSommers) November 10, 2015,  This cuts to the heart of the matter  —   with fewer students applying for the soft subjects, there won’t be a need for so many professors in those subjects. Which means the   ideological ones —   the Melissa Clicks, the Ada Wongs —   will be the first to go. With a few clever tweaks to the loans system, Trump could give college administrators the excuse they need to get rid of their worst elements (something, no doubt, that many of them are looking for). The establishment have their reasons for disliking Trump. They say they are doing so because of their principles —   which Trump supposedly violates. But those same members of the establishment have spent the last year publicly worrying about the state of college campuses. So far, Trump is the only candidate offering a credible and well   solution. Hillary Clinton is more likely to make the problem worse than fix it, and the Libertarians, true to form, are unlikely to be a serious option. Of course there is an even more important reason for conservatives to be trumpeting Daddy’s plan, and that is because it will have appeal to Bernie Sanders’ erstwhile supporters. There are millions of Bernie fans who are staunchly against Hillary Clinton despite their former hero supporting her. While Sanders is flying around in the jet his betrayal earned him, these supporters are desperately trying to figure out where their loyalty should go. To Clinton, who represents everything they hate, or Jill Stein, or has a snowball’s chance in hell of winning, and is quite obviously nuts? Or to Donald Trump, the only candidate who has real plans for reforming college. College is a hot topic for the Bernie voters, and while Trump won’t give them free college, seeing as how he lives in the real world and not a communist fantasy utopia, his plan is still much better than the alternative. The media will go dark on the college issue for fear of bringing Bernie fans into the Trump camp, but it isn’t even worth complaining about at this point. After all, if the democrats didn’t have the mainstream media (and the #NeverTrump crowd) pulling every trick in the book on Daddy, they wouldn’t have a sporting chance would they?

Guardian: Bill Clinton Debuts New Act Monday in New Hampshire,"David Smith and Sabrina Siddiqui report in the Guardian:  “New Hampshire tonight has made Bill Clinton the comeback kid. ” So said Bill Clinton himself in February 1992, when a   finish behind the now largely forgotten Paul Tsongas in the state’s Democratic primary revived his fortunes. Later that year he would unseat George HW Bush in the presidential election.   years later, “the comeback kid” will return to the stump in New Hampshire on Monday. He will be hoping to administer another   political resuscitation. After the sting of rejection in 2008, when his wife was bested by a young upstart named Barack Obama, he will make the case for Hillary Clinton’s second shot at becoming the first woman in the White House. This time the former secretary of state appears to be on course, with a comfortable lead in Democratic polls after debate performances that apparently neutralised the socialist insurgency of Bernie Sanders. Her campaign says it raised $37m in the past three months, a record for a   and more than $112m in all of 2015. The Republican field, meanwhile, remains overcrowded and chaotic. But the Bill factor is the great unknown. Thus far he has taken a back seat, accompanying his wife on occasional campaign stops but not taking centre stage. Even at the Democratic debates, he has travelled with Clinton but has not been inside the arena  —   often choosing to watch from the hotel. “His proper role in, and impact on, his wife’s candidacy is unsettled and unclear,” New York Times columnist Frank Bruni wrote last week. “He remains both wildly charismatic and maddeningly undisciplined. He connotes both prosperous times and cynical scheming. ” Now set to be unleashed, Bill’s magnetism and oratory could be the ultimate campaign weapon. He often ranks as the most popular living US president in surveys and his speech at the 2012 Democratic convention gave a major boost to Obama’s   campaign. But those very same qualities could also overshadow the former first lady, whom some regard as lacking a personable and relatable demeanor. Furthermore, Bill can be a loose cannon, prone to losing his temper and the kind of gaffes that hindered rather than helped in 2008. And this time the celebrated Clinton machine faces a challenge that might not quite compute, a man who describes himself as their “worst nightmare”: Donald Trump. Read the rest here."
US spy chief rejects Trump’s attack over Russia dossier,"Washington (CNN) The US director of national intelligence has denied that the intelligence community leaked claims that Russia holds compromising personal and financial information on   Donald Trump. In an unusual statement on Wednesday evening that highlighted tensions between spy chiefs and the incoming president, James Clapper, a key adviser to the US President on security and intelligence, rejected a suggestion by Trump that the agencies were responsible for the story going public. Clapper said he told Trump that intelligence agencies made no judgment about the reliability of the allegations. The claims were summarized in a   synopsis prepared for Trump and Barack Obama ahead of a national security briefing last week. Clapper’s statement amounted to the first public confirmation from a US official of CNN’s story that the synopsis existed and had been put together for the President,   and eight Congressional leaders. In his first news conference as   on Wednesday, Trump railed on the US intelligence agencies, suggesting they were responsible for leaking the ”nonsense” to the media. Any such move by the agencies would be a ”tremendous blot on their record,” he said. Before speaking with reporters, Trump went further in his attack. He said in a tweet: ”Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to ’leak’ into the public. One last shot at me. Are we living in Nazi Germany?” On Thursday, Trump confirmed on Twitter he had received a call from Clapper: ”James Clapper called me yesterday to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated. Made up, phony facts. Too bad!” Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, expressed skepticism at Trump’s claim that Clapper denounced the report. ”Sadly, you simply cannot rely on the  ’s tweets or statements about what he’s receiving in intelligence briefings, and that’s a real problem,” Schiff told CNN’s Chris Cuomo on ”New Day.”  ’Fullest possible picture’ The   synopsis    appended to a report on Russian interference in the 2016 US election campaign    was based on 35 pages of memos prepared by a former British intelligence operative working initially for Republican opponents of Trump, gathering opposition research about him during the presidential campaign, multiple US officials with direct knowledge of the briefings told CNN. Clapper said in his statement that the synopsis was included in the briefing because ”part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security.” ”The [intelligence community] has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable, and we did not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions,” Clapper noted. It has not been established whether the agencies raised the material from the   synopsis directly with Trump at their recent meeting. But the issue came up in Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo’s confirmation hearing to head the CIA Thursday. Asked by Maine Independent Sen. Angus King if Pompeo would explore questions that arose in those reports, Pompeo stressed that the allegations were unsubstantiated and that he considered the ”leaks that occurred” to be ”intensely serious.” Pompeo acknowledged Clapper’s statement and pledged that he ”will pursue the facts wherever they will take us . .. with respect to this issue and to each and every issue as well.” Trump clashes with media, At his press conference on Wednesday, Trump attacked CNN and Buzzfeed for their coverage of the story. CNN revealed only that intelligence officials had summarized the claims about Trump and prepared a briefing document, as it could not verify the claims contained in the full   set of memos prepared by the former British intelligence operative. Buzzfeed published the full, unverified memos. The clash between Trump, the intelligence agencies and the media makes it clear that the   will take office amid persistent questions about his relationship with Russia. While Trump was at the podium at Trump Tower on Wednesday, his nominee to become secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, faced tough questions on Capitol Hill about whether the incoming administration will view Russia with sufficient skepticism. At his news conference, Trump finally conceded he believes Russia was behind hacks on Democratic National Committee computers ahead of the election but argued that wouldn’t happen again. ”I think it was Russia,” Trump said. Russian President Vladimir Putin ”should not be doing it. He won’t be doing it. Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I am leading it than when other people have led it.” Trump, who has vowed to improve relations with Russia despite some Republican opposition, said he did not know if he would get along with Putin and noted it’s possible he won’t. But he could not resist a swipe at his defeated Democratic election rival, Hillary Clinton. ”Do you honestly believe Hillary would be tougher on Putin than me?” he asked."
Nacho Figueras: World’s most photographed man?," (CNN) Nacho Figueras. The chances are you won’t know the name but most likely you’ll recognize the face. It stares out at you from the pages of countless magazines and adorns billboards across the planet as the face of luxury fashion brand Polo Ralph Lauren. Figueras is polo’s answer to David Beckham, a sporting icon in his native Argentina who transcends his day job as a professional polo player. He is friends with Princes William and Harry, was once voted the world’s second most handsome man by Vanity Fair magazine (behind the actor Robert Pattinson) and has appeared in the TV series ”Gossip Girl.” In addition, he runs his own polo   program in Argentina    breeding between 70 and 80 horses each year    and uses his status for   charity work. Of the Beckham analogy, he says: ”I don’t know if that’s true. The comparison maybe comes from how much Beckham has done to promote football in the world. He has become a person that transcends football. ”You have Lionel Messi as the best footballer on the planet but he plays football, goes home, trains. For Messi, football is his work but Beckham’s work is broader than that. He and his wife are obviously very connected in the fashion world.” Figueras is well aware of his omnipresence in waiting rooms, magazine stalls and airports the world over. Speaking to CNN in a phone interview from California where he is currently playing polo, he says without a hint of arrogance: ”It’s very rare that you open a magazine and I’m not in it in one of the photographs.” But don’t make the mistake of calling Figueras a model. ”I’m not a model, I’m a polo player,” he says, describing the Ralph Lauren work as endorsements and marking himself as a brand ambassador rather than a model. ”Models are on the catwalk.” The Argentinian’s path into such side work began at the behest of the celebrated photographer Bruce Weber, who introduced Figueras, at the time playing polo in the Hamptons, to Ralph Lauren himself back in 1999. A year later, he started working for Ralph Lauren before becoming the face of Ralph Lauren Black Label in 2005. He has been under contract with the American company ever since. He readily admits that his connections with the brand have opened doors for him, allowing him to become increasingly involved in charity work perhaps most notably with Sentebale, a charity   by Prince Harry, which helps   children in Lesotho. Through that work and their shared love of polo, he has spent a lot of time with both British princes although is reluctant to overplay their relationship. ”That’s something you’ll have to ask them,” he says to the question of whether he calls them friends. ”I love working with Harry with the charity, to be able to give back. ”Both are very committed at giving back and polo is a good platform for them to do that as they’ve grown up with the sport.” Both brothers are accomplished players, says Figueras    Harry an attacking player, William more strong defensively    ”as they played since they were little, they’re very good.” As for Figueras, his own standards have slipped a little. Where once he was handicapped eight (10 is the highest in the sport,) he is now a six but still rates among the world’s top 100 players and, two years shy of his 40th birthday, has no plans to retire from the sport. ”Polo is No. 1, it’s what I do,” he adds. ”It’s still  % of my time and I’m still a young guy, okay, maybe not as young but still young so I want to play. ”I grew up playing polo and at   years old I decided I wanted to get serious about it. To start with, I loved the speed and adrenalin but now the horses are the big part of it for me.” That love of horses has spawned into his breeding program, Cria Yatay, from which he can sell the very best horses for up to $100, 000, although its    running is left to others. In contrast to the U. S. and the United Kingdom where polo tends to be the reserve of the elite, polo in Argentina is more accessible to those from a wide range of backgrounds. And his world renown has given him a certain amount of notoriety back in Argentina, although he laughs at any parallels drawn between him and Argentina’s No. 1 sporting icon. ”In Argentina, football is king and he’s the leading player,” says Figueras. ”I don’t think you can compare any athlete to Messi, he’s just on a different level. Polo is big in Argentina but Messi is huge.” Read: Can drones revolutionize polo"
New Hillary Clinton Lie: I Used Secure Email for Classified Info,"At the NBC News “Commander in Chief” forum on Wednesday night aboard the U. S. S. Intrepid in New York, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton invented a new alibi for her   of classified information, telling host Matt Lauer that she used a secure server when she needed to send classified information. [In July, FBI director James Comey revealed that Clinton not only withheld and deleted   emails, but also sent classified emails  —   many marked as such  —   on her private,   email server.  Clinton told Lauer on Wednesday evening: I communicated about classified material on a wholly separate system. I took it very seriously. When I traveled, I went into one of those little tents that I’m sure you’ve seen around the world because we didn’t want there to be any potential for someone to have embedded a camera to try to see whatever it is that I was seeing that was designated, marked, and headed as classified. In fact, the FBI report released last week confirmed that Clinton declined to use a state. gov email account, and defied her own department’s policy to use an “authorized information system” for official business. She had no computer in her office, which was a secure environment, nor did she use a computer inside the secured area in her homes. (In her FBI interview, she said she could not recall receiving any advice about email policies.) The report implies that the only time Clinton used a secure system for sending email was when she was traveling abroad  —   when State Department career staff, not her personal entourage, were responsible for setting up her communications. As   PolitiFact noted in July: To electronically transmit classified information, State Department employees must use a specific closed system, not their usual @state. gov email addresses. Clinton has said she viewed classified information in hard copy in her office, and she used other secure channels when traveling. Some emails now made public actually show Clinton’s team discussing how they couldn’t email each other classified information over the private server and instead had to move the conversation to a more appropriate venue. So while it might be true that Clinton used a secure system when abroad, she did not use that system as a matter of routine when sending classified material. Quite the opposite, in fact: at least some of the time, she sent and received classified information and documents, including emails pertaining to drone strikes, on her private, secret,   server. If there is evidence she used a secure server to send email while inside the U. S. the public has yet to see it. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

"As Trump Orders Wall, Mexico’s President Considers Canceling U.S. Trip - The New York Times","MEXICO CITY  —   When Donald J. Trump called some Mexican immigrants rapists, threatened to deport millions of them and promised to build a wall to keep others out, Mexican officials counseled caution, saying it was merely bluster from an unlikely candidate who, if elected, would never follow through. Now, after just five days in office, President Trump is looking a lot like Candidate Trump  —   and the Mexicans are furious. With just a few strokes of the pen on Wednesday, the new American president signed an executive order to beef up the nation’s deportation force and start construction on a new wall between the nations. Adding to the perceived insult was the timing of the order: It came on the first day of talks between top Mexican officials and their counterparts in Washington, and just days before a meeting between the two countries’ presidents. The action was enough to prompt President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico to consider scrapping his plans to visit the White House on Tuesday, according to Mexican officials. In a video message delivered over Twitter on Wednesday night, Mr. Peña Nieto did not address whether he would cancel the meeting, saying only that future steps would be taken in consultation with the country’s lawmakers. Instead, he reiterated his commitment to protect the interests of Mexico and the Mexican people, and chided the move in Washington to continue with the wall. “I regret and condemn the United States’ decision to continue with the construction of a wall that, for years now, far from uniting us, divides us,” he said. It mattered little to Mexicans whether Mr. Trump’s order would receive congressional approval or the funding required to fulfill it. The perceived insults endured during the campaign had finally turned into action. Decades of friendly relations between the nations  —   on matters involving trade, security and migration  —   seemed to be unraveling. Calls began to come in from across the political spectrum for Mr. Peña Nieto to cancel his visit, and to respond with greater fortitude to the perceived menace from President Trump. On Twitter, Mr. Trump’s action was referred to by politicians and historians as a “an offense to Mexico,” a “slap in the face” and a “monument to lies. ” Historians said that not since President Calvin Coolidge threatened to invade a “Soviet Mexico” had the United States so deeply antagonized the Mexican populace. “It is an unprecedented moment for the bilateral relationship,” said Genaro Lozano, a professor at the Iberoamerican University in Mexico City. “In the 19th century, we fought a war with the U. S. now we find ourselves in a   war, a commercial one over Nafta and an immigration war due to the measures he just announced. ” The fear of many in Mexico is that Mr. Trump’s remarks will force Mr. Peña Nieto’s hand. While the Mexican president has opted for dialogue over confrontation, the building pressure, and perceived slights, could complicate his agenda. That could ultimately lead to disastrous consequences. With Nafta gone, both countries would be likely to suffer significant damage to their economies, and Mexico could see a sharp decline in foreign investment. The United States, meanwhile, might find its southern neighbor far less willing to cooperate on issues of security. Pressure from the political opposition could also color the Mexican government’s response. During a rally, the leftist politician Andrés Manuel López Obrador asked for Mr. Peña Nieto to appeal to the United Nations and accused Mr. Trump of “violating human rights” and of racism. Mr. López Obrador, who ran a close race against Mr. Peña Nieto for president in 2012, said the actions by Mr. Trump on Wednesday were “a great opportunity for Peña to begin his defense of Mexican immigrants, with steadiness and dignity. ” And while Mexico does not want a war of words  —   or a trade war  —   with Washington, the dynamic has already started to change. In recent days, top government officials said they would be willing to walk away from Nafta if the negotiations did not suit Mexico’s interests. That position was unthinkable even a few months ago. For a new American president, Mr. Trump is both well known in Mexico and widely disliked. His remarks have unified an otherwise fractious country, where corruption, a shaky rule of law and economic struggles have alienated many and kept them from becoming politically engaged. As Mr. Trump’s promises have begun to materialize into action, the public discourse is changing. Some fear the worst. “Diplomatic relations are ever changing, never static, but there is a real concern that this wall, as a powerful symbol of national resolve, will unleash a blunt, raw nationalism in Mexico,” said Allert   a professor of international relations at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. “It would be similar to the one the American government is showing, and would undermine all efforts for the relations to go back to their normal state. ” The Trump broadside on Wednesday, coming as the Mexican foreign minister, Luis Videgaray, was to begin preliminary talks in Washington, was a new low in bilateral relations. Mr. Videgaray orchestrated Mr. Trump’s visit to Mexico during the campaign last year, when he was finance minister. The move drew such widespread condemnation that Mr. Videgaray resigned. After Mr. Trump’s victory, Mr. Videgaray’s fortunes revived and he became foreign minister. But any hope that his invitation to Washington could be leveraged in Mexico’s favor now seem dashed. Many Mexicans said conciliatory gestures were no longer an option. “It’s like we are Charlie Brown and they are Lucy with the football,” said Jorge Castañeda, a former foreign minister. “Peña is a weak president in a weak country at a weak moment, but he has to find a way to get some official backbone. ” Still, despite the outrage, there was a recognition that the action was more political than substantive, like the wall itself. A meaningful stretch of the United States border is already lined with a wall, and illegal immigration persists. “Symbolic gestures are not going to change the fact that we’re neighbors and that our countries will affect each other in perpetuity,” said Carlos Pascual, a former United States ambassador to Mexico. “We have no choice but to keep working for better solutions. ” Others took talk of a wall with a grain of salt, figuring Mexican creativity, or ingenuity, would render it useless anyway. “This is just politics, it won’t upend life in Mexico,” said Ariel Najum, 39, who runs a family business. “You know how Mexicans are: If they go high, we go underneath, with tunnels. ”"

Fresno Bee Mocked Fears of Radical Islamic Terror in February - Breitbart,"The Fresno Bee reprinted a column by the New York Times‘ Nicholas Kristof belittling fears of radical Islamic terror  —   almost exactly two months before Tuesday’s deadly shooting attack in the city by a man shouting “Allahu Akbar. ”  In a column published Feb. 17, under the headline, “Husbands are deadlier than jihadi terrorists,” Kristof wrote: It’s true that American Muslims  —   both born in the United States and immigrants from countries other than those subject to Trump’s restrictions  —   have carried out deadly terrorism in America. There have been 123 such murders since the   attacks  —   and 230, 000 other murders. Last year Americans were less likely to be killed by Muslim terrorists than for being Muslim, according to Charles Kurzman of the University of North Carolina. The former is a risk of approximately one in 6 million the latter, one in 1 million. The bottom line is that most years in the United States, ladders kill far more Americans than Muslim terrorists do. Same with bathtubs. Ditto for stairs. And lightning. Above all, fear spouses: Husbands are incomparably more deadly in America than jihadi terrorists. Kristof also attacked Trump aide Sebastian Gorka, a former Breitbart News editor, for being focused on the threat of Islamic terror. The main thrust of Kristof’s criticism was of Trump’s policy of “extreme vetting” of refugees from several   countries in the Muslim world. Instead of terrorism, what Americans ought to fear, Kristof argued, is the proliferation of legal firearms in the country, which he argued had killed well over one million Americans from 1975 to 2015, while   terrorists in the countries under scrutiny had killed none on American goal. (Kristof did not count attempted, but thwarted, attacks.) Three were killed in Tuesday’s attack. The suspect is    Kori Ali Muhammad, who was already wanted in connection with an earlier shooting. He allegedly targeted white people in particular for murder.  "

Winning start for Mourinho and Ibrahimovic," (CNN) Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored on his English Premier League debut as Jose Mourinho’s Manchester United made a winning start to its campaign at Bournemouth Sunday. The Swedish international striker was one of Mourinho’s key summer signings after taking charge at Old Trafford and after scoring the winner in last weekend’s FA Community Shield clash against Leicester grabbed the third in the   win at the Vitality Stadium. Ibrahimovic has previously scored on league debuts for Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona and Paris   striking home from just outside the penalty area with a low shot. United was already   ahead after goals either side of half time from Juan Mata and Wayne Rooney.  Adam Smith hit a late consolation for the home side, who woke up too late in its EPL opener. Another acquisition, Henrikh Mkhitaryan from Borussia Dortmund, also made his debut as a second half replacement for Mata, but record signing Paul Pogba had to sit it out after picking up two bookings for previous club Juventus. Mata, rumored to be surplus to requirements at United, was preferred to start by Mourinho and justified his inclusion by taking advantage of a double blunder from home defender Simon Francis. First his backpass saw Mata reach the ball ahead of home goalkeeper Artur Boruc, then the rebound hit Francis to leave the Spanish midfielder with the simplest of chances to score on 40 minutes. It was the first significant action of a scrappy half and the standard did not improve greatly after the break, with Rooney putting the visitors further ahead just before the hour. It was hardly a classic, Antonio Valencia crossing for Anthony Martial to scuff his shot that fortunately bounced up for Rooney to steer a clever header past Boruc. Ibrahimovic’s sweetly struck effort soon afterwards injected a bit of quality, but the goal of the game came from Smith after fine work from Lewis Grabban. David de Gea was called into late action in the United goal as Bournemouth started to show the type of form that helped them survive its first season in the EPL, but the three points was never in doubt. Mourinho said after the match that ”everything” about the United performance pleased him but would also have been delighted by the solid debut at the back of another new boy Eric Bailly from Villarreal. Later Sunday saw a   thriller at the Emirates where Liverpool beat home side Arsenal  . Arsenal took the lead through Theo Walcott, who had seen an earlier penalty saved before Jurgen Klopp’s visitors hit back in devastating style to lead  . Brazilian Philippe Coutinho was instrumental in the comeback, equalizing with a trademark free kick just before the interval. Coutinho was involved as Adam Lallana put put Liverpool ahead before Coutinho added his second and a third from close range after a   movement. Summer signing Sadio Mane appeared to have made the three points safe with a surging run and shot for   until Arsene Wenger’s side made a belated comeback. Substitute Alex   scored in similar style to Mane, but with Simon Mignolet at fault, before Calum Chambers headed in a third. It added some gloss on a home display which had home fans chanting ”you don’t know what you are doing” in the direction of Wenger, reminiscent of last season’s opening day defeat. The opening day of the season saw a shock defeat for last season’s surprise champions Leicester City. Visiting promoted and managerless Hull City, Leicester was beaten   the first time a reigning champion had been beaten in a season opener since Arsenal at Manchester United in 1989. Adama Diomande put Hull ahead before Riyad Mahrez leveled from the penalty spot at the start of the second half after Demarai Gray had been fouled. Hull grabbed a vital three points when Robert Snodgrass drilled home his shot after after a poor clearance. Who win win the EPL this season? Make your predictions on our CNN Sport Facebook page"
GOP congressman says Spicer ’needs to go’ after Hitler comments,"Aurora, Colorado (CNN) White House press secretary Sean Spicer ”needs to go” in the fallout of his comments about Adolf Hitler, Rep. Mike Coffman of Colorado said Wednesday night. In doing so, Coffman appeared to become the first Republican member of Congress to publicly call for Spicer’s ouster. Coffman, a moderate representing a swing district in and around Aurora, was asked at a town hall about Spicer’s remarks this week that even Hitler didn’t ”sink to using chemical weapons” during the Holocaust. He made the remarks while discussing Syria’s Bashar   and a recent chemical attack that killed dozens in the country.  The pointed question to Coffman came from a woman who said her   died in Auschwitz. ”What is your thoughts at this time of a president who has   people in his Cabinet?” she asked. She wanted Coffman’s reaction to the fact that Spicer made reference to a ”Holocaust center” and suggested that ”Hitler didn’t use gas on his own people.”    ”I need to hear from my congressman that these things are unacceptable,” the woman said.  ”Spicer made a terrible mistake yesterday. If you’re not familiar with what he did is that he. ..” Coffman began to say, but the audience made clear that it didn’t want to hear excuses.  Throwing up his hands, Coffman said: ”He needs to go.”  Spicer has repeatedly apologized for his comments, calling them ”inexcusable and reprehensible.”"
"New Emails Show Clinton Aides Worried About Security, Frustrated with Her Habits - Breitbart","The latest trove of Hillary Clinton emails released by Citizens United reveals that the former Secretary of State’s top aides were well aware her email practices were a security risk. There are also some new exchanges showing Clinton aide Huma Abedin dealing with Clinton Foundation issues while working from the State Department. [During Clinton’s trip to Russia in October 2009, Abedin emailed others at the State Department to let them know the Secretary and her staff would not be carrying their Blackberries, which were patched into the   ClintonEmail. com homebrew server. As Fox News reports:  “Want to make sure DC is aware that those of us in the Russia traveling party will be leaving blackberries on the airplane once we tough down in moscow tonite [sic],” Abedin wrote. When an aide noted that her clintonemail. com address should work if Russian officials are taking their BlackBerrys away, Abedin responded: “Its for security reasons. I don’t want to use that one either. ” Politico adds that Abedin forwarded a similar   to “top Clinton Foundation official Doug Band and others, including Hannah Richert, a director at the Clinton Presidential Center Oscar Flores, manager of the Clintons’ Chappaqua, New York, home Jon Davidson, Bill Clinton’s deputy chief of staff and Justin Cooper, an aide to the former president whose name is registered as the owner of Clinton’s personal server. ” Fox News describes another email chain from September 2009, in which Abedin was forwarded a message about campaign donor Geri Shapiro, who was refusing to attend a Clinton Global Initiative event, because her husband couldn’t attend. Using her State Department email, Abedin asked, “Why was she invited in the first place?” Abedin and another Clinton aide, Cheryl Mills, had an illuminating email conversation in April 2009 in which they expressed frustration with their boss’s email habits. “Personally, I think it’s outrageous that staff go straight to her on this stuff,” said Abedin, referring to someone who emailed Clinton to ask about a job. “This is unbelievable, and she also should not be giving her email to everyone  —     she will get stuff like this,” said Mills. Fox News reports Abedin went on to complain about messages being automatically forwarded from Clinton’s old Senate email account, and also about Clinton’s tendency to carry her unsecure Blackberry with her everywhere she went, even into the shower. Now that we know ClintonEmail. com was improperly handling sensitive classified documents, those are some   gripes from Abedin. It’s also funny to hear aides describing Clinton as a BlackBerry junkie, when her efforts to spin the email scandal away have so often involved her acting like a technology neophyte  —   someone who thinks “wiping a server” refers to cleaning the cabinet down with a cloth, to cite one notorious example. “These   Hillary Clinton emails  —   that are clearly    —   give us a sense of what might be in the 15, 000 emails the FBI discovered that will be released in September. The American people want to know how many of these emails are related to Clinton Foundation business,” Citizens United president David Bossie told the New York Post, following the latest disclosures."
Border Patrol Nabs Previously Deported Killer Crossing Border,"U. S. Border Patrol agents in southern California arrested a previously convicted and deported killer shortly after he illegal   the country from Mexico. [Agents from the Calexico Station in the San Diego Sector encountered a    Mexican national near the Calexico West Port of Entry on Thursday night. The agents observed the man running northward from the International Border fence, according to information obtained by Breitbart Texas from U. S. Customs and Border Protection officials.  The Border Patrol agents caught up with the man and interviewed him. During the interview, it was determined determined the man had illegally crossed the border from Mexico. They arrested him and took him to the Calexico Border Patrol Station for processing. A background records check on the Mexican national revealed he had previously been convicted in the United States for voluntary manslaughter and weapons charges. The convictions earned the man a   prison sentence in the State of California prison system. He was deported from the United States in 2012. “While carrying out our duties as Border Patrol agents, we sometimes encounter dangerous individuals with prior criminal histories attempting to enter the country illegally,” Acting Special Operations Supervisor Miguel Garcia said in a written statement. “This arrest shows how we strive to ensure the safety and   of our community while also enforcing immigration laws. ” The Mexican national now faces additional criminal prosecution for felony   After Removal as a convicted felon. The frequent   of previously deported criminal aliens reported by Breitbart Texas, including violent felons, child rapists, and other sex offenders, reveals the need to better secure the border to prevent such crossings. Earlier this month, a Mexican national who had been deported five times returned yet again to allegedly begin a series of violent assaults and rapes of women in Austin, Texas. Federal prosecutors from the Western District of Texas declined to prosecute the man for illegal   despite a request for prosecution from Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from Enforcement Removal Operations. The man had been deported four times at that point for three DUI offenses. That failure to prosecute and the resulting assaults and rapes are now part of a probe by members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees.

I’m Gay And I’ve Been Banned From San Francisco! - Breitbart,"In the course of my Dangerous Faggot tour, I’ve had my fair share of bans  …     but here’s one I didn’t see coming. I’ve been banned from San Francisco! Me, the gayest person on the planet. Banned. From San Francisco, the queerest city in America. [Apparently I’m just too dangerous of a faggot, even for a city that pumps AZT directly into the water. Alas,   will not become the new San Francisco treat any time soon. Okay, so in truth I wasn’t banned from the entire city  —   though that’s surely only a matter of time. Just The Chapel restaurant and event space in Mission District, which cancelled a planned Breitbart meetup after learning of my attendance. The owner said I was the “biggest problem” at the event, and that he had concerns about the venue’s capacity. He’s right, of course. My fans would have mobbed the place. I rarely talk to audiences of less than 500 these days. Sorry about it! The venue owner’s comments to the San Francisco Chronicle suggest that he wasn’t just motivated by concerns about my huge, enormous, giant, really just colossal numbers of fans, but also by good old San Francisco values. “I’m not about a culture of hate” said the owner, who told the Chronicle that he “wasn’t aware” of Breitbart’s “reputation” when he made the booking. I’m not surprised. If there are any conservatives left in San Francisco, I expect they have to wear rainbow flags, plaid shirts, or jockstraps just to blend in. Besides serving as the biggest gay hub outside of Miami International Airport’s men’s rooms (Hi Marco!) the city is the most barkingly mad center of wacky progressivism in the U. S, and quite possibly the world. The city has a fetish for banning things (among many other weird fetishes, some of which are OK I guess). Things that are currently unwelcome in San Francisco: McDonalds Happy Meals, Segways, plastic bags, soda vending machines, and gay people with opinions. The city is so   it’s even banned the depiction of firearms in adverts on municipally owned advertising space. Perhaps San Francisco was just paying attention to my new workout regime, and were afraid my own pair would be a bad influence. ”@MAurelius161180: @Nero Damn, Milo, how many guns did you shoot today?”     A couple boo pic. twitter.   —   Milo Yiannopoulos ✘ (@Nero) March 13, 2016,  While stomping on my free speech, the venue owner insisted that he supported free speech. “I’m in favor of free speech” he said. “But this is not about free speech. ” It’s certainly true that San Francisco isn’t entirely opposed to extreme speech. Just look at some of the lovely people who are allowed to demonstrate on their streets.     So as you can see, San Francisco is a bastion of free speech  —   provided you have the right opinions. It’s little wonder that companies like Twitter and Facebook, based in San Francisco, are so rapidly descending into the wacky politics of social justice, censorship, and blatant  . We don’t really need boycotts to solve Silicon Valley’s   bias. We just need to take the entire tech industry and move it to a small town in Oklahoma.

Birth Control Causes Depression? Not So Fast - The New York Times,"One of the biggest American public health victories of the last decade has been the record low reached in the teenage birthrate. Along with that have been lows in rates for teenage pregnancy and abortion. Most researchers believe that improved access to contraception is a large part of this success. But news continues to focus on the concern that   contraception  —   like the pill or the patch  —   causes depression, and that this should lead us to question its wider use. A more nuanced discussion would consider both the benefits and the harms. This issue drew widespread coverage at the end of last year with a large study published in JAMA Psychiatry. Researchers tracked all women and adolescent females (ages 15 to 34) living in Denmark from 2000 through 2014. The study found that those who used hormonal contraception had significantly higher risks of also taking an antidepressant. The study broke down the increased relative risk for each hormonal method this way: combined oral contraceptives (23 percent)   pills (34 percent) the patch (100 percent) vaginal ring (60 percent) and levonorgestrel intrauterine system (40 percent). The risks were highest in adolescents and decreased as women aged. The risks also peaked six months after the start of contraception. Needless to say, many news outlets covered this finding widely. Some portrayed it as shocking new information that should change the way we think about hormonal birth control. Others saw it as a vindication of many women who said for years that birth control had triggered their depression while scientists and doctors ignored them. But we have to acknowledge the limitations of this type of research. It’s not a controlled trial, and it’s impossible to establish causality. Women who choose to have sex could also be more likely to consider antidepressant use. Women who are plugged in enough to the health care system to obtain hormonal contraception could be more likely to have their depression appropriately diagnosed and treated  —   which is a good thing. It’s also possible that an antidepressant prescription isn’t the best measure of   depression. That would require an actual diagnosis by a health care professional, and such data were not available in the Danish cohort. Previous studies that looked at rates of severe depression did not find a correlation with hormonal birth control use. Finally, huge cohort studies using many participants are likely to find a statistically significant result even if that result is not clinically significant. This is especially true if the cohort data come from an administrative database, like the one used in this study, that has been specifically identified as problematic in prior publications. We also have to place this study in context with others. Months earlier, a systematic review of all studies that looked at the relationship between hormonal contraception and depression was published in The European Journal of Contraception and Reproductive Health Care. The authors first noted that there were too few prospective studies. But the data that do exist show that most women don’t show any effect from hormonal birth control, or actually had their mood improve. Adverse effects were rare, and even rarer when the contraception contained lower levels of the hormone progestin. Finally, women who have underlying mood disorders were more predisposed to have   side effects, but that could be related to their choosing different types of birth control rather than the birth control itself. When many studies do not find a connection, and then one does, that latter one does not “replace” all prior research. That study has to be weighed along with the rest. It’s also important to consider publication bias, in which a study is more likely to be published if it’s a “significant” result and if it’s newsy. In this case, the finding that common birth control causes depression is both. But let us assume, for the sake of argument, that this most recent finding is both real and causal. Even then, we need to rely on absolute risks, not relative risks. In the Denmark study, for every 100 women who didn’t use hormonal birth control, 1. 7 were later prescribed an antidepressant. For every 100 who did use hormonal birth control, 2. 2 were later prescribed an antidepressant. The overall difference (0. 5 percentage points) means that if this were a randomized controlled trial, we would expect that for every 200 women treated, one extra woman might need to be treated with an antidepressant. We can also assume, though, that pretty much all of them would receive the benefit of birth control in family planning. Moreover, lest anyone forget, depression is also significantly associated with pregnancy, especially when that pregnancy is unintended. None of this is to say that we should ignore the risk of depression. Depression is a listed side effect of birth control it’s on the package inserts. All drugs have side effects. The drug I take for my ulcerative colitis has a real, if small, risk of causing myelosuppression. But the benefits I receive from it simply outweigh the risks. Women need to discuss with their physicians the potential downsides, as well as the potential upsides, of all forms of contraception. We shouldn’t ignore the potential for hormonal birth control to cause mood changes in women. We also shouldn’t pay attention only to those side effects, forgetting to place them in context with the benefits."
NY Bombing Suspect ’Not on a U.S. Terror Watch List’ - Breitbart,"Captured New York City and New Jersey bombing suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami was “not on a U. S. terror watch list” nor a list maintained by the NYPD. [Although Rahami is suspected of ties to a bombing  —   rather than a   attack  —   it is worth noting that his alleged example represents a larger, consistent pattern of attackers who would not be stopped by the inclusion of terror watch lists     lists in gun control. In this way, Rahami is reminiscent of the gunman who killed 49 during the June 12 Orlando terror attack and the terrorists who killed 14 in San Bernardino, as none of these attackers were on a terror watch list.  According to ABC 7, Rahami was taken into custody after a shootout with police in Linden, New Jersey. Linden Mayor Derek Armstead said: At approximately 10:30 this morning, the owner of one of the establishments in town reported that there was an individual sleeping in his hallway. One of our police officers went to investigate, to wake him up, and realized that he was the suspect that has been sought in the other bombings that had occurred prior  …     He realized it was the suspect, and within moments, the suspect had fired on him. And thank God that he had his vest on. I think that saved his life. CNBC reported that “the FBI said that Rahami was not on a U. S. terrorist watch list or NYPD list. ” Therefore, although there has been no announcement on how Rahami obtained the gun he used to shoot at police, it is certain that adding the terror watch list to background checks would not have prevented him from obtaining one. Just as it would not have prevented the Orlando attacker and the San Bernardino attackers from obtaining the guns they used.

5 Ways to Be a Better Tourist - The New York Times,"American tourists are numerous, relatively affluent and culturally distinct enough that tour guides in other lands often receive special training to know how best to accommodate them. But the guide trainers say there are some basic ways that Americans can be better guests when taking tours abroad. Generally, that means being open to new experiences and asking more questions about the culture you’re visiting rather than talking about your own. There are specific steps, too. Learn a few of the most common words or phrases. “Hello,” “excuse me,” “thank you” and “goodbye” are common courtesies that you should learn and use in the local language. Even if you mispronounce the words, it’s the gesture that counts. Watch your body language. Customs vary widely, but how and whether you point or beckon can potentially offend, and in the Muslim world the left hand is reserved for bathroom hygiene. Some societies keep eyes downcast as a sign of respect, especially with elders, making an American’s direct gaze feel awkward to tour guides. Do your homework ahead of time about such things before visiting a country or culturally distinct region for the first time. Dress appropriately for the society or site you are visiting. If you are unsure, do a little research beforehand, taking cues from the way the locals dress. In many places, women would do well to carry a large scarf to cover the head or shoulders, if necessary  —   particularly in sites of religious significance. Be a considerate photographer. Don’t monopolize the best vantage points, or cause the tour to fall behind schedule as you play Ansel Adams. And limit use of selfie sticks, which can be particularly annoying. Leave a “little something. ” Even in countries where tipping is not part of the culture, it is widely known that Americans do tip. To not do so could be perceived as a specific slight. And many workers, especially in   areas, count on it."
"A Bigger Economic Pie, but a Smaller Slice for Half of the U.S. - The New York Times","Even with all the setbacks from recessions, burst bubbles and vanishing industries, the United States has still pumped out breathtaking riches over the last three and half decades. The real economy more than doubled in size the government now uses a substantial share of that bounty to hand over as much as $5 trillion to help working families, older people, disabled and unemployed people pay for a home, visit a doctor and put their children through school. Yet for half of all Americans, their share of the total economic pie has shrunk significantly, new research has found. This group  —   the approximately 117 million adults stuck on the lower half of the income ladder  —   “has been completely shut off from economic growth since the 1970s,” the team of economists found. “Even after taxes and transfers, there has been close to zero growth for   adults in the bottom 50 percent. ” The new findings, by the economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, provide the most thoroughgoing analysis to date of how the income kitty  —   like paychecks,   fringe benefits and food stamps  —   is divided among the American population. Stagnant wages have sliced the share of income collected by the bottom half of the population to 12. 5 percent in 2014, from 20 percent of the total in 1980. Where did that money go? Essentially, to the top 1 percent, whose share of the nation’s income nearly doubled to more than 20 percent during that same   period. Inequality has been a defining national issue for nearly a decade, thanks in part to groundbreaking research done by Mr. Piketty at the Paris School of Economics and Mr. Saez at the University of California, Berkeley. But now a new administration in Washington is promising to reshape the government’s role in curbing the intense concentration of wealth at the top and improving the fortunes of those left behind. During his tenure in the White House, President Obama pushed to address income stagnation by shifting more of the tax burden from the middle class to the rich and expanding public programs like universal health insurance. Both strategies are now targeted by   Donald J. Trump and Republicans in Congress, led by House Speaker Paul Ryan. Like many conservatives, Mr. Ryan argues that aid to the poor is ultimately counterproductive because it undermines the incentive to work. Proposals put forward by Republican leaders, though short on details, make clear that they want to roll back benefits like Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, which primarily help the poor, and direct the largest tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans. About 30 percent of the country’s income is channeled to federal, state and local taxes. Apart from military spending and performing basic public services, much of that is distributed back to individuals through various programs and tax benefits in the form of Social Security checks, Medicare benefits and veterans’ benefits. But until now, no one has truly measured the full impact that tax payments, government spending, noncash benefits and nontaxable income together have on inequality. Abundant documentation of income inequality already exists, but it has been challenged as incomplete. Studies have excluded the impact of taxes and value of public benefits, skeptics complained, or failed to account for the smaller size of households over time. This latest project tries to address those earlier criticisms. What the trio of economists found is that the spectacular growth in incomes at the peak has so outpaced the small increase at the bottom from public programs intended to ameliorate poverty and inequality that the gap between the wealthiest and everyone else has continued to widen. Average incomes, adjusted for inflation, grew by 61 percent from 1980 to 2014. But nearly $7 out of every additional $10 went to those in the top tenth of the income scale. Inequality has soared over that period. In 1980, the researchers found, someone in the top 1 percent earned on average the equivalent of $428, 200 a year in 2014 dollars  —   about 27 times more than the typical person in the bottom half, whose annual income equaled $16, 000. By 2014, the average income of half of American adults had barely budged, remaining around $16, 000, while members of the top 1 percent brought home, on average, $1, 304, 800 or 81 times as much. That ratio, the authors point out, “is similar to the gap between the average income in the United States and the average income in the world’s poorest countries, the   Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic and Burundi. ” The growth of incomes has probably increased a bit since 2014, the latest year for which full data exists, said Mr. Zucman, who, like Mr. Saez, also teaches at the University of California, Berkeley. But it is “not enough to make any significant difference to our   finding, and in particular, to affect the   stagnation of    incomes. ” He was to present the findings at a   workshop at the City University of New York on Tuesday. Tax credits and programs like Medicare and disability payments have helped families at the lower half of the income scale. But they have just nipped at the heels of the underlying trend. “It confirms the surge in income at the top,” said Raj Chetty, an economist at Stanford unaffiliated with the project, who called the work “terrific and very important. And it shows government redistribution doesn’t really change the picture. ” Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard who also independently reviewed the research, agreed that the data underscored the inadequacies of programs that try to redress inequities after the fact. “It suggests that if you don’t do something earlier in the market, before distribution, through better education or greater bargaining power, it’s really tough to offset completely,” Mr. Katz said. “Countries with less inequality do some of both. ” Mr. Katz and Claudia Goldin, a Harvard economist, have argued that advances in technology, while crucial to improving productivity and generating economic growth, also have exacerbated inequality by driving down wages of   workers. The rewards of education are greater than they have ever been, but advancement nationwide has slowed and the system confers many of its favors on the children of the affluent. If there is a bright spot in the new comprehensive research, it is that after taxes and government spending, the middle class is in better shape than previous studies had shown. That earlier research had missed growth in nontaxable income like employee benefits. “The real income of the middle class is a bit better than we thought,” Mr. Katz said. As troubling as some may find inequality, it is not necessarily the fault of a rigged system, said N. Gregory Mankiw, an economist at Harvard who is familiar with the new research. He argues that large disparities in income more often than not accurately reflect widely varying economic contributions. “Inequality is a symptom of a variety of things,” Mr. Mankiw said. Technological progress may be a cause, but it benefits society over all, whereas the weakness of the educational system is clearly negative. Edward Conard, the author of “The Upside of Inequality” and a former business partner of Mitt Romney, agreed. “People say this is   game, and you’re taking money that would have gone to the other 50 percent,” he said. “That’s not what happened. ” Instead, Mr. Conard said, entrepreneurs in the United States have been willing to take big risks that have helped foster an infrastructure that promotes innovation, not just in Silicon Valley but in many other growing places around the country. “When rewards go up, people are more inclined to take risks,” he said. Some of those risks pay off and create wealth for everyone. The new research challenges that contention, at least in part. Mr. Piketty, Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman concluded that the main driver of wealth in recent years has been investment income at the top. That is a switch from the 1980s and 1990s, when gains in income were primarily generated by working. That divergence can slow innovation and further entrench inequities, said Heather Boushey, an economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. When labor income provides the primary route to riches, it creates incentives for people to improve their education and work harder, Ms. Boushey explained. But if getting ahead requires already having a stockpile of cash or inheriting a windfall from your parents, then it is much harder to work your way up. “If you’re closing off entryways, then you are basically shutting off avenues to competitiveness, innovation and growth,” Ms. Boushey said, “even if you don’t care about fairness. ”"
Australia to ban convicted pedophiles from traveling abroad ," (CNN) Australia will introduce tough new laws in an attempt to crack down on child sex tourism in what the government has described as a ”world first.”  In a statement, the Australian government said the new rules would ensure child sex offenders cannot travel ”to vulnerable countries where they are out of sight and reach of Australian law.”  There are around 20, 000 registered child sex offenders in Australia who have served their sentences but are still under supervision and subject to reporting obligations.  Almost 800 traveled overseas in 2016, with more than one third doing so without permission, the statement said. ”Australia is leading the way when it comes to protecting vulnerable children overseas,” Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told reporters.  The new laws, she said, would prevent convicted Australian pedophiles taking part in the ”growing child sex tourism trade.”  ”This is the strongest crackdown on child sex tourism ever. No country has ever taken such decisive and strong action to stop its citizens from going overseas, often to vulnerable countries, to abuse kids,” said Justice Minister Michael Keenan. ”We know that we’ll be denying passports to around 20, 000 people who currently have reporting obligations . .. and about 2, 500 will be added every year and we will continue to deny them passports whilst they have those reporting obligations.” Pervasive problem, According to EPCAT, an NGO which campaigns against child sex tourism, there are more than two dozen countries where child sex tourism is prevalent, with the worst affected locations in South America and Southeast Asia.  UNICEF estimates two million children globally are effected by sexual exploitation every year, and the child sex trade is worth around $20 billion annually.  In 2016, an investigation by Australian police led to the arrest of British pedophile Richard Huckle, who posed as a Christian English teacher to groom and abuse children, including one as young as 6 months, throughout Southeast Asia.  A recent EPCAT report warned the problem has ”expanded across the globe and   every attempt to respond at the international and national level.”  ”In an increasingly interconnected world, more people are on the move and even the most remote parts of the planet are now within reach, thanks to cheaper travel and the spread of the internet. As a result, the risks of child sexual exploitation are increasing,” the report said. "
"Exclusive-Roger Stone: In Speech Trump Must Stick to Agenda, Make One Good Reference to ’Fake News’ - Breitbart","The   man in American politics and one of the political mentors of President Donald Trump told Breitbart News Monday the president needs to stay focused on his program in his first address to a joint session of Congress. [“He needs to stick to the agenda,” said Roger Stone, who was one of the first advisers to join Trump’s campaign and remains one of his closest confidantes.  “Avoid    with his critics  —   just stick to the agenda  —   and make at least one good reference to fake news,” Stone said. Less than two months in, Stone said he is impressed by Trump’s performance in the White House. “I think he is doing great. ” Stone spoke to Breitbart News at a   book signing for his latest work: The Making of the President 2016: How Donald Trump Orchestrated a Revolution at Washington’s   Hotel. The diverse crowd of   men of influence, conservative operatives, and Capitol Hill staffers was a pretty strong signal that it is very important in Washington that Stone knows you bought his book. The event was organized by David Urban, the man who led Trump’s campaign in Pennsylvania. “Roger’s always been on the cutting edge,” Urban said. “He is always the guy you want on your team and I think the president was glad to have him on the team this year. ” Standing under a portrait of Lincoln’s trusted aide and biographer John Hay, Stone told the crowd that one of the insights in his book about the 2016 campaign is its similarity to the 1948 race between Republican New York Gov. Thomas Dewey and President Harry Truman. “The more I thought about it, Hillary Clinton is really Tom Dewey without the mustache: Cold, aloof, overconfident,” he said. “While Trump is barnstorming Democratic strongholds in Michigan and Wisconsin and Western Pennsylvania  —   Hillary’s in Chappaqua in her pajamas looking at the swatches to pick out fabric for her Oval Office curtains,” he said. Like Truman, Trump is a closer, he said. “Donald Trump is the greatest closer in American politics,” he said. “It was really a Herculean, superhuman effort. He drove himself  —   largely without sleep  —   on the basis of good data that said we could expand the map, we could win Michigan, we could win Wisconsin, we could win Pennsylvania and thus elect a man that I believe is destined to be one of our greatest presidents. ” Stone, who was a White House aide to President Richard Nixon and later introduced Nixon to Trump, told Breitbart News: “Both Nixon and Trump have obvious advantages and nobody is perfect, everyone has a flaw, but in terms of his intelligence, in terms of his speaking out for people who have been forgotten within our system, in terms of his executive ability, and in terms of his toughness and his pragmatism  —   n all those ways he is like Nixon. ” Like Nixon, Trump is going to figure how to deal with the Washington and Republican establishments. “I did look at a White House staff list yesterday and I had to stop myself  —   I actually recognized a name,” he said. “His greatest danger is not from the liberal Democrats. It’s from establishment Republicans, who like the status quo and might seek to undermine his program  —   unless of course, they determine that their program is so popular that they better get on board quick and claim they were for it the whole time. ”"
Texas hasn’t had a day without a traffic fatality in over 15 years for 2 main reasons,"’This calendar is published by the Texas Department of Transportation as part of its traffic safety efforts.

Brent Bozell Calls on Univision to Drop Jorge Ramos,"Media Research Center president Brent Bozell called on Univision to remove Jorge Ramos from his position after the Latino anchor called on fellow journalists to end their impartial coverage of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in an   published in Time Magazine and an appearance Thursday night on Fox News’s Kelly File. [“By deciding to openly take sides and urging all journalists to be as unethical as he is in his coverage of this year’s U. S. presidential election, Univision anchor Jorge Ramos has rendered himself incapable of serving as a credible, impartial news anchor for Univision’s millions of viewers,” Bozell said in a statement.  “At the very least, Univision should remove Ramos from the network’s national evening news anchor chair, from now through Election Day. If Jorge Ramos has any sense left of professional integrity, he should tender his resignation and pursue his new passion, as an     political activist,” the MRC head added. “It doesn’t matter who you are —  a journalist, a politician or a voter —  we’ll all be judged by how we responded to Donald Trump. Like it or not, this election is a plebiscite on the most divisive, polarizing and disrupting figure in American politics in decades. And neutrality is not an option,” Ramos wrote in an   published in Time Magazine on Tuesday. He   on his highly partisan   position with Megyn Kelly on her Fox News program Thursday night: Kelly:  Now he’s [Jorge Ramos] getting attention for calling on his fellow journalists to drop their impartiality when it comes to candidate Trump, writing, “It doesn’t matter who you are —  a journalist, a politician, or a voter, we’ll all be judged by how we responded to Donald Trump. What do you mean by that? Because you come out specifically and say neutrality is not an option, even for journalists. Explain. Ramos: I think neutrality’s not an option when you watch as a journalist are confronted with racism, discrimination, corruption, public lies, dictatorship, or violations of human rights. I think Edward R. Murrow and Walter Cronkite got it right. There are certain instances in which you have to take a stand. Ramos said that Kelly herself had taken a stand when she asked Trump about remarks he had made about women at a fall debate of GOP candidates hosted by Fox News. But Kelly disagreed with that assessment. “That was me asking a question. I identified an issue, and thought it worthy of a question. It wasn’t ‘Here’s what Megyn Kelly thinks of you,’ ” she said. On his partisan stand against Trump, Ramos told Kelly: It is not exactly an opinion. I don’t know if Donald Trump is a racist. I don’t know what’s in his head, but I do know what’s coming out of his mouth. And when he says that Mexican immigrants are criminals, rapists, and drug traffickers, that’s a racist remark. When he says that a judge, simply because of his ethnic heritage, cannot be part of a case simply because of that, simply because he’s Latino, that’s a racist remark. And I think we as journalists, we have to call it out. Maybe Donald Trump doesn’t consider himself a racist but 73 percent of Latinos think that he is. Newsbusters noted that “Kelly however called out Ramos a bit, asking if he discloses the fact that his daughter Paolo Ramos has ‘a working position,’ within the Hillary Clinton campaign whenever he covers an aspect of the election. ” They went on: “Is this personal for you, in that way?” she pressed. “I’ve disclosed that many, many times  …     in other words, that’s [Paolo’s] decision, and I have absolutely nothing to do with that,” Ramos concluded. Ramos notes that he had published a note on the Univision website identifying the younger Ramos’ connection to Clinton. “We maintain that, in part, through transparency with our audience, our colleagues and our critics,” he wrote in June on the matter. In his Time Magazine   Ramos completely shed any pretense of objectivity in his reporting on Trump: Regardless of whether Donald Trump wins or loses, we will be asked on November 9th: What did you do? Did you support him? Were you brave enough, ethical enough, to challenge him when he insulted immigrants, Muslims, women, war heroes and people with disabilities? Are you on the record correcting his lies? Did you discuss with your friends and family that in a democracy like ours there is no room for racism and discrimination? Or did you just sit idly, silently, allowing others to decide the future of the United States? Because you will be asked. Trump has forced journalists to revisit rules of objectivity and fairness. Just providing both points of view is not enough in the current presidential campaign. If a candidate is making racist and sexist remarks, we cannot hide in the principle of neutrality. That’s a false equivalence. Ken   MRC’s Latino director, noted that Ramos has a history of using Time Magazine as a venue for his biased political opinions: “Talking with Time magazine back in 2014, Jorge Ramos recognized that ‘with the political positions I have been taking lately, obviously I am running the risk of losing credibility.’ By deciding to openly take sides in this year’s U. S. presidential election, Jorge Ramos now needs to face the full consequences of losing whatever credibility he had left as a journalist,”    said in the MRC statement. “He certainly no longer deserves to be seen by his viewers as an impartial, unaligned and credible source of news,” he added."
ACLU Targets Jeff Sessions Won’t Defend Michael Flynn - Breitbart,"The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) wants the Senate to question Attorney General Jeff Sessions next week about “his own role with Russia, his role in the Comey firing, and the ongoing investigations into ties with Russia and his recusal,” according to a statement by the organization. [Sessions will appear on Tuesday before the Committee on Appropriations to testify about the Department of Justice budget.  The ACLU says that it is “asking its over 2 million supporters to contact their representatives and urge them to ask Sessions tough questions. ” Asked by Breitbart News what the relevance of the Russia investigation was for civil liberties in the United States, Christopher Anders, deputy director of the ACLU’s legislative office, said: “It’s very fundamental to civil liberties, in that it goes right to the heart of our democracy, in our ability to vote, and that our votes are counted and are meaningful. ” Russia’s hacking  —   or its attempt to hack  —   political parties and local voter databases “raises concerns about integrity of voting and integrity of our elections,” Anders said. Asked whether the ACLU had defended former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, whose telephone calls were under surveillance, and whose name was leaked illegally to the media, Anders acknowledged that the organization had not defended him specifically, adding: “We haven’t accused Michael Flynn of anything, either. ” The ACLU had, Anders pointed out, raised the general issue of surveillance, and was concerned about the   of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which is thought to be the provision under which Flynn’s communications were intercepted. “We have said there is a good reason to be concerned,” Anders told Breitbart News. “President Trump is raising a legitimate issue of concern about Americans’ communications being surveilled, and they shouldn’t be, absent a specific warrant. ” In recent months, the ACLU has adopted an aggressive stance against the Trump administration, one very close to the partisan positions of the Democratic Party. It has also organized “Resistance training” workshops for activists opposed to the Trump administration’s policies. Noted civil libertarian Alan Dershowitz wrote last month in the Wall Street Journal: The ACLU was once a nonpartisan organization focused on liberty and equality before the law. In recent years it has chosen its battles with an increasingly   sensibility. In doing so, it has become considerably more equivocal and sometimes even hostile toward core civil liberties concerns of free speech and due process. But Anders defended the group’s record, noting that it had supported Republicans like Sen. Rand Paul ( ) on civil liberties issues, and opposed certain policies of Democratic administrations in the past. He stressed the ACLU’s commitment to defending the Constitution. “That’s what we’re here to do, regardless of who’s in power. ” Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

LGBT Rights Groups Slam Trump Admin Father’s Day Event with Traditional Marriage Advocates - Breitbart,"Gay rights advocates have condemned the Trump education department for inviting groups that advocate for one   woman marriage to a Father’s Day event. [GLAAD and the Human Rights Campaign, which claim to be “inclusive,” slammed The U. S. Education Department for inviting Family Research Council (FRC) and Focus on the Family  —   groups that support traditional marriage  —   to participate in a panel at a Father’s Day event, reports Politico.

"Lockheed CEO Pledges 1,800 New Jobs, Lower F-35 Costs - Breitbart","The CEO of the aerospace defense company Lockheed Martin, Marillyn Hewson, pledges to create an additional 1, 800 jobs and significantly reduce the high cost of   Joint Strike Fighter program previously criticized by   Donald Trump. [“We are going to increase our jobs in Fort Worth by 1, 800 jobs and when you think about the [ ] supply chain across 45 states in the U.

The announcement is another victory for Trump’s promise to bring jobs back to America, with companies promising tens of thousands of additional jobs following his victory. One notable success for the incoming Trump administration was Ford’s announcement last week cancelling its plans to build a new plant in Mexico. Instead, it seeks to invest $700 million in Michigan, creating 700 new jobs in the process. Another piece of good news for Trump was Hewson’s promise to reduce the cost of the   military defense program, designed by Lockheed, which Trump has previously described as having costs that are “out of control. ” The   program and cost is out of control.

Franklin Graham: Donald Trump Won Election by the ‘Hand of God’,"Celebrated evangelical Rev. Franklin Graham says that it was the “hand of God,” rather than Russian hackers, that determined the outcome of November’s presidential election. [“I think maybe God has allowed Donald Trump to win this election to protect this nation for the next few years by giving maybe an opportunity to have some good judges,” he said.  The son of renowned Baptist minister Billy Graham, the Rev. Franklin Graham has been invited by   Trump to be one of six clergy to offer the invocation, benediction, and several readings at his   ceremony on January 20. In an interview with Religion News Service Thursday, Graham said that beyond mere human factors, the mysterious hand of divine providence was at work in the elections. “All I know is Donald Trump was supposed to lose the election” according to all the polls, Graham said. “For these states to go the way they did, in my opinion, I think it was the hand of God,” he said. “It wasn’t hacking. It wasn’t   or whatever. It was God, in my opinion, and I believe his hand was at work, and I think he’s given Christians an opportunity. ” While never officially endorsing Trump, Rev. Graham has been a sharp critic of the Obama administration and a vocal opponent of Hillary Clinton, especially for her uncompromising support of   . Shortly before Election Day, Graham declared that the best choice for president “isn’t difficult to figure out if you are a Christian,” in evident reference to Republican candidate Donald Trump. “There’s two different pictures and two different visions for America,” Graham said in early November. “The Democratic Party has a vision, Hillary Clinton has a vision, Donald Trump has a totally different vision for this nation with the Republican Party. This isn’t difficult to figure out if you are a Christian. ” The evangelist acknowledged that for many, voting for Trump might not have been easy, but he insisted that it was, nonetheless, the better choice and that Trump was a “changed man. ” “You may have to hold your nose and vote,” Graham said. “I have people that say, ‘Well I don’t like Donald Trump, I don’t like what he says.’ Well I don’t like what he said either, I promise I don’t like it. But those are things that he said 11 years ago, not something that he said today. ” “I think Donald Trump has changed,” Graham added. “I think God is working on his heart and in his life. But people have to make up their own mind. ” In a Facebook post some weeks earlier, Graham had stated that “the difference between the candidates is night and day. ” “Some candidates have entire political ads talking about how they spent their career fighting for the rights of children,” he said. “Yet they spent their entire career fighting against the rights of unborn children!” Graham said Hillary Clinton’s progressive agenda was “godless” and could not be defended. Following WikiLeaks revelations, the preacher denounced the “depth of corruption” in Washington politics, calling for its eradication. “WikiLeaks is giving us a much clearer picture of the depth of the corruption that is thriving in our nation’s capital,” Graham wrote, calling it “a swamp that needs to be drained. ” “Our political system is broken, and it will take strong, tough leadership to begin fixing some of this,” Graham said. Regarding the inauguration ceremony, Graham says he still has not decided which Scripture passage to read. “I’m taking time just to pray and ask God to give me wisdom and guidance because it’s a responsibility that I take very seriously,” he said.

ESPN $5.6b Debacle: Football Semifinal Ratings down 32% from 2014 - Breitbart,"The $5. 6 billion New Year’s Eve nightmare continued for ESPN, with Saturday’s games averaging only a 10. 4 rating, down 32 percent from the 15. 4 rating just two years ago. [The Sporting News tried to put the best face on the debacle, noting it was not quite as bad as the 9. 8 in 2015, which was a 36 percent drop from 2014.  ESPN can now only hope the title game next week between Alabama and Clemson goes better than when the same two teams met last year (see Breitbart Sports story, “‘Embarrassing’ for ESPN: More Watch Basketball Title Than Football Championship”). The unheard of event of more Americans watching a basketball game than a football game cast wide concern of the $5. 6 billion in a   deal ESPN penned for the College Football Playoffs. Last year the Sporting News reported ESPN might need to repay $20 million to advertisers due to the low ratings. The low ratings occurred despite the fact that ESPN could not have asked for a luckier draw, as the two games featured the best three fan bases in all of college football (1, Alabama, 2, Ohio State and 3, Clemson) and one of the two biggest fan bases from the west in Washington, according to USA Today’s rankings. Geographically the 32% drop is from an    comparison, as the 2014 playoffs featured the same best two fan bases (Alabama and Ohio State) subbed the other top western fan base (Oregon) and also had the ACC champ (Florida State in 2014 compared to Clemson this year). While sports used to offer Americans a place to get away from political and other divisions to root for a common team, Disney’s ESPN instead chose to use their reach to try to shape a liberal agenda, such as labeling those who referred to the Washington Redskins as racists. They never bothered to ask Native Americans, and when the Washington Post finally did and found 9 in 10 did NOT consider the team name racist, ESPN personality Michael Wilbon said he was “stunned” by the findings of the poll, thinking the majority of Native Americans would be offended, adding that “this shuts the door on the issue” of changing the Redskins’ name. ” (see Breitbart story) Perhaps a return to sports as a safe haven from political attacks and protests would bring back viewers. The speculation that the left wing Disney might sell ESPN in light of the subscriber nosedive, as reported in this Breitbart story, might be the first step to sports programming that is about  —   well  —   sports."
"’Epidemic Alert’: Contagious, Deadly Disease Found Among Migrants","A former luxury   migrant centre in Austria is the site of an outbreak of a deadly bacterial disease which has seen at least one migrant put into intensive care. [The outbreak of   relapsing fever is just the latest   of diseases long thought exterminated in Europe, carried back to the continent by a great migratory movement of millions of people from Africa and Asia. Particularly associated with Ethiopia, Sudan, Eritrea, and Somalia, the extremely contagious bacteria causes severe illness and can be fatal in 30 to 70 per cent of cases, according to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.  If untreated, the disease has a similar fatality rate to that of the 2015 West African Ebola outbreak. Health authorities in Austria reacted immediately to the outbreak, reports Kronen Zeitung. Salzburg chief of public order Dr. Michael Haybäck said of the urgent measures taken to contain the infection: “According to Article 6 of the Law on Epidemics, we take all necessary measures without delay to meet a suspected case”. The luxurious alpine country resort hotel Kobenzl was placed under quarantine, with rooms placed in   and completely disinfected. Given that body lice are the main vector for the disease, the cleaning of mattresses and clothes was given especial priority. Now all migrants living at the hotel will be required to wash their clothes at 60 degrees for the next six weeks, two weeks beyond the approximate life span of an infected louse. The other residents of the hotel are presently being examined to determine whether there are more cases to come, reports Salzburg24, but it is not presently known how many cases have been detected in total. All staff at the centre have been issued with protective disposable clothing for their work with the migrants. Borrelia recurrentis, the bacteria transferred from infected lice to humans which causes Relapsing Fever was a global disease a century ago until it was eradicated in Europe. It ravaged eastern Europe in the immediate aftermath of the Great War and during the Russian revolution, killing five million people from 13 million known cases between 1919 and 1923. Migrants have been credited with a host of other diseases appearing in Europe again, in some cases for the first time in decades. As reported by Breitbart London, European hospitals have seen Diphtheria, Tuberculosis, And Malaria cases in historic numbers in the past year.

Couple indicted in Texas Denny’s chokehold death,"Houston (CNN) A Texas deputy and her husband could face life in prison after a night out for two Texas families turned into a deadly fight.  John Hernandez kicked and gasped for air when a deputy’s husband allegedly had him in a chokehold outside a   Denny’s restaurant, a video shows. Minutes later, the    father was rushed to the hospital and three days later, he was taken off life support. How the attack unfolded is at the center of the criminal case against Terry Thompson and his wife, Harris County Sheriff’s deputy Chauna Thompson.  Thompson’s attorney said Terry was acting in   and that a video that was released does not tell the full story of how the altercation unfolded. The couple was indicted on murder charges after Hernandez’s death was ruled a homicide by the Harris County medical examiner’s office, reported CNN affiliate KTRK.  They were in custody late Thursday night and released on bond early Friday, according to the Harris County Sheriff’s office. What happened? It was just after 11 p. m. on May 28 when Terry Thompson verbally confronted Hernandez for urinating outside a Denny’s restaurant in Northeast Harris County, the sheriff’s office said. ”A physical altercation ensued,” the sheriff’s office said. ”After being confronted with urinating in public, he rushed to my client and struck him in the face. Now, I would consider that an attack,” said Thompson’s attorney, Scot Courtney.   As Thompson, 41, brought Hernandez to the ground, a man walked outside the restaurant and started recording the incident.  A   video shows Thompson on top of Hernandez locking him in a chokehold while his wife, who was off duty, pins Hernandez’s left arm to the ground.   As Hernandez kicks and gasps for air, Thompson tells Hernandez, ”Do you want me to hit you again? Do you want me to hit you again?” Then two unknown people try to block the bystander from recording more of the scene. At one point a woman screams, ”It’s illegal to record.”  Several seconds later the recording stops. Under Texas law, individuals are allowed to videotape others without their permission in public spaces with the exception of dressing rooms and bathrooms, but only if it’s not for sexual purposes.   Hernandez’s wife, Maria Toral, and her daughter were inside the restaurant when the incident began and rushed outside, yelling at the Thompsons to release Hernandez. ”The little daughter was screaming, ’Quit hitting my daddy,’” their attorney, Randall Kallinen, said. Courtney claims Thompson was acting in  . ”My client was trying to subdue him,” Courtney said. ”That’s all he was doing.”  When Hernandez stopped resisting, the Thompsons ”noticed that he was not breathing,” a statement from the Harris County Sheriff’s Office said. Before he was taken to the hospital, the statement says, Chauna Thompson performed CPR on Hernandez. The autopsy report said Hernandez’s death was a homicide and that he died from anoxic encephalopathy caused by strangulation by chest compression, reported CNN affiliate KPRC. ’We are not done’ For Hernandez’s aunt, Wendy Maldonado, the indictment is just a first step toward justice, she said. ”We are not asking for the death penalty for the Thompson family. We are only asking for life in prison,” Maldonado told reporters. Family and friends will be holding a wake Friday to honor Hernandez. He will be buried Saturday after a mass and graveside service, according to a Houston area funeral home. Randall Kallinen, an attorney for the Hernandez family, told a crowd of supporters Thursday night they need to remain vigilant. ”We are not done, though, because no one has been convicted of anything,” he said. Kallinen told CNN affiliate KTRK that the family was pleased with the district attorney’s office, which he praised as swift and thorough. ’It does raise questions for us’ The case has sparked outrage and allegations that Thompson received preferential treatment from his wife’s law enforcement colleagues. Kallinen said Hernandez’s wife was put in a police squad car for nearly four hours and had her cell phone taken away by deputies at the scene. The night of the altercation, deputies considered filing assault charges against Hernandez because the case had been reported as an assault, not a homicide, said Tom Berg, first assistant district attorney for Harris County. Officers at the scene did not tell prosecutors Hernandez was unconscious and being rushed to a hospital for treatment, according to the district attorney’s office.  Prosecutors say homicide investigators were not called to the scene because Hernandez didn’t die of his injuries until several days later. The prosecutor said homicide investigators are better trained to question witnesses and collect evidence from crime scenes.  ”It does raise questions for us,” Berg said. ”We are concerned that things happened later than they should have, but we have a complete picture now.” ”We will show no favoritism. We will let the chips fall as they may with the grand jury,” Berg added. On Wednesday, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said the agency has asked the Department of Justice and Texas Rangers to review the investigation.  ”From the beginning we have promised a fair, thorough and transparent investigation,” Gonzalez told reporters.   He said Chauna Thompson has been removed from her patrol duties and moved to an administrative job within the department until the investigation concludes. Hernandez’s family and friends gathered Wednesday in a march and rally to demand justice and urge the arrests of the Thompsons. ”This should not have happened, and the fact that it did happen shows that there are things that need to be fixed within the sheriff’s department,” Oscar Hernandez told CNN affiliate KTRK. Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled the first name of Harris County Sheriff’s Deputy Chauna Thompson."

US at crossroads on drone ops," (CNN) While much of the debate over America’s security policy during this presidential campaign has centered on the response to specific attacks    Brussels, Orlando, Nice    a remarkable thing happened earlier this month. Quietly, without much attention, the Obama administration released an important policy document into the public domain, one that has previously been classified at the highest levels, but which was released with surprisingly few redactions. It’s probably not surprising that the document didn’t generate many headlines. Released under pressure from litigation, the Presidential Policy Guidance ”Procedures for Approving Direct Action Outside the United States and Areas of Active Hostilities” is a bureaucratic sounding paper.  But the content of the document    otherwise known as the PPG, provides the first comprehensive articulation of one of the United States’ most controversial policies: the use of drones. The PPG has been driving US policy since 2013. In May of that year, President Barack Obama gave an ambitious speech in which he used the PPG to help make the case for an effective, just and legitimate framework for conducting drone strikes and capture operations against terrorist threats. The PPG lays out Obama’s rigorous standards regarding the prevention of civilian casualties and only striking those who pose an imminent threat to Americans. It also offers pages of meticulously detailed prescriptions for the bureaucratic, legal and operational process for the use of force    including which specific senior officials from across the government review proposals to capture or kill terrorists and what factors they are to consider.   It is difficult to overstate the importance of the PPG, both for its high standards and its rigorous approach to reviewing operations. I joined the White House’s National Security Council staff two weeks before President Obama approved the PPG, and I coordinated implementation of the policy in Yemen and then globally during my three years at the White House.  The President had aggressively targeted al Qaeda, and the United States was increasing the number of drone strikes. But Obama brings a strong sense of morality and interest in the long game in foreign policy, and so was perhaps the ideal president to lead the administration’s effort to set a governing framework for operations outside traditional war zones. But three years on, we are at a natural crossroads. It is therefore time for the President to think about how we want to wage drone operations going forward.   For a start, this should entail an immediate review of the PPG with the goal of streamlining and shortening the approval process for lethal action. This is necessary because the threat from extremists is perhaps worse today than when this document was drawn up. When the PPG was written, ISIS didn’t exist in its current form. Now the group has established eight branches. And despite suffering leadership losses, al Qaeda remains a potent threat as well. Meanwhile, the Edward Snowden disclosures (made shortly after the release of the PPG) and encrypted communications technologies have complicated US government efforts to detect and disrupt attacks before they take place.   We know from 15 years of targeting terrorists that success depends on aggressive   approaches that rapidly remove leaders and their successors. This, in turn, calls for even more expeditious approval of targeting proposals. The next President should therefore delegate full authority to his or her secretary of defense to approve drone strikes against terrorists, rather than subjecting such proposals to review by senior officials across the government. Our counterterrorism professionals have deeply ingrained the PPG’s high standards into their practices and culture such that we can streamline the approval process without compromising standards.     Second, the next President should double down on transparency, both in discussing the results of operations and the legal and policy framework. The recent move to acknowledge specific strikes in Yemen, along with Libya and Somalia, and to release aggregate statistics on US strikes since 2009 are steps in the right direction. But much more needs to be done to allow for greater dialogue on specific strikes and to further the legitimacy of these operations.  And this can only occur if the next President commits to working through the legal and policy complexities that make additional transparency so difficult. Finally, the next President should commit to robust, formal dialogue with outside critics.  The US government’s relationship with the media and human rights groups on drone strikes is fraught, with critics lambasting the continued lack of transparency and questioning the underlying legal framework. Many counterterrorism professionals, for their part, are wary of scrutiny from outside critics, most of whom have no experience with the program and are perceived as quick to cite shortcomings but rarely laud success.  One way to begin bridging this gap would be to implement the recommendation from a 2014 bipartisan drone task force to establish an independent commission to oversee drone policy. Such a committee    properly staffed with experts from the human rights, military, intelligence, and legal and policy communities    could increase the diversity of views provided to the President and just as importantly, create a mechanism for greater mutual understanding among the various communities involved in US drone policy.  As the recent attacks have shown, we’re a long way away from defeating ISIS and al Qaeda, and the next President will need to consider a full range of options for addressing terrorist threats.  Taking clear steps to improve the effectiveness, transparency and legitimacy of our drone operations ought to be at the top of that list."
Oklahoma high school football team wins game with one of the wackiest plays you’ll ever see,"’  ’ ’   On Thursday night, an Oklahoma high school team won a game with a     conversion in the final seconds that included the   quarterback completing a pass to himself, a lateral, and a   defender helping a runner juke five other defenders. ’ ’   The wackiness started when Sand Springs, in the white jerseys,   scored a touchdown with six seconds to play, . That made the score   (ignore the score on   the screen below, it had not been updated.) Rather than go for an   extra point and force overtime, the team elected to go for two   and the win. ’ ’   Sand Springs quarterback Hunter Greathouse took the snap and   tried to throw to a wide receiver on a quick slant.

Obama administration announces new fair housing rules," (CNN) The Obama administration announced Wednesday a new rule aimed at promoting fair housing, nearly 50 years after the Fair Housing Act of 1968 was passed to combat segregation and   discrimination in neighborhoods across the country. Despite the decades old law requiring communities that receive federal funds to increase access to quality, affordable housing, many communities in the U. S.    in cities like Chicago and Baltimore    remain segregated by race and income. Often these   communities lack access to good schools, grocery stores and to the kinds of opportunities necessary to help residents rise out of poverty.  The Department of Housing and Urban Development said the regulations will provide communities that receive HUD funding with data and tools that will help them meet fair housing obligations and goals for affordable housing and community development. ”As a former mayor, I know firsthand that strong communities are vital to the   and prosperity of families,” HUD Secretary Julián Castro said in a statement. ”Unfortunately, too many Americans find their dreams limited by where they come from, and a ZIP code should never determine a child’s future.” RELATED: Obama, living   pay tribute to 150 years of Secret Service, Castro later Wednesday morning tweeted ”Ensuring that American families can live where they choose isn’t a Republican or Democratic issue  —   it’s an American issue” with the hashtag ”#Fairhousing” at the end.  The Fair Housing Act requires HUD and its program recipients to promote fair housing and equal opportunity to ensure that all people have the right to fair housing regardless of their race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability or familial status. The new rule aims to provide program participants with clear guidelines and data    including searchable   maps that incorporate data sets about income, race, disability status and other measures    they can use to reach those goals. The rule clarifies and simplifies existing fair housing obligations and creates a streamlined process for evaluating fair housing, the HUD statement said.  ”HUD will provide open data to grantees and the public on patterns of integration and segregation, racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty, disproportionate housing needs, and disparities in access to opportunity,” the agency said.  The new rule has been in the works since July 2013. RELATED: Immigration: The debate Republicans don’t want, Affected HUD programs include the Community Development Block Grant program    a popular, flexible federal funding stream for communities    and the HOME Investment Partnership program, which provides grants to states and communities use to fund building, buying, and rehabilitating affordable housing for rent or sale and providing rental assistance to   people among other activities. HUD’s announcement was not welcomed by everyone. Conservative critics like Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government, argue communities know what is best for their them and local leaders are held accountable by voters for the decisions they make. He said the federal government’s   approach tends to try to shove all communities into a     model that may not work for them. ”Local government is designed so people can have an input on those things that matter most to them,” Manning told CNN. ”The federal government is   to superimpose their vision of what local communities should look like, because they don’t have their fingers on the pulse of those communities.” The new HUD rule follows a Supreme Court decision last month, hailed by civil rights advocates, that   that the Fair House Act allows not only claims for intentional discrimination but also claims that cover practices that have a discriminatory effect, even if they were not motivated by an intent to discriminate.  Advocates say these ”disparate impact” claims are key to fighting subtle instances of discrimination. Some companies, developers and housing authorities had argued that disparate impact claimsforce states or private entities to engage in     to avoid legal liability and that they cost them time and money to investigate actions made with good intentions.

Obama says Trump ’unfit’ for presidency,"Washington (CNN) President Barack Obama offered one of his sharpest denunciations of Donald Trump to date Tuesday, declaring the Republican nominee entirely unfit to serve as president and lambasting Republicans for sticking by their nominee. The strong rebuke in the White House East Room came after Trump’s criticism of the family of a slain Muslim US soldier, along with comments that displayed apparent confusion related to the Russian incursion into Ukraine. ”The Republican nominee is unfit to serve as president,” Obama said at a White House news conference with the Prime Minister of Singapore. ”He keeps on proving it.” The Trump campaign responded by going after the Democratic nominee as well as the President. ”Hillary Clinton has proven herself unfit to serve in any government office,” a Trump statement said, listing a number of policy concerns. ”  have   destabilized the Middle East, handed Iraq, Libya and Syria to ISIS, and allowed our personnel to be slaughtered at Benghazi.” Later Trump in an interview with WJLA said of Obama: ”He’s a terrible president. He’ll probably go down as the worst president in the history of our country. He’s been a total disaster.” Obama on Tuesday described his feelings about Trump as unprecedented, recalling disagreements with previous GOP presidential nominees Sen. John McCain and Mitt Romney    but never an outright sense they were unfit to serve. ”The notion that he would attack a Gold Star family that made such extraordinary sacrifices on behalf of our country, the fact that he doesn’t appear to have basic knowledge of critical issues in Europe, the Middle East, in Asia, means that he’s woefully unprepared to do this job,” Obama said. RELATED: Donald Trump’s bad 72 hours, Speaking alongside Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in the White House East Room, Obama said there are now weekly episodes in which even Republican party leaders distance themselves from Trump. ”There has to be a point at which you say, ’Enough,’ ” Obama said. Obama goes after Trump’s party, Obama placed responsibility for Trump’s statements squarely on his fellow Republicans, many of whom denounced his statements on the slain soldier’s family but didn’t withdraw their support. ”What does this say about your party that this is your  ?” Obama asked of GOP leaders. ”This isn’t a situation where you have an episodic gaffe. This is daily and weekly where they are distancing themselves from statements he’s making. There has to be a point at which you say, ’This is not somebody I can support for president of the United States, even if he purports to be a member of my party.’ ” Obama said that denunciations from Republicans of Trump’s remarks ”ring hollow” without an accompanying withdrawal of support. READ MORE: Russia continues to shadow Trump, ”I don’t doubt their sincerity. I don’t doubt they were outraged by some of the statements that Mr. Trump and his supporters made about the Khan family,” Obama said. ”But there has to come a point in which you say, ’Somebody who makes those kinds of statements doesn’t have the judgment, the temperament, the understanding to occupy the most powerful position in the world.’ ” Trump and the family of the slain soldier have been locked in an increasingly bitter dispute over Muslims in America and the nature of patriotic sacrifice. After Khizir Khan, who lost his son in a suicide bombing in Iraq, declared at last week’s Democratic National Convention that Trump had ”sacrificed nothing,” the Republican nominee claimed he’d been ”viciously attacked” and questioned why Khan’s wife, Ghazala, didn’t make her own remarks. Criticism from Trump’s own party came swiftly, including in a lengthy statement from McCain, whom Trump previously derided for having been taken captive in the Vietnam War. But he and other top GOP leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, made little indication they would withdraw support for the Republican candidate. Trump has also taken flak for appearing unaware that Russian forces had annexed Crimea in early 2014, saying on ABC’s ”This Week” Sunday that President Vladimir Putin is ”not going into Ukraine.” Later, he argued that the people of Crimea ”would rather be with Russia than where they were”    an argument that Putin himself has made in justifying his annexation of the disputed Ukrainian territory. Trump looks for better Russia ties, And he’s maintained his view that fostering better ties to Putin would benefit areas of American foreign policy, including in the fight against ISIS. ”If we could get along with Russia, wouldn’t that be a good thing, instead of a bad thing?” Trump asked Monday during a campaign appearance in Pennsylvania. Trump also took heat for calling on Russia last week to release deleted emails from Clinton if they had obtained them in a hack of the Democratic National Committee, which US officials have fingered Moscow for.  At the news conference, Obama said the alleged Russian hacking wouldn’t necessarily prompt a complete freeze in relations between the the country and the United States. Noting that the FBI was still investigating the hack, Obama said cybersecurity was just another dispute of many between Putin and himself. ”If in fact Russia engaged in this activity, it’s just one on a long list of issues that me and Mr. Putin talk about,” Obama said. ”I don’t think that it wildly swings what is a tough, difficult relationship that we have with Russia right now.” RELATED: Russia continues to shadow Trump, Obama’s administration, through the Justice Department’s national security division, continues to investigate the hack. Neither the White House nor the FBI have publicly blamed Russia for the intrusion. But federal officials said there is strong evidence indicating the breach was perpetrated by hackers working on behalf of Russia intelligence. Trump has brushed off Democratic charges that Putin could be behind the hack in order to tip the US election in his favor, claiming he’s never met the Russian leader and doesn’t maintain a relationship with him. In statements from only a few years ago, however, Trump said he enjoyed warm ties with Putin. Obama’s remarks Tuesday intensify his patten of inserting himself into the rancorous presidential race. While the President has freely criticized Trump in the year since the businessman entered the race, his denunciations have come faster and harsher in the last several weeks. At last week’s convention, Obama named Trump repeatedly, arguing the candidate was ignorant of facts and intent on dividing the nation. And in June, Obama lit into Trump’s response to the mass shooting in Orlando, saying he was peddling a dangerous vision. The President is expected to play an outsized role on the campaign trail in the coming months as Clinton works to motivate the supporters who helped elect Obama to office twice. "
"Report Shows Vast Reach of Russian Doping: 1,000 Athletes, 30 Sports - The New York Times","LONDON  —   International sports’ antidoping watchdog on Friday laid out mountainous evidence that for years Russian officials orchestrated a doping program at the Olympics and other competitions that involved or benefited 1, 000 athletes in 30 sports. The findings intensified pressure on the International Olympic Committee to reassess Russia’s medals from the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and penalize the nation ahead of the 2018 Winter Games. The evidence, published by the World   Agency, was the coda to a set of investigations led by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, who issued a damning report in July that prompted more than 100 Russian athletes to be barred from the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The   report outlined competitions that had been tainted by years of extraordinary preparations, ensuring Russia’s dominance at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the 2013 track and field world championships in Moscow and the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi  —   the “apex” of Russia’s cheating, the report said, because as the host of the event it controlled drug testing. The subterfuge included using table salt and Nescafé   granules to help conceal tainted urine and bypass controls, according to the inquiry. Some samples were clearly fraudulent: Urine provided by two female hockey players at the Sochi Games contained male DNA. Yet Mr. McLaren suggested that the full extent of the cheating might never be known. “It is impossible to know just how deep and how far back this conspiracy goes,” he said on Friday, calling the “immutable facts” of his report clear but far from comprehensive. “For years, international sports competitions have unknowingly been hijacked by the Russians. ” Mr. McLaren concluded last summer that Russia had orchestrated rampant doping dating back years that culminated in an elaborate   operation at the 2014 Sochi Games, confirming what The New York Times reported in May. But in the face of staunch denials from Russian officials and skepticism from sports authorities reluctant to punish the nation on his word, he and a team have continued their work these last five months. Asked for their evidence, they zeroed in on the individuals who had enabled the cheating as well as those who had benefited from it, publishing on Friday 1, 166 pieces of proof, including emails, documents and scientific and forensic analysis of doping samples. As part of the inquiry, the team examined some 120 urine samples of Russian athletes from Sochi out of at least 250 that have been preserved since 2014. All the samples Mr. McLaren examined had been tampered with, he said, including those of 15 medalists  —   including winners of gold. From the 2012 London Games, Mr. McLaren identified 15 medalists whose doping violations had been concealed. Ten of them have been stripped of their medals, the report said, after widespread retesting this year. The names of most of the implicated athletes were redacted  —   they were referred to by unique sets of numbers  —   but their identities had been privately shared with relevant officials for each sport’s global governing body, Mr. McLaren said, emphasizing that it was not his job to issue penalties. Outside of the Olympics, sports governing bodies have autonomy over disciplining athletes for violations like doping or manipulating samples. Thomas Bach, the president of the I. O. C. said in a statement on Friday that the report’s findings demonstrated “a fundamental attack on the integrity of sport. ” On Thursday, he had said that “any athlete who took part in such a sophisticated manipulation system” should be excluded from attending future Olympics in any capacity. Mr. Bach said all urine samples retained from Russian athletes who competed in the 2014 Sochi Games would be   along with those from the 2012 London Games that have not yet been retested. The I. O. C. has appointed two commissions in response to Mr. McLaren’s report. A team is expected to examine the Sochi doping samples for evidence of banned substances  —   though unlikely to find any if tainted urine was substituted  —   as well as other signs of tampering. On Friday, Mr. Bach called Mr. McLaren to thank him for his work, which he previously had greeted with skepticism. “It was a big change from the reaction in July,” Mr. McLaren said. The Russian sports ministry said in a statement that it was studying the report “to formulate a constructive position,” denying the existence of any   doping programs in sports and promising to “continue the fight against doping from the positions of ‘zero tolerance. ’” The ministry pledged its cooperation with global sports and antidoping authorities to improve Russia’s antidoping operations. Mr. McLaren’s report described the lengths to which various branches of the Russian government went to shield the nation’s antidoping lab from scrutiny. In 2014, when World   Agency inspectors were due to make a surprise visit to the Moscow lab, personnel at the Ministry of Sport tipped the lab off to their trip after learning they had applied for visas. The evidence also included crucial communications between Russia’s former deputy sports minister Yuri Nagornykh  —   who was dismissed amid scandal last summer  —   and Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the nation’s former antidoping lab director, who told The Times last spring exactly how he had helped top Russian athletes dope on state orders. He described an operation out of a spy thriller in which he, with the guidance of sports officials and the help of members of the country’s intelligence service, broke into supposedly   bottles every night to replace urine tainted by   drugs with clean urine collected months earlier. Mr. Nagornykh and the sports ministry gave Dr. Rodchenkov explicit direction to cover up top athletes’ use of   steroids, according to emails and spreadsheets. Mr. McLaren’s report and an accompanying searchable website of evidence leave little doubt that Russia’s doping program was among the most sophisticated in sports history, perhaps ranking only behind that of the East German regime. Some felt it was worse after reading the details. “Even in the darkest days of   doping in the former East Bloc in the 1970s and 1980s, the organized drugging of athletes was not also propped up by the deliberate corruption of antidoping measures on such a shocking scale,” said Joseph de Pencier, chief executive of the Institute of National   Organisations, based in Germany. He called for the I. O. C. to exclude Russia from the Olympics until it was “demonstrably free of the will to subvert the fundamental values and spirit of sport. ” The I. O. C. commissions’ work is expected to lay the foundation for disciplinary action against even more Russian Olympians, after a year in which dozens have been penalized and more than 100 barred from global competition. Leading up to the report’s release on Friday, sports officials had braced themselves for the final set of facts with which the disciplinary authorities would be expected to work. “I hope it’s all for nothing,”   Kasper, an I. O. C. executive and president of skiing’s global governing body, said during a smoke break in Switzerland this week in the middle of a full day of   meetings with sports officials who were anticipating the McLaren report. “For the winter sports federations, we’re in the middle of the season,” Mr. Kasper said. “We’re going to have to react immediately. In the middle of the competition, it’s not easy. ” Winter sports officials could encounter acute pressure similar to that faced by summer sports officials this year when they had about two weeks to rule on which Russian athletes could compete in Rio after Mr. McLaren’s report. Russia is set to hold the world championships in bobsled and skeleton in Sochi in two months. American athletes have talked about boycotting that event as a show of dissatisfaction with sports officials’ handling of the Russian doping scandal. The governing body for those sports said on Friday that it would give “highest priority and urgency” to reacting to the new details. On Thursday, less than 24 hours before the report’s publication, Mr. Bach repeated the Olympic committee’s guidance that sports federations freeze or terminate their preparations for hosting events in Russia. But ahead of Friday, Mr. Bach had little idea what to expect. Mr. McLaren had closely guarded his findings, declining to share them earlier with Olympic officials as they requested he instead waited to make the package public on Friday. He will be cooperating with the I. O. C. commissions going forward, he said. One of the chief criticisms Russian officials and some global sports authorities made of Mr. McLaren’s initial work was that he had not heard Russia’s side of the story. In Friday’s report, he addressed that possible vulnerability, invoking his communications with Vitaly Smirnov, a former longtime Olympic official from Russia whom President Vladimir V. Putin appointed last summer to lead antidoping reform. Vitaly Mutko, Russia’s former minister of sport, whom Mr. Putin recently elevated to deputy prime minister, did not accept Mr. McLaren’s request for a meeting, the report said. Mr. Smirnov’s statements about reforming Russia, Mr. McLaren suggested on Friday, may be the most direct sort of admission he expects to receive that the “institutional conspiracy” he detailed took place. In setting his findings out, Mr. McLaren called for an end to infighting in global sports and unity in fighting cheating. “Russia needs to get its act together to change the culture,” Olivier Niggli, director general of the World   Agency, said, echoing something Mr. Mutko himself acknowledged to The Times in July. “Hopefully this will help the Russians themselves to accept the facts and take a positive attitude toward changing things rather than saying this is a plot from the West with no evidence,” Mr. Niggli said. “It’s in the public domain, and everybody can look at it. ”"
FS1’s Whitlock: ESPN Has Gone Political to Try to ’Perfect’ the World - Breitbart,"During the Wednesday “Outkick the Coverage” broadcast on Fox Sports Radio, FS1 personality Jason Whitlock weighed in on his former employer ESPN’s increase in political coverage, saying the company has gone political in attempt to turn the world into more of a controlled safe space where everybody gets along.  Partial transcript as follows, starting at the 18:16 mark: They believe in the experiment. If you really understand the far left, the Marxists, it’s like they want to take the jungle and turn it into a zoo. The world is a jungle. They want to turn it into a zoo. In a zoo, everybody gets along, everybody stays in their little safe spaces, cages, no one gets killed, there is no real competition, everybody gets fed the same stuff, and so, I think the people at ESPN think, “We can perfect this jungle if we just make it a zoo. No one will get killed. The lions and the giraffes, they’ll look at each other from across their cages and they’ll get along  …    ” But at the end of the day, I think there are people that rightfully believe, “God created a jungle and we can be nice and play along, but there is going to be some competition here. And if you’re weak, you’re going to get left behind. And if you’re not careful, a lion’s going to come over here and ravage you. That is what the world is. ” Again, do we need some parameters within the jungle to make things fair? Absolutely, but turn it into a zoo? No dice. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent"
Federal Court Rules Texas’ ID Law Violates Voting Rights Act - The New York Times,"HOUSTON  —   A federal appeals court on Wednesday ruled that Texas’ voter identification law, one of the strictest in the country, violated the Voting Rights Act and that the state must find ways to accommodate voters who face hardships in obtaining the necessary documents. Democrats and voting rights advocates hailed the ruling as a significant victory in one of the nation’s most closely watched voting rights cases. It was the fourth time in nearly four years that a federal court found that the Texas law discriminated against or disproportionately affected black and Hispanic voters. “The court got it right, recognizing the stink of discrimination,” said Trey Martinez Fischer, a state representative who is the chairman of the   Legislative Caucus, one of several minority groups, voters and Democratic lawmakers who sued Texas over the law. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, found that the law had a discriminatory effect on blacks and Latinos, who often lack the forms of identification required under the Texas law. But the ruling did not strike down the law entirely, ruling instead that new procedures must be found to assist potential voters lacking the required identification. The ruling also sent back for reconsideration the question of whether Texas legislators had acted with a discriminatory purpose in passing the law in 2011, a finding that would have forced new judicial oversight of any changes in Texas election rules. Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican who defended the voter ID law against legal challenges when he was the state’s attorney general, said the court had come to the wrong conclusion. Republican lawmakers have long defended the law, saying it is needed to prevent voter fraud. “Voter fraud is real, and it undermines the integrity of the election process,” Mr. Abbott said in a statement. “Texas will continue to make sure there is no illegal voting at the ballot box. ” Passed by the   Legislature and signed by Gov. Rick Perry in 2011, the law took effect in 2013. It requires voters to present one of several forms of   identification, including a driver’s license, passport, military ID card or   license. A lower court judge found that about 608, 000 registered voters in Texas lacked the types of identification required by the law, and that a disproportionate number were black or Hispanic. The judge based that finding on testimony and data presented by experts during a 2014 trial in Corpus Christi. Texas’ lawyers disputed that figure. In its ruling, the Fifth Circuit asked a lower court judge to come up with a remedy that “disrupts voter identification rules for the 2016 election season as little as possible, yet eliminates” the law’s discriminatory effect on minority voters. One possible solution, the court noted, would be to allow   cards to be used as identification. The court also instructed the judge to   the evidence about whether the Texas Legislature intentionally discriminated against blacks and Hispanics, but encouraged the judge to wait until after the November election. The Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, said in a statement that the state had a duty to safeguard elections. “Preventing voter fraud is essential to accurately reflecting the will of Texas voters during elections, and it is unfortunate that this   law, providing protections against fraud, was not upheld in its entirety,” Mr. Paxton said. Asked if the state would appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, a spokeswoman for Mr. Paxton, Kayleigh Lovvorn, replied, “We are evaluating all of our options right now. ” Richard L. Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, called the decision on Wednesday “huge in a symbolic way” for voting rights across the country. Since the Supreme Court weakened the federal Voting Rights Act in 2013, he noted, several states have been “ratcheting up” their voter ID requirements. What the Fifth Circuit  —   known as perhaps the country’s most conservative appeals court  —   has ruled is that “you can go too far with a voter ID law,” he said. “If Texas had been allowed to do what it’s been trying to do, that would be a green light for other states to try something similar,” Professor Hasen said. But he added that the plaintiffs’ victory was not as great as it would have been if the court had struck down the law. Myrna Pérez, the deputy director of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, which helped argue the plaintiffs’ case, called the ruling a “big victory. ” “The court said the law is discriminatory and needs to be fixed,’’ she said."
Caddell: Political Elites Will Tell Us Terrorism Is ‘New Normal’,"  Democrat pollster Pat Caddell spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow Monday about the weekend’s terrorist attacks in New York, New Jersey, and Minnesota, and questioned if they should be considered “the new normal. ”[Caddell stated, “I don’t think that this was the end of it. We may, sadly, see more. But the question here is, are we to accept this as the new normal?” He added, “Or are we going to take the approach, ‘Not in our house’ and really get tough on this stuff?”  Added Caddell, “I suspect this will now have a huge impact on the race. The media was all over Trump on Saturday for saying the obvious, that it was a bomb. ” “I think what we’re going to find in this country is, finally, it’s enough,” he went on. “It’s a very simple matter. Are you willing to take this as the new normal and just adjust to it   …      or are you going to get serious about this stuff, including taking in all the new refugees?” “I think the political elite,” said Caddell, “and the globalists in this country   …     will say, ‘Well, just get used to it it’s the new normal.’ I don’t think mainstream America is  going to be there. That’s not an American attitude. ” “To that extent, I think if Trump is on that message, it’ll work,” he concluded.

"Illegal Aliens Rally for Sanctuary for Aliens, Muslims, LGBTs","Illegal aliens and supporters for a sanctuary city stood out in the rain in front of the city’s administration building on Thursday chanting, “Not on our watch,” and “One city, one fight. ” They want protection for illegal aliens, Muslims, and the LGBT community. [The Merced Sun Star reported about the gathering and press conference in Merced, California, a city located in Merced County in the Central Valley of Northern California. The population of the city is just a little over 80, 000 people.  A group called the Merced Organizing Project were reported to be thinking about asking city and county officials for solutions in becoming a “regional sanctuary” for illegal aliens. The report said supporters of the idea began talking about the idea after the election of Donald Trump. Members of the group, and another group called Faith in the Valley PICO partners, were said to be urging President Barack Obama to protect illegal aliens, and to give clemency for nonviolent drug offenders who are in jail. The PICO group are from five counties in California  —   Fresno, Kern, Merced, San Joaquin and Stanislaus. The call for a sanctuary city for illegal aliens in California is just the latest in the move by open border activists and Democrats to dig their heels in for sanctuary city protection. As reported by Breitbart Texas in   after the presidential election, the mayors of New York City, Seattle, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Providence showed great defiance at any suggestion of an   city law that would apply nationwide. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said after the November 8th election, “Chicago always will be a sanctuary city,” NPR reported.  “To all those who are, after Tuesday’s election, very nervous and filled with anxiety   …     you are safe in Chicago, you are secure in Chicago and you are supported in Chicago. ” Chicago has some of the highest crime and murder rates of any city in the nation. This year, as Breitbart News reported in October, homicides had reached almost 600 in the   city. Breitbart Texas reported on Wednesday that there are forty sanctuary cities that are   on their commitment to open border,   sanctuary city immigration policies. Austin in Texas, and Berkeley, Los Angeles, Oakland, Richmond, and San Francisco in California are among the cities. New York, New York, Boston, Denver, Detroit, Jersey City, New Haven, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Portland, Syracuse, St. Paul and Tuscon are some of the cities among those listed. Texas is moving forward with legislation to block sanctuary city policies in the Lone Star State. State Senator Charles Perry ( ) introduced legislation in   to ban sanctuary cities in Texas, Breitbart Texas reported. The murderer of Kathryn Steinle, as reported by Breitbart California, said during an interview that he came to San Francisco because he knew he would not be deported. Juan Francisco   had been deported five times and was a   convicted felon. Mary Ann Mendoza, the mother of a police officer who was killed by a drunk illegal alien told Breitbart Texas: “When elected officials start taking actions to protect illegal criminals and as some have stated, using taxpayer money to offer legal assistance, you have to wonder what place Americans who have been affected by illegal crime have in this big picture. We are now becoming the group in the shadows, ignored by local politicians, shunned by mainstream media and standing on the sidelines watching illegal criminals getting more benefits and protection then our loved ones ever got. This insanity and the power hungry politicians using these issues for votes (from illegal aliens) to stay in office sickens me. Americans matter, Americans need protection and Americans should come first, after all, we do live in America, right?” Ms. Mendoza lost her son, Mesa Police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, to an intoxicated criminal illegal alien. The    police officer from Mesa, Arizona, was killed when the drunk illegal alien drove down the wrong way on a highway. Mendoza said her son’s killer had previously been charged with burglary, assault of a peace officer, and fraud. He never appeared in court and was on the run for 12 years. He was caught at the border and they took him to Colorado where he was shown leniency and released. Ms. Mendoza said that “Donald Trump is the change this country needs,” Breitbart Texas reported in June. Breitbart News reported in late May that Sabine Durden, whose    son Dominic was murdered by an illegal alien, said she “lost it” when Donald Trump kissed her son’s poster. A video in the article captured Trump’s interaction with mothers who had lost their children to violence by criminal illegal aliens. Durden said that Dominic’s killer had committed two felonies but pleaded them down to one. He was deported and illegally returned and committed two DUI offenses for which he received probation. During the first DUI probation she said, he was caught again, and received probation. Three weeks later the criminal illegal alien killed her son by running into Dominic on his motorcycle with his truck. He was just under the legal limit for DUI. She said that despite what he had done, the criminal illegal alien only received a misdemeanor without gross negligence and a nine   years probation sentence. He only served 35 days. Durden told Breitbart Texas: “As a legal immigrant and now citizen, I take great offense to their action. It’s a slap in the face of every citizen, immigrant, and those going through the legal process of becoming citizens. We are a country of laws and those officials who think they are above the law need to be removed from office and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. The money and time spent on people that are here illegally comes out of the pocket of taxpayers and needs to be used on citizens and their needs. I can’t just walk into the mayor’s home with my family and demand he now has to take care of me because I don’t like where I live. ” The grieving mother asked, “Where is a sanctuary place for us victims to get away from the pain and grief caused by an illegal alien?” Lana Shadwick is a writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

Official: Russia Knew Syrian Chemical Attack Was Coming,"(AP) WASHINGTON  —   The United States has concluded Russia knew in advance of Syria’s chemical weapons attack last week, a senior U. S. official said Monday. [The official said a drone operated by Russians was flying over a hospital as victims of the attack were rushing to get treatment. Hours after the drone left, a   fighter jet bombed the hospital in what American officials believe was an attempt to cover up the usage of chemical weapons.  The senior official said the U. S. has no proof of Russian involvement in the actual chemical attack in northern Syria. But the official said the presence of the surveillance drone over the hospital couldn’t have been a coincidence, and that Russia must have known the chemical weapons attack was coming and that victims were seeking treatment. The official, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on intelligence matters and demanded anonymity, didn’t give precise timing for when the drone was in the area, where more than 80 people were killed. The official also didn’t provide details for the military and intelligence information that form the basis of what the Pentagon now believes. Another U. S. official cautioned that no final American determination has been made that Russia knew ahead of time that chemical weapons would be used. That official wasn’t authorized to speak about internal administration deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity. The allegation of Russian foreknowledge is grave, even by the standards of the currently dismal U. S.  relations. Although Russia has steadfastly supported Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government, and they’ve coordinated military attacks together, Washington has never previously accused Moscow of complicity in any attack that involved the gassing of innocent civilians, including children. The former Cold War foes even worked together in 2013 to remove and destroy more than 1, 300 tons of Syrian chemical weapons and agents. Until Monday, U. S. officials had said they weren’t sure whether Russia or Syria operated the drone. The official said the U. S. is now convinced Russia controlled the drone. The official said it still isn’t clear who was flying the jet that bombed the hospital, because the Syrians also fly   aircraft. U. S. officials previously have said Russians routinely work with Syrians at the Shayrat air base where the attack is supposed to have originated. U. S. officials say the chemical weapons were stored there and that those elements add to the conclusion that Russia was complicit in the attack. Last Thursday 59 Tomahawk missiles were fired on the   base in the United States’ first direct military action against Assad’s forces. The U. S. has been focusing its military action in Syria on defeating the Islamic State group. On Monday, Col. John J. Thomas, a U. S. military spokesman, said the U. S. has taken extra defensive precautions in Syria in case of possible retaliation against American forces for the cruise missile attack. Thomas told reporters at the Pentagon that the increased emphasis on defensive measures to protect U. S. troops on the ground in Syria led to a slight and temporary decline in offensive U. S. airstrikes against IS in Syria. There has been no Syrian retaliation so far for the cruise missile attack, which destroyed or rendered inoperable more than 20 Syria air force planes, he said. Thomas said the U. S. intends to return to full offensive air operations against IS as soon as possible."
"EXCLUSIVE - Farage Tells Breitbart: ‘Obama Visit Caused “Brexit Bounce”, Swayed Vote In Favour Of Leave’","UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader Nigel Farage told Breitbart that the visit by President Obama, where he threatened to send Britain to the “back of the queue” if the public voted to leave the European Union (EU) backfired and caused a “Brexit Bounce” swaying Britons to vote for Brexit. [Comparing the outcome to the American Independence Day, Mr. Farage said:  “You [Americans] have your Independence Day where in July you celebrate being your own country, governing yourself, having your own courts, controlling your own borders and that’s what happened to us yesterday. “We have broken away from a political union where our power was being overruled, our courts were being overruled,  and we had a complete open border for anybody from southern and eastern Europe, so this is a major historic step. ” On the EU   he said: “We’ve not just changed British history. I’m sure that the EU project itself will now come tumbling down.  I would like to think and hope that right across the globe what we’ve done is to prove that people power can beat the establishment. “The European Union project has failed.  It is dying before your very eyes.  It is unwanted, it is unloved, and people across the country are saying what UKIP has been saying for years: ‘We want our country back, we want our democracy back, we want the closest possible relationship with our neighbours. We’re happy to have a NAFTA kind of agreement with free trade, but we don’t want political union’. ” Asked of any lessons drawn from his own experiences that could be applied during the American presidential elections, Mr. Farage advised: “Threatening people insults their  intelligence. “Don’t threaten people repeatedly because if you do in the end they think you’re crying wolf and they won’t believe you.  It’s Project Fear, or in the end when Obama came it was Project Threat. Citing Mr. Obama’s visit to the UK at the request of Prime Minister David Cameron: The lessons learnt from the Obama visit are fascinating.  Here is the most powerful man in the world coming from a country that we have always had huge regard for. And people in Britain listening to Obama said: ‘how dare the American president come here and tell us what to do’ and it backfired. And I think we got an Obama Brexit Bounce, because people do not want to be told how to think and how to vote."
Tea Party Founder Compares ’Stop the Steal’ to 2009 Congressional Town Halls - Breitbart,"In August of 2009, tea party activists were instructed by Tea Party Patriots, Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Works to go to Congressional Town Halls and confront Democrat Congressmen over support of ObamaCare. [Tea Party Patriots even passed out an “action memo” to be used as a guide for tea party activists attending Congressional Town Halls.  The memo instructed activists to give Congressmen “reality checks” from “We the People” at the town halls. The activists that attended the town halls were there to intimidate Congressmen into changing their position on ObamaCare. Fox News and other conservative media outlets were very supportive of this action at the town halls. In 2013, Tea Party Patriots led the way in organizing activists to attend Congressional Town Halls and “pressure” Republican Senators and Congressmen about the “Gang of Eight” Immigration Bill. The strategy was very successful in getting elected officials to change their support of the immigration bill. Roger Stone is planning a similar   event called Stop the Steal that will take place at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland to pressure delegates not to turn their back on the will of the voters. I strongly encourage Trump supporters across the nation to attend the rally and have their voices heard. I have been astonished at the hypocritical condemnation of this event by the very people that were cheering the tea party on in 2009 when we were confronting Congressional Democrats at their town halls and also, confronting Republicans at town halls to get them to change their stance on the Gang of Eight Bill in 2013. What Stone is organizing is no different than what activists did at the Congressional Town halls. The Republican establishment elitists and Ted Cruz are tone deaf to the message sent by millions of Republican Primary voters. Millions would completely walk away from the Republican Party and never look back if the nomination were denied Trump in a contested convention. It would cause massive damage to Republican candidates all the way down the ticket. The Stop the Steal event and other rallies may actually save the Republican Party from committing political suicide by pressuring delegates in a peaceful way not to turn their back on the will of voters. The Stop the Steal rally may just be preview of coming attractions if Trump is denied the nomination. From what activists are telling me, they are prepared to protest at every campaign stop of the Republican nominee during the general election campaign. As a tea party founder and   devotee of Sen. Cruz, I am extremely disappointed to discover that he has turned into the very thing he used to rail against  —   elitist establishment that think they know better than average voters. Cruz is in collusion with the Republican establishment and donor class to deprive Trump of the nomination. Sen. Cruz claims to be a Constitutional Conservative, yet he is systematically working to undermine one of the most important rights granted in the Constitution  —   the right to vote. His campaign is using the arcane Republican Party delegate selection process to “steal the vote” of the millions that have cast their votes for Donald Trump. I have witnessed this first hand in Georgia on April 16. Sen. Cruz and his campaign systematically conspired to disenfranchise the 502, 000 Georgians that cast their votes for Donald Trump on March 1. They were successful in securing 32 delegate slots out of 42 up for grabs on that day. Two of the Georgia Grassroots Coordinators for Cruz were elected as delegates pledged to Donald Trump. Another Georgia leader for Cruz that is serving as a Trump delegate, former Congressman Bob Barr, took the fifth when he was asked on MSNBC if he would support the nominee that came out of the Republican convention. It seems Sen. Cruz’s campaign mentality is that the ends justify the means, so it is ok to attempt to overturn the will of voters. I think Sen. Cruz and some of his supporters truly believe that he is a Savior to the conservative movement and that it is ok to do whatever it takes to win. It has been extremely disappointing to see this and in the future they have lost the moral authority to challenge the establishment elitists when they use the same tactics. Sen. Cruz is extremely delusional in believing that if he is successful in knocking Donald Trump out at a contested Republican Convention, Trump supporters would get behind him. I hope to be elected a Trump delegate at the Georgia GOP State Convention and I will tell you, I would never, under any circumstances, support Sen. Cruz in a contested convention. Many Trump supporters view Sen. Cruz in a very negative light. I did an informal survey of Trump supporters on social media and asked the following question, “If Trump is far ahead in the GOP delegate count, but Cruz manages to steal the nomination from him at the GOP Convention, would you vote for Cruz over Hillary in the General Election?” 574 Trump supporters responded in the following way: Yes  —   3. 42% No  —   41. 03% Undecided  —   5. 98% Hell No  —   49. 57% I fully expect Donald Trump to have the nomination sewed up by the time of the convention. If not, it will be a very interesting and pivotal time for the Republican Party. Debbie Dooley is a Tea Party Founder and  National Tea Party Leader. Twitter @crimsontider"
Berlin attack suspect Anis Amri killed in Milan shootout," (CNN) Video has emerged of Berlin Christmas market attack suspect Anis Amri pledging allegiance to ISIS. The footage appeared hours after the Tunisian man was killed in a Friday morning shootout with police in Milan, Italy.  The subject of a   manhunt since Monday’s deadly market attack, Amri was stopped in Sesto San Giovanni, a district in the northeastern part of Milan, just after 3 a. m. local time, Italian police said on Twitter. A video released on   website Amaq shows Amri pledging allegiance to the group’s leader, Abu Bakr   and vowing that ”we will slaughter” the ”crusaders who are shelling the Muslims every day.” He does not refer to Monday’s attack that left 12 dead and injured 48, and it’s not clear when or where the video was recorded.  Who was Anis Amri? The encounter that led to Amri’s death began when Italian police asked for his papers. When that happened, Amri pulled a .  gun out of his backpack and fired at them, police said.  The driver of the police car returned fire, killing the    suspect. A police officer, Cristian Morio, was shot in the encounter and is recovering in the hospital. A second officer, Luca Scata, was unharmed.   Two countries tried to deport him, Amri shouted, ”Bastard cops,” before he was killed, according to Milan police Chief Antonio De Iesu. At a press conference, Italian Interior Minister Marco Minniti said the slain man was Amri ”without any doubt.” The Tunisian had previously lived in Italy.  The officers were not searching for him but stopped Amri as part of normal patrol operations, De Iesu said. Nobody had alerted the police to Amri’s presence in the city. Amri traveled from France, report says  Italian news agency ANSA said Amri came to Milan by train from the French region of Savoy. A spokeswoman for the French   prosecutor’s office, Agnes Thibault Lecuivre, could not confirm the report, telling CNN the investigation was ongoing. Milan police said Amri arrived at the city’s central station about 1 a. m. Friday. If he did travel from France, Amri would have passed through at least two European borders after fleeing Berlin.  In response, Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s   National Front Party, criticized the European Union’s open borders policy as a ”security disaster.”   German officials are working to determine whether Amri had a network of people helping him flee to Italy, German federal prosecutor Peter Frank said. Amri was on threat list  Amri was considered to be one of the most dangerous Islamists in the country for months before Monday’s attack, according to German intelligence officials. In March, he was put on a German security services list of dangerous people, which currently includes 549 individuals, the officials said.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a press conference that government ministers will be assessing what security measures need to be adapted in the wake of this week’s attack. Merkel said she had spoken to Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi about speeding up the process of returning Tunisians living in Germany illegally.  Links to Italy, Without identification, Amri entered Italy in February 2011 and claimed to be a    minor, a spokesman for the Italian state police, Mario Viola, told CNN earlier this week.   While in Italy, he served four years in prison after being involved in an arson attack on a school, his father told Tunisian radio.  Viola said that Amri’s jail term for damaging state property, assault and arson at the Lampedusa refugee center began in late 2011. He was released in May 2015. Italian authorities ordered his deportation, but Tunisian authorities wouldn’t accept the request on the grounds of a lack of proper documentation, Viola said. At that point, Italian authorities told Amri to leave the country, and officials lost track of him. Amri was ”not suspected” of terrorism at the time and was considered a ”petty criminal,” Viola said. The Tunisian came to Italy at the same time as thousands of others amid the turmoil of the Arab Spring, he said. He left for Germany more than a year ago.  How the manhunt unfolded, Amri’s fingerprints were found in the cabin of the truck used in Monday’s attack, and German authorities are investigating whether the gun Amri used Friday was the same one in the shooting death of the truck’s Polish driver.  The slain driver may have been involved in a struggle with Amri before being shot.  German authorities initially detained a Pakistani asylum seeker in connection with the Christmas market attack, but he was later released and a search began for Amri.  European authorities offered a reward of up to 100, 000 euros (about $104, 000) for information on his whereabouts. According to German investigative files obtained by CNN, Amri had ties to an ISIS recruitment network in Germany and had previously discussed launching an attack there. Amri’s mother: ’I want the truth, Amri’s mother, Nour Elhouda Hassani, said her son called last Friday to catch up. Nothing had struck her as odd.  ”All we talked about was how are you and how is everything. I did not notice anything strange about him,” she said, speaking to CNN exclusively from her family’s home in the small Tunisian town of Oueslatia. ”When he calls me, he was playful and always laughing.  He was not an extremist, he was like all young men around here. He always went out and drank alcohol.” She demanded answers about his death.  ”I want the truth about what happened to my son,” she said. ”I want the Tunisian and German government to tell me what happened to my son. We want the truth. Why did they kill him? He was a suspect they could have gotten more information from him, had they captured him alive. Was he a terrorist? No, my son was not a terrorist.” "
"South Korea’s President Park Awaits Her Fate, Dejected, Sleepless and Alone - The New York Times","SEOUL, South Korea  —   As the protests against her have grown larger, louder and closer, and her career, reputation and presidency march inexorably toward an impeachment vote on Friday, President Park   has kept mostly hidden from public view, gripped by   and despair, and largely alone. Cloistered in the presidential Blue House, which in a twist of fate befitting a Greek tragedy is also her childhood home, she has had few visitors, aides said. At 64, she is not married and has no children. Her brother and sister have been estranged from her for years. Her three most trusted aides have been fired over the corruption and   scandal that now threatens to undo her presidency. One has been jailed. Ms. Park’s closest friend and confidante, Choi   is also in jail. Ms. Park has stopped attending cabinet and presidential staff meetings. She has been dejected, she said in one public apology, losing “countless nights” of sleep and at times regretting ever becoming president. “She has grown noticeably wan,” said Chung   the floor leader of Ms. Park’s governing party, Saenuri, who visited her in the Blue House on Tuesday. “She said a few times that she was sorry to our lawmakers. ” Since the scandal began to break into public view in October, over allegations that Ms. Park conspired with Ms. Choi to extort tens of millions of dollars from big businesses and to help Ms. Choi, who had no official post, manipulate government affairs from the shadows, Ms. Park has rarely been seen in public. She last met a foreign visitor on Nov. 10, when she greeted a presidential delegation from Kazakhstan, the same day she spoke on the phone with   Donald J. Trump. She has delivered three televised apologies, each only several minutes long, sometimes choking with emotion. “My heart is crushed,” she said, “when I think I cannot resolve the deep disappointment and anger of the people even if I apologize 100 times. ” She was said to have heard the weekly protests calling for her to leave office. Those protests have grown from 20, 000 people in central Seoul six weeks ago to about 1. 7 million on Saturday, who came within a few hundred feet of her compound, shouting, “Evict her!” “The president heard the people’s voices with a heavy heart,” Jung   Ms. Park’s spokesman, said after one of the protests, though he did not clarify whether she heard the protesters’ shouts through her window or, as one South Korean news outlet has reported, watched them on TV. Beyond that, her aides have declined to discuss her daily routine or her mood these days, except to say that she was taking the crisis gravely and was doing her best to deal with it. They said she had invited Christian leaders and a top Buddhist monk to visit her last month to offer advice on the crisis. Her office did not disclose what they told her, except that the monk had quoted Buddhist scripture, saying, “A tree bears fruit when it sheds flowers. ” For many in South Korea, the flower has already fallen. As Ms. Park’s approval rating has plummeted, shop owners across the country have pulled down pictures of her they once hung proudly on the wall. Even in her hometown, Daegu, where she made a brief visit last week, she was confronted by protesters demanding her resignation. After visiting a   market that had been heavily damaged in a fire, her office said, she returned to her car and wept. Possibly the last time a South Korean leader was this isolated was in 2008, when massive crowds had rallied in central Seoul for weeks to protest President Lee  ’s decision to lift a ban on American beef imports amid fears of mad cow disease. At the time, Mr. Lee said he climbed Mount Bugak, the cool green peak that rises above the Blue House, in the evening, saw the protesters’ candlelight filling the city center and wept. For Ms. Park, the Blue House itself is ablaze with memories. She first moved there at age 9, when her father, Maj. Gen. Park   seized power in a military coup in 1961. At 22, after her mother was killed in an assassination attempt against her father, she became his acting first lady. In 1979, after her father was assassinated amid widespread protests against his dictatorship, she left the presidential palace, only to return as president in 2013. In between, she lived a secluded life in southern Seoul, in a house plastered with photos of her dead parents and adorned with their relics. “Her home was more like a museum for Park ” Choi   an editorial writer at the South Korean daily JoongAng Ilbo, wrote recently of his visit there a decade ago. “It looked as if her clock had stopped in the 1970s and she spent much time communicating with her dead father. ” Mr. Choi described the atmosphere there as “heavy and dark. ” In her 1993 memoir, “What If I Were Born in an Ordinary Family,” Ms. Park wrote of her tragic family history and her sadness: “In my life’s scale, the worthwhile times have never outweighed painful ones. ” In the end, Ms. Park’s cloistered life may have set the stage for her political implosion. She has said she often spends evenings alone reading government reports. She shuns    meetings with senior aides. Her former cook told a South Korean magazine that she usually ate alone, watching TV. She has said she cut ties with her brother and sister to prevent nepotism, a bane of past South Korean presidents. She has two dogs, white Jindos, a Korean breed prized for its loyalty. But in an episode that has haunted her presidency, when the ferry Sewol sank in 2014, killing more than 300 people in one of the country’s biggest disasters in decades, her chief of staff said he could not locate her for seven hours. Where she was during those crucial hours has been one of the most jealously guarded secrets of her office, spawning lurid rumors. Her office recently said that she was in her residence, not in her main work office, at the time and that she did receive reports about the sinking. In testimony before a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday, her former chief of staff, Kim   said only that he did not know where in the sprawling compound she was. “I only knew that she was somewhere in the Blue House,” he said. “I didn’t know well what was going on in her personal life in her residence. ” Her trusted friend and adviser all these years was Choi   whose family had befriended her while her father was still in power. After becoming president, Ms. Park has said that she continued to rely on Ms. Choi to look after her wardrobe and other personal affairs. Prosecutors said Ms. Choi did far more than that, and they have indicted her on extortion and other charges. While Ms. Park cannot be indicted while she holds office, the indictment of Ms. Choi identified Ms. Park as a criminal  accomplice, a first for a president. In her apologies, a   Ms. Park has said she could not forgive herself for letting her guard down with Ms. Choi, who she said had helped her during her “lonely” and “difficult times. ” But she admitted no legal wrongdoing. By this time, few Koreans trusted her. According to opinion polls, she had become the least popular president since South Korea began democratizing in the late 1980s. She has tried to restore a semblance of normalcy to her besieged administration by making appointments of ambassadors and deputy cabinet ministers. Her government also pressed ahead with signing a controversial military intelligence sharing pact with Japan. It all may be too little, too late, and the crowds outside the Blue House on a recent Saturday evinced little sympathy. “If you are so lonely,” some chanted, “why don’t you go and join Choi   in her prison cell?”"

"Penny Nance: Stopping Merrick Garland Will Be a ‘Cage Match,’ ‘Most Important Battle of Our Lives’ - Breitbart","Penny Nance, president of Concerned Women For America, warns on Breitbart News Daily that conservatives face the most important battle of their lives in opposing Obama’s liberal Supreme Court pick, Merrick Garland. [“This is a very important moment in the republic. This is why the people gave the Senate back to the Republicans. This is a check and balance in a president who’s out of control,” Nance told host Stephen K. Bannon.  The media, Obama, and the Democratic party will place enormous pressure on Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley and Mitch McConnell to confirm Garland, according to Nance. “It is going to be a cage match  …     This is the most important battle of our lives,” she recalled saying to hundreds of volunteer leaders in her group. “This battle  —   what hangs in the balance is every issue every one of your listeners care about,” she said, naming concerns from preserving the Second Amendment to traditional marriage. “The New York Times placed [Merrick Garland]  …     to the left of [Justice Elena] Kagan. So this is a very liberal nominee. Of course. This is such a liberal president who thinks the Constitution is a living, breathing document. ” “The Court hangs in the balance now,” she continued. “And this next pick will decide for generations to come, for the next forty or maybe fifty years of what is going to happen on all the issues we care about. And by the way, this is not just going to be one pick. The next administration will choose two or three more. ” “In over eighty years, there hasn’t been a Supreme Court nominee confirmed in the last year of a president’s administration. We’re not going to change that now just because the Democrats want their way. This is so much bigger. The Senate’s doing their job. We need to encourage and thank them for that,” she added.

Arianna Huffington’s Sleep Revolution Starts at Home - The New York Times,"Arianna Huffington was sitting like a very relaxed queen in her SoHo bedroom on a thronelike bergère chair covered in brocade Fortuny fabric. It was time to wind down, 8 p. m. Behind her, an embroidered throw pillow announced: “Sleep your way to the top. ” The phrase recalls a TED Talk she gave in 2010, and it isn’t about sex, thank you. It is about sleeping. “I was making a speech about sleep as a performance enhancer,” she said. “As opposed to being lazy or not engaged with life. ” One wouldn’t think that about one of the most powerful women in the world, the author of 15 books and a founder of a news site that sold to AOL for $315 million in 2011. But of all the things on her agenda, which would exhaust most mortals, sleep is at the top. Her new book, “The Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life, One Night at a Time” (Harmony) is a call to bed. It is also inspiring a turbocharged national tour that involves “sleep fairs” at colleges and an educational “takeover” of a JetBlue flight during which she gave out books and answered questions. “I want to rekindle our romance with sleep,” said Ms. Huffington, 65, in a lullaby voice as soothing as her floral perfume. “It’s a central part of life and a gateway to our dreams. ” If sleep is a gateway to her dreams, then her bedroom is the mother ship. It is one of four in a vast apartment she transformed a few years ago with the help of the designer Steven Gambrel. “It was a minimalist loft,” she said. “But I wanted something that felt more   and European. ” To achieve that, she hired Mr. Gambrel to add walls to break up the space, for which he also designed much of the furniture. Peter Mucek, the decorative painter, plastered the walls to emulate a golden Venetian glow. Michael S. Smith, who redecorated some rooms in the Obama White House and is a friend, suggested that she treat the loft’s concrete columns with metallic brown paint to give them an ancient bronze feel. Mr. Smith also designed some leather chairs and an ottoman. Her home now has a regal and romantic ambience that seems in perfect keeping with Ms. Huffington’s personality. Everything in the decidedly   bedroom is as carefully considered as a business move. On a bed surrounded with Fortuny curtains in a restful light blue, she sleeps on organic cotton sheets from a collection called Huffington. The Huffington line, carried by   a nearby bedding shop, was designed by her daughter Isabella Huffington, 25, an artist who shares her home. Her pillows are stuffed with soporific hops and barley. Across the room are two Gordon Parks photographs, including the bucolic “Boy With June Bug. ” Over her night stand is a photograph of her other daughter, Christina, now 27, at Isabella’s christening. “I call it a joy trigger,” Ms. Huffington said, “and I like having it right by my bed. ” Her night stand functions as a kind of altar to Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams. The books are inspirational, including works by Rumi, the   Persian poet, and Marcus Aurelius, whom Ms. Huffington admires because he was a multitasking Roman emperor and not easily ruffled. There is a simple alarm clock from Pottery Barn without any of the pesky digital lights she bans from her bedroom and from her hotel rooms. (She packs masking tape to obscure their blinking.) Roses and peonies rest in a vase by a journal with a black cover decorated by Isabella. Next to it is a pen light. “So if I wake up in the middle of the night, I can write down my dreams without turning on the light,” she said. Dreams, of course, are welcome business ideas, not so much. On a desk and dresser across the room, which she can’t reach from her bed, Ms. Huffington has several china Herend Rothschild bird bowls to hold such workaday items as   and manuscript clips, and a lacquered box for her packed appointment book. “I hide the whole mess to forget about it,” she said, lifting and setting down lids like a cook. At bedtime, her phone and electronic devices are relegated to the foyer outside the bedroom, to recharge under a wall of family photographs. Withdrawing from her machines, she said, is part of a   “transition to sleep” ritual that includes writing down the many things she is grateful for dimming the lights taking a warm bath in Epsom salts by flickering candlelight and changing into a silk nightgown to greet sleep with respect. “I used to sleep in the same thing I wore during the day,” said Ms. Huffington, whose call to rest came in 2007, when she fell down from exhaustion and broke her cheekbone. “It’s better to have special clothes for sleeping. ” It also helps to have soundproofed windows, which required a complicated and expensive installation process that made her renovated home as quiet as a church. Indeed, her cellphone rings with the sound of cathedral chimes. “I love church bells, don’t you?” she asked in a seductive purr. It was time for a tour of the rest of the apartment. It is one of her two homes and very different from the one she has in California. “My other house is from the 1920s, in Brentwood, in L. A.,” she said as she swept into her living room. “When I step out the door there, it’s into a garden of entirely white flowers, where all I smell is gardenias and it feels like being in the country. Here, it’s children, dogs and people from all over the world on my street when I walk out, and my favorite shops and restaurants. ” Her spacious living area  —   with a custom bookcase, a gilded Louis XV desk, gilded bronze and cobalt   candelabra and a   Italian mirror above the fireplace  —   has the feeling of something between a papal chamber and the Oval Office. “Isn’t this beautiful?” she asks, gesturing to a   screen by Mr. Mucek that hides a small white kitchen area, where she doesn’t concern herself with cooking. Just the same, Ms. Huffington loves to hold the many dinners that she doesn’t prepare at a   faux marble dining table. “I know how to make a really great cheese plate,” she said. She makes tea, too. Near the front door is a portrait of a woman by Françoise Gilot, which Ms. Gilot, who spent 10 years with Picasso, gave Ms. Huffington around the time Ms. Huffington was writing “Picasso: Creator and Destroyer,” published in 1988. The portrait of her daughters is by Nelson Shanks, who also painted Bill Clinton, Pope John Paul II and Diana, Princess of Wales. “But what I love most of all are the works of my daughter Isabella,” she said. As if on cue, Isabella emerged from an art studio next to her bedroom. (Christina has her own place.) The two put their arms around each other. The daughter, as it turns out, also respects a good night’s sleep. “Even in college, I’d get nine hours of sleep a night,” said Isabella, who is as tall and graceful as her mother and whose pretty collages have a dark political edge. “Remember when you’d visit, and my friends were pulling   and you’d lecture them about it?” Her mother laughed. No need for that at home. It was 10 o’clock, and with a television appearance scheduled for early the next day, time to dim the lights and take the moment seriously. “My sleep ritual is about to begin,” Ms. Huffington said with a beatific smile. She looked to the double doors leading to her bedroom. “My gateway calls. ” The church bells on her phone were ringing. She ignored them."
Pastors take to pulpit to protest IRS limits on political endorsements,"Washington (CNN) Pastors across the country are taking to their pulpits this Sunday to protest an Internal Revenue Service law that they say limits their religious freedom. Pulpit Freedom Sunday is an initiative started in 2008 by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative     focused on defending religious liberty. ”The ultimate goal of Pulpit Freedom Sunday is to restore a pastor’s right to speak freely from the pulpit without fearing government censorship or punishment,” said Erik Stanley, senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom. ”The IRS currently holds the power to impose legal sanctions on a church for something its pastor preaches from the pulpit.” As a senator, Lyndon B. Johnson backed a change in the US tax code that blocked some   organizations, including churches, from supporting or opposing political candidates. ”Until 1954, America’s pastors had the right to speak freely they exercised that right responsibly,” Stanley said. ”Churches were not turned into political action committees and party bosses did not set up shop in the basement of churches. Instead, pastors spoke out as they believed their faith intersected with something that was happening in an election. Pastors should have the right to decide that issue for themselves.” Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has pledged to repeal the ”Johnson Amendment” should he win. ”The Johnson Amendment has blocked our pastors and ministers and others from speaking their minds from their own pulpits,” he said at the Values Voter Summit last month.  ”If they want to talk about Christianity, if they want to preach, if they want to talk about politics, they’re unable to do so. If they want to do it, they take a tremendous risk that they lose their   status,” he said. ”All religious leaders should be able to freely express their thoughts and feelings on religious matters. And I will repeal the Johnson Amendment if I am elected your president, I promise. So important.” Hillary Clinton campaign did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the Johnson Amendment. The IRS told CNN that federal privacy laws prohibit the agency from commenting on any individual taxpayer or case. But Jim Garlow, lead pastor of Skyline Church in San Diego, has tried to get the IRS to comment on this issue for years. ”We record our sermons, as have many several thousands of pastors, and then send their sermons to the IRS in the hopes of provoking a lawsuit. But we have not been successful,” he said. Although ADF advocates for more traditional social issues like marriage and abortion, the group is not endorsing a candidate or encouraging pastors to address certain issues. ”ADF remains firmly committed to the goal that Pulpit Freedom Sunday is not about any particular issue or candidate or election, but is about restoring the right of pastors to speak freely from their pulpits and removing the censorship and punishment power from the IRS,” Stanley said.  Trump supporter Tony Perkins, president of the socially conservative Family Research Council, said that although pastors don’t need to choose a candidate, they do need the freedom to do so if they want. ”As a pastor, you have a biblical responsibility to speak to your congregation and help them understand the issues and how they line up with Scripture,” he said. ”We’re simply going down the list of biblical issues like life and human sexuality and marriage and speaking to what Scripture has to say and juxtaposing that with the positions of the candidates.” But not all clergy are in favor of religious leaders using the pulpit to make political endorsements. Broderick Greer, curate at  . Luke’s Episcopal Church in Memphis, Tennessee, believes support for Pulpit Freedom Sunday is due to more conservative leaders losing influence in an increasingly diverse climate.  ”I don’t see our relationship with the people we’re serving as one of paternalism,” he said. ”I would never want to tell people who they should vote for.” ”If you want to lose your   status, then feel free to make an endorsement from your pulpit. If you don’t then, you don’t,” he added. ”I think the broader question is should religious organizations have   status at all.”"
SiriusXM Announces Suspension of Glenn Beck over Brad Thor Interview Comments - Breitbart,"SiriusXM hosts Stephen K. Bannon and David Webb announced on Breitbart News Daily that SiriusXM has suspended Glenn Beck and Webb will temporarily take over Beck’s 9AM to noon Eastern time slot on SiriusXM’s Patriot Channel 125. [SiriusXM issued the following statement:  SiriusXM encourages a diversity of discourse and opinion on our talk programs. However, comments recently made by a guest on the independently produced Glenn Beck Program, in our judgement, may be reasonably construed by some to have been advocating harm against an individual currently running for office, which we cannot and will not condone. For that reason, we have suspended The Glenn Beck Program from our Patriot channel for the coming week and are evaluating its place in our lineup going forward. SiriusXM is committed to a spirited, robust, yet responsible political conversation and believes this action reflects those values. The suspension is in response to the interview Beck did with fiction author Brad Thor last Wednesday, in which Thor likened the GOP’s presumptive nominee Donald Trump to a South   dictator who would cause an “  event” for the country if elected. Thor then declared that in such a case, Congress would not be able to remove Trump from office by “legal means” through impeachment, so Thor asked “what patriot will step up and do that” if Trump oversteps his Constitutional restraints. Beck agreed with Thor’s assessment. Here is the exchange: THOR: He is a danger to America and I got to ask you a question and this is serious and this could ring down incredible heat on me because I’m about to suggest something very bad. It is a hypothetical I am going to ask as a thriller writer. With the feckless, spineless Congress we have, who will stand in the way of Donald Trump overstepping his constitutional authority as President? If Congress won’t remove him from office, what patriot will step up and do that if, if, he oversteps his mandate as president, his   authority, I should say, as president. If he oversteps that, how do we get him out of office? And I don’t think there is a legal means available. I think it will be a terrible, terrible position the American people will be in to get Trump out of office because you won’t be able to do it through Congress. BECK: I would agree with you on that and I don’t think you actually have the voices we’ve been talking about and we’ve been talking about this   for a while. I think the voices like ours go away. I don’t think we are allowed  —   especially if things, and I believe the economy is going to go to crap, even if Jesus was in office. It’s going to naturally reset. It has to. Read the rest of the exchange here. After receiving criticism for these comments from people who believed Thor and Beck were suggesting or at least implying assassination, Beck offered a lengthy defense of his statements. You can read the full transcript of his defense here.

The courage of Glen Campbell," (CNN) Who would have thought a    man with Alzheimer’s would make a music video, win a Grammy for best country song and be nominated for an Academy Award? This is the legacy of the inimitable Glen Campbell. Directing and producing ”Glen Campbell . .. I’ll Be Me” changed my life and that of my producing partner, Trevor Albert.  Julian Raymond, who had produced Glen’s past two albums, asked us in the summer of 2011 to do a short film documenting Glen’s final   tour, which would promote his new (and last) album, ”Ghost on the Canvas.” Glen had just been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, and his family and management team were worried about sharing this news. Glen and his wife, Kim, knew it was risky to go public with the diagnosis and for Glen to perform live while showing growing signs of the disease. The unforgettable Glen Campbell, Glen wanted to tell his story and not shy away from the reality he was facing. The Campbells learned that millions were coping with the fatal disease (5. 5 million Americans have Alzheimer’s every 68 seconds, someone new is diagnosed). Glen was showing increasing signs of dementia, but he loved the stage and hoped to keep performing as long as he could.  Julian told the Campbells that I had produced a movie about Johnny Cash, ”Walk the Line,” and that Trevor had produced great upbeat movies such as ”Groundhog Day.”  He stressed that we could be trusted to protect Glen’s dignity. That said, Trevor and I were very reluctant to make the film. All the other films we had seen about people with Alzheimer’s were dark, depressing and tough to get an audience for. Julian insisted that we all get together and discuss it in person. Is Alzheimer’s disease preventable? We were excited about the idea of meeting meet Glen and his family, having always loved his music and   humor, but we really didn’t want to lead the Campbells on. We told Julian to make sure they knew we might not do the film. Then we met the Campbells.  It didn’t matter how bleak we had found the other movies that addressed Alzheimer’s. With the Campbells, we knew immediately that we could make a unique film on the subject    one with music, laughter and faith    that would show Glen’s beautiful and caring family encouraging him to sing and entertain and embrace life even as his disease progressed.  How to make an impact on Alzheimer’s, Glen and Kim were still playful and in love after 30 years of marriage, and music filled their lives. Our decision was an instant YES.  Kim was and is devoted to Glen, and we quickly recognized that she was one of the strongest, most compassionate and most   examples around of the millions of caregivers who support loved ones every day. Their children, Ashley, Cal and Shannon, were cut from the same cloth. They all knew that what we were doing made Glen and the family vulnerable, but they wanted to do it because Glen wanted to do it.  Glen asked us to do a movie that showed the gnarly truth. He knew what he had and what he faced. Glen, calling the illness ”part timers,” announced ”I ain’t done yet!” and responded the opposite of a person given the news he had a disease that would take his mind, his memory and eventually his life. He wanted to sing, laugh and celebrate life until it was taken from him.  We thought the tour would last a few months at most. Glen was able to defy all the odds and perform 151 shows over a      period.  The highs far outweighed the lows, but there were lows. Everywhere we went Glen radiated love and light, and even in the dark times of his confusion, he always showed signs of his true self. He was surrounded by loving family and fans who lifted him up when he was at his most exposed.  After 151 shows, the disease had taken its toll and Glen and his family decided he should take his final bow. But the movie will allow generations to come to appreciate Glen’s incredible courage, talent and spirit. We have come a long way from being reluctant filmmakers to starting a fund to help those suffering. Along with the Volunteers of America, we have now formed the I’ll Be Me Alzheimer’s Fund (IBMAF. org) to raise money to find a cure, restore the spirit of the caregiver and bring media attention to the Alzheimer’s tsunami that we are all facing.  It is so profoundly sad to see a person lose the memory of their life and family. Taking the journey with Glen and his family will forever be one the most important personal experiences and films of my career. He was our teacher on how to face life on life’s terms. He was and is a true hero.  Glen risked compromising his image by doing this movie and showing Alzheimer’s   and personal. No celebrity or family has been quite so public about the effect of Alzheimer’s. The Campbells’ courage and honesty has allowed millions of caregivers and those suffering from the disease to be seen and understood as never before in an uplifting and inspirational way.  We offer unending gratitude to the Campbell family. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook. .  Read CNNOpinion’s Flipboard magazine.     "

"Walter Cronkite Awards Dub Jake Tapper, Jorge Ramos, &amp Katy Tur Best Reporters of 2016","This year’s Walter Cronkite Awards for Excellence in Television Political Journalism have named Jorge Ramos of Univision and Fusion TV networks, Katy Tur of NBC News, and Jake Tapper of CNN as the best national journalists of the 2016 election. [Tapper was honored for “his fearless advocacy for the truth throughout the election cycle. Jurors said his interviewing ‘relentlessness’ held officials to account and equipped voters with valuable information from the candidates. Forceful when necessary, refusing to let candidates slip away from important questions, he was praised for his ‘tenacious commitment to sorting fact from fiction, a quality essential to journalism. ’”  Much of Tapper’s reporting focused on issues that ended up on the periphery of the campaign discussion. He focused on the controversy over whether former President Obama was born in the United States, David Duke’s unsolicited endorsement of Trump, remarks Trump never endorsed about the death of former Clinton White House official Vince Foster, and accusations Trump was behind rioting at or near his rallies. He was involved in a few journalistic controversies during the campaign. In one, he appeared to play a deceptively edited clip of Hillary Clinton to set up a question for Trump surrogate Chris Christie. In another, which turned up in leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee, Tapper’s producer appeared to solicit friendly questions for a party operative who was to appear on his weekday show. Tapper had booked Luis Miranda of the Democratic National Committee for his show The Lead. His producer emailed: “Thanks for facilitating Luis coming on today, and bearing with us through a meelee (sic) of GOP nonsense and cancellations and all that. Any particular points he’ll want to make?” This email was forwarded to Democratic staffers with the line “Need to know asap if we want to offer Jake Tapper questions to ask us. ” Later, one came from Miranda that said, “Any particularly good hit we want to dump on Tapper today?” Tapper vehemently denied taking orders from the DNC, stating that he has “never been given questions to ask any politician. ” Ramos, who works for the Univision and Fusion networks, had his share of   with the Trump campaign. In addition, his daughter worked for President Obama until she joined the Clinton campaign. He was removed by Secret Service from a Trump campaign press event when he attempted to talk over the reporter Trump had called on so he could ask a question about Trump’s plan to build a wall along the Mexican border. Trump had Ramos brought back into the room to ask his question, and Ramos launched into a tirade, saying, “You cannot deport 11 million people. ” Ramos, who won for “advancing the conversation about what divides us as a country,” the judges wrote, spent much of the campaign assailing Trump’s immigration policies. He attacked “Kate’s Law”  —   named in honor of Kathryn Steinle, a California woman murdered by an illegal immigrant in the “sanctuary city” of San Francisco  —   which attempts to discourage   for any illegal immigrant convicted of an aggravated felony in the U. S. and then deported. Tur, who made a point of saying in nearly every report how long she had covered Trump, called him “unscripted and undisciplined” and on several occasions attempted to present the views of supporters she purportedly talked to at campaign events as those of the official campaign. She used a remark by the president’s son to launch racism accusations against Trump supporters. Just last month, she fired off a series of tweets over Trump’s assertion that the media went light on covering terrorism. “Every time we ding Trump’s demonstrably false claim press doesn’t cover terror, we talk about terror which is exactly what the WH wants. ” And why did the White House want terrorism covered? “Because talking terror stands to positively influence public opinion on Trump’s travel ban. ” Then, when the White House responded with a lengthy list of terror incidents the press all but ignored, Tur tweeted that the list was incomplete. “WH list makes no mention of any attacks in Israel. ” Tur, according to the Cronkite Awards, “wins for ‘courage under pressure,’ a ‘complete fluency and mastery’ of the subject matter and an ability to convey it ‘effortlessly’ on live television, whether in the field, at a press conference or in the studio. Providing unique insight into Trump voters, she displayed ‘grit and perseverance’ demonstrating the honor of her profession. ” Announcing the winners, USC Annenberg Professor and Lear Center Director Marty Kaplan said, “Today, at this seriously dangerous moment for our democracy, these Cronkite Awards honor journalists, stations and networks stepping up to their civic responsibility to tell Americans the truth. ” The trophies will be presented at the National Press Club in Washington, D. C. on Friday, April 28 at an   ceremony."
"Obama, Saying Goodbye, Warns of Threats to National Unity - The New York Times","CHICAGO  —   President Obama, delivering a farewell address in the city that launched his political career, declared on Tuesday his continued confidence in the American experiment. But he warned, in the wake of a toxic presidential election, that economic inequity, racism and   threatened to shred the nation’s democratic fabric. “We weaken those ties when we define some of us as more American than others,” Mr. Obama said, “when we write off the whole system as inevitably corrupt, and when we sit back and blame the leaders we elect without examining our own role in electing them. ” Speaking to a rapturous crowd that recalled the excitement of his   campaign in 2008, Mr. Obama said he believed even the deepest ideological divides could be bridged. His words were nevertheless etched with frustration  —   a blunt coda to a remarkable day that laid bare many of the racial crosscurrents in the country. On Capitol Hill, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama presented himself as a moderate in his confirmation hearing for attorney general, while his critics denounced him as a racist. In Charleston, S. C. Dylann S. Roof, the white supremacist who shot nine black churchgoers, was sentenced to death. And here, in the cavernous convention hall where Mr. Obama celebrated his   in 2012, the nation’s first black president  —   still popular, still optimistic  —   bade America goodbye 10 days before turning over his office to   Donald J. Trump, who ran what his critics labeled a racist campaign. Mr. Obama pledged again to support his successor. But his speech was a thinly veiled rebuke of several of the positions Mr. Trump staked out during the campaign, from climate change and barring Muslims from entering the country to repealing his landmark health care law. “If every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and undeserving minorities,” Mr. Obama said, “then workers of all shades will be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclave. ” “If we decline to invest in the children of immigrants, just because they don’t look like us, we diminish the prospects of our own children  —   because those brown kids will represent a larger share of America’s work force,” he added. In giving a farewell address, Mr. Obama invoked a privilege of presidents going back to George Washington. He staked his claim as the leader who steered the nation through the storms of the Great Recession to a growing economy and job market. He claimed credit for reducing the rate of uninsured Americans to record lows, while keeping a cap on health care costs. In a pointed reference to Republicans determined to repeal the health care bill that was one of the signature accomplishments of his presidency, Mr. Obama said, “If anyone can put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements we’ve made to our health care system  —   that covers as many people at less cost  —   I will publicly support it. ” There were also nostalgic moments, as well. He recalled the 2008 campaign that started him on his improbable journey to the White House. He thanked the army of volunteers and staff members who swept him into the Oval Office, ending with the iconic chant, “Yes, we can. ” And reflecting on all they had accomplished, he added, “Yes, we did. ” “It has been the honor of my life to serve you,” Mr. Obama said. “I won’t stop in fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days. ” He drew some of the most thunderous applause of the night when he paid tribute to his wife, Michelle  —   “my best friend”  —   and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.  —   “a brother. ” As the crowd of 18, 000 clapped and stamped their feet, Mr. Obama dabbed his eyes. Afterward, Mrs. Obama and her elder daughter, Malia, appeared onstage with the president, along with Mr. Biden and his wife, Jill. The Obamas’ younger daughter, Sasha, stayed in Washington because she has an exam in school on Wednesday morning, the White House said. But Mr. Obama clearly wanted to use his last major turn on the national stage to send a message. Americans, he said, should not take their democracy for granted. Lamenting the perennially low voter turnout rates, Mr. Obama urged people to become involved. “If you’re tired of arguing with strangers on the internet,” he said, “try to talk with one in real life. ” “America is not a fragile thing,” the president said. “But the gains of our long journey to freedom are not assured. ” The White House had meticulously planned this event, from the location to the tone and cadence of the speech, which clearly reached for the oratorical heights of his   addresses. The president was still rewriting his remarks on Tuesday afternoon, one of his aides said, after being up very late Monday night scrawling edits on what was then already the fourth draft. Mr. Obama’s chief speechwriter, Cody Keenan, pored over previous farewell addresses for inspiration. George Washington used the occasion to disclose he would not run for a third term and warned Americans to steer clear of foreign entanglements in Europe, while Dwight D. Eisenhower warned of the influence of the “  complex. ” Mr. Obama’s message recalled his final State of the Union address last year, as well as speeches he gave in Springfield, Ill. at the commencement ceremonies at Howard University and Rutgers University and during the Democratic National Convention. Dozens of alumni from the White House and Mr. Obama’s political operation converged on Chicago to cheer their boss. With parties all over town, the atmosphere felt like a wistful version of 2012, or even more so, of 2008, when Mr. Obama’s election drew a   people to a jubilant victory celebration in nearby Grant Park. There was, however, an undeniable tinge of sadness to Mr. Obama’s    —   the dread among many in this crowd that his legacy will be undone by Mr. Trump, and the disappointment that, for all his political gifts, he was unable to hand over his office to his chosen successor, Hillary Clinton. “Beers and tears,” said Ben LaBolt, who served as the national press secretary for Mr. Obama’s   campaign. Many said they had waited hours in the cold to get tickets, like   McGee, an elementary school teacher from the Chicago suburb Country Club Hills. Those hours had a purpose. She wanted to demonstrate to her students that seeing Mr. Obama was worth the wait. “Better than waiting to shop on Black Friday. Better than waiting in line for gym shoes,” she said. But Ms. McGee was troubled by Mr. Trump’s inauguration, and the damage it could do to Mr. Obama’s legacy. “There’s so much to say about him,” she said. “He maintained class, he maintained dignity. Honestly, I don’t want him to leave, but I’m sure it will be a load off his shoulders. ” Alvin Love, a Baptist minister, walked through the crowd holding the hand of his    granddaughter, Bayleigh Love, who wore a red sequined party dress. He and Mr. Obama go back 30 years, when the president was a young community organizer on the South Side. “It’s mixed emotions for me,” he said. “I’m sad to see it come to an end, but proud and happy to see the work that he’s done. ” Mr. Love said he believed Mr. Obama’s work could be sustained, even with the advent of a Trump presidency. “Any time right is done, it will sooner or later stand up again. ”"
"Snapchat put beds in the lofts it’s using as offices, but neighbors suspect nobody lives there","’  ’ ’   The day Snapchat brought in the bed was a weird day in the   office. Next came the hangers in the closet with clothes on them   and the pictures of random people on the walls. ’ ’   Before long, it looked like Snapchat had set up an apartment   inside the office, a former employee told Business Insider. ’ ’   ”It was like an IKEA set up, but nobody really slept there,” the     said. ’ ”   Adding a bed wasn’t just a new office perk. ” ”   For the last 18 months, Snapchat has been inspected by the city   of Los Angeles for its use of the Thornton Lofts apartment   spaces, which the company uses as offices. The beds were hauled   in ahead of an inspection by city officials, the former employee   claims, to give the impression that someone was living there when   really it was just more office space for Snapchat’s growing staff   to sprawl into. ” ’   A Snapchat representative said that the company was in compliance   with regulations, but declined to comment further on the matter   or provide information about who lives in the units. ’ ’   Yet some of the neighbors were suspicious. ’ ”   According to case records obtained by Business Insider through a     request, Snapchat’s office at 619 S. Ocean Front   Walk came under inspection by the LA Department of Building and   Safety starting in March 2015 after somebody complained that it   was being converted into another use. ” ’   The first complaint said that residents ”believe that a   commercial   use is being housed in the entire   building, when part of it is supposed to be residential condo   units.” ’ ’   The second complaint was more direct and included the other   office space it had been renting. ’ ’   ”The 10 residential units in the combined projects at 619 and 701   Ocean Front Walk are being used by Snapchat Inc. primarily for   office and not residential uses,” alleged the complaint. ’ ’   Parking spaces that were supposed to be available to the   community were also removed, according to the complaint. ’ ”   The friction with the neighbors and the unusual office   arrangement provide a revealing window into the rapid growth at   Snapchat, which has become one of the most popular apps among   teens, even as its operations have remained closely guarded by   the company’s penchant for secrecy and its Los Angeles home base,   hundreds of miles away from most of its internet rivals. ” ’   When an inspector toured the property in May, escorted by a   lawyer, he noted a kitchen, a shower, and a ”bedroom with a bed   and closet with clothing.” Alongside it were ”several docking   stations for computers used for commercial services.” Another     form notes that one condo included at least eight   desks set up. ’ ’   The condo units  as ” ” spaces, which means that Snapchat   would be allowed to use the apartments for work. But the units   must also have a resident, and it’’s unclear who is ”living” in   the Snapchat office. ’ ’  ’ ’   The furniture was added to make it look like someone was living   there in compliance, according to the   but no one   ever did. ’ ’   Instead, the perk of working in one of these      apartments meant that Snapchat employees would hit the beach and   then shower off in the bathroom. For people working late or on   odd shifts, there was a bed to nap on. The employees worked   around the fake photos on the walls and ignored the hangers in   the closets. ’ ’   On June 15, the inspector closed the case for the LA Department   of Building and Safety and referred it to the Los Angeles housing   department. ’ ’   Based in Venice, the $18 billion company has struggled to build   its   empire to match the pace of its growth. Snapchat   built its campus by expanding into small office buildings   throughout the eclectic neighborhood, instead of planting its   roots in a corporate office park, as its rivals up in Silicon   Valley have. ’ ’   That sprawl, though, has presented its challenges, as shown by   the inspections spurred by worried neighbors. ’ ”   Its expansion hasn’t slowed, though, and the company  to expand out of Venice by taking   up space at the Santa Monica airport. ” ’The day Snapchat brought in the bed was a weird. ..’"
Watch: Obama in 2008 Boasts to Ohioans ’It Helps’ That Dems Are ’in Charge of’ Voting Machines - Breitbart,"Earlier on Tuesday, President Barack Obama accused Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump of “whining” for his repeated statements on the upcoming presidential election being “rigged” at a joint news conference with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.  “The notion that somehow if Mr. Trump loses Florida, it’s because of those people that you have to watch out for, that is both irresponsible and, by the way, doesn’t really show the kind of leadership and toughness that you want out of a president,” Obama said in response to a reporter’s question. “If you start whining before the game’s even over, if whenever things are going badly for you and you lose, you start blaming somebody else, then you don’t have what it takes to be in this job because there are a lot of times when things don’t go our way or my way. However, a rally at Kent State in Ohio in 2008,   presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama ( ) had a much different response to a similar question. After boasting that his Democratic Party were “in charge” of the voting machines, Obama admitted both sides had historically “monkeyed around with elections” to “tilt things in their direction. ” Exchange as follows: QUESTIONER: I would just like to know what you can say to reassure us that this election will not be rigged or stolen? SEN. BARACK OBAMA: Well, I tell you what, it helps in Ohio that we’ve got Democrats in charge of the machines. But, look, I come from Chicago. Some want to be honest, it is not as if it is just Republicans who have monkeyed around with elections in the past. Sometimes Democrats have, too. You know, whenever people are in power, they have this tendency to try to, you know, tilt things in their direction. That’s why we have got to have, I believe, of voting rights division in the Justice Department that is   and that is serious about investigating cases of voter fraud, is serious about making sure the people are not being discouraged to vote. That is why the voting rights legislation that was put in place a couple years ago to help the county clerks to make sure the machines were in place that were needed are important. That is why we need paper trails on these new electronic machines, so that you actually have something that you can hang on to after you punched that letter to make sure it has not been hacked into. I mean, those are all part of the process of making sure that our democracy works for everyone. And one of the great things about this election has been all the interest that has been taken in this election. I mean, when I spoke Thursday night, there were more of yours then watched the finals of “American Idol. ” Now that is big. That’s big. That’s big. And I hope a lot of people are watching the Republican convention. I want people to have information. Then I want to make sure that our democracy is working the way it should be. And this is near and dear to my heart because when I was a lawyer, I practiced voting rights law. And I filed a lot of lawsuits. In Illinois, I helped to make sure that you could go ahead and get registered at driver’s license facilities  —   at the DMV. So I’ve been working on this for a long time. I think the more people participate, the more they are paying attention ultimately, the better off everybody is. Immediately   Republican Party chairman Bob Bennett cried foul. Bennett issued a statement accusing Obama of “ ” and attacked   Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner by accusing her of “meddling” with the state’s elections system. “Barack Obama’s outrageous statements today basically amounted to an endorsement of  . That may be how you win elections back in Chicago, but Ohioans tend to frown upon the idea of massive voter fraud, especially when it’s floated by a presidential candidate. Jennifer Brunner’s meddling with Ohio’s elections system and her firing of elections officials for political reasons has been disturbing enough, but it now seems the   team are openly wearing the same partisan jersey. Ohioans will not stand for this blatant disregard for the integrity of our elections system. ”"
Trump: Obama ‘Has Done a Terrible Job For African-Americans’ - Breitbart,"On Sunday, with Martin Luther King Day right around the corner, George Stephanopoulos of ABC News asked Donald Trump what he would say to Americans, especially   who believe Dr. King’s dream has not been achieved. [“Oh, I agree with them, and especially under President Obama,” Trump replied.    “We have an   president and the black youth, the   youth, has essentially all never done worse. You look at the unemployment in the ’50s. You look at   people that are 30 and 35 and 40, in the height of their strength and lives, and they’re doing horribly. ” “President Obama, an   has done a terrible job for ” Trump concluded.  “Donald Trump will do a great job for  . I’ll bring back jobs to this country from China and many other places. And I’ll let people work and make a great living. I will be great for  . ” Trump is right about   unemployment being far worse than the national average, and the rates have been awful throughout the Obama presidency, although at the moment it’s not correct to say things have never been worse.   The black unemployment rate is always about double the national average.  As the general unemployment rate slowly settled back to “normal” in the final months of the Obama presidency, so too did the black unemployment rate fall below its 2008 and 2009 highs.  As of December, the white unemployment rate was 4. 5 percent, while it’s 9. 5 percent for blacks. However, The Atlantic notes that the current gap between black and white is still slightly larger than the gap from 15 years ago.  It’s even worse for those who lack advanced degrees.  The unemployment rate for white   dropouts is 6. 9 percent, but it’s nearly two and a half times higher, 16. 6 percent, for  .  At the other end of the educational spectrum, unemployment for Americans with a bachelor’s degree or higher is 2. 4 percent for whites, 4. 1 percent for blacks. By now we should all be familiar with the way unemployment statistics can be sliced and diced for political purposes, so it’s necessary to also consider the kind of   unemployment that falls completely off the media radar screen.   Even those most eager to hype the   “Obama recovery” have been forced to admit   haven’t benefited nearly as much as other demographics.  The black workforce is far smaller relative to the overall population than the white workforce is, while   on both Right and Left consistently find that average black wages are far lower.   One study found that over the past 15 years, the average hourly wage of black workers fell by 44 cents, while white and Hispanic wages rose by 48 and 45 cents during the same period.  Such wage gaps are often attributed to black Americans working in more   and temporary jobs, as well as jobs with high turnover rates, making it difficult for them to build careers. Another metric that has gotten steadily worse through the Obama years is the “wealth gap,” referring to the sum of income and valuable assets, most significantly, home ownership.   A study reported by Forbes in March claimed the typical black household now has only 6 percent of the wealth owned by the typical white household.  The report suggested several reasons for the disparity: Causes include the fact that blacks and Latinos are less likely to have jobs that include   health care, a retirement plan or paid time off. The net result is that families of color spend more of their savings on dealing with life’s emergencies such as    health care. Or, they have fewer   vehicles, such as   accounts, available to them. Other factors stem back to homeownership and education: A child whose parents were steered into a   neighborhood with a   school has decreased chances of obtaining a   degree, which also then cuts off future job opportunities. Additionally, although it is illegal, discrimination on the basis of race or national original endures, whether unconsciously or overtly. Of course, that’s what all discussions of black economic difficulty come back to: racial discrimination.  It’s an unquantifiable   that can be cited as the cause of every problem, since it can’t be measured with any accuracy.   It’s politically useful to say that insidious racism is the cause of “inequality,” and it’s impossible to “prove” it isn’t.  The size of the disparities in employment, wages, and wealth mentioned above is supposed to be taken as evidence of systemic racism in America, because nothing else could possibly explain those differences. This line of thinking prevents us from considering what those other explanations might be, which in turn makes it impossible to address them. If racism is the reason for black economic difficulties, we might ask how racism is supposedly getting worse under a black President who won two elections, and presides over the richest and most powerful regulatory state in the world.  As Forbes noted, racial discrimination is illegal, and the mightiest enforcement state ever created by Man works tirelessly to enforce that prohibition.   One does not hear many credible allegations that the government is ignoring serious complaints of racial discrimination, under either President Obama or his predecessors.  Among other things, it would be strongly contrary to the nature of bureaucracy to ignore the sort of complaints that make a bureau more prestigious and powerful  —   they’re not in the habit of downplaying the crises they exist to combat. One of the biggest problems facing black Americans is that they’ve been locked into destructive politics that keep pushing the same failed “solutions,” with alternative approaches considered beyond the pale.  Large numbers of black Americans live in cities that have been dominated by Democrat political machines for generations.  The same bogus federal remedies have been thrown at them for decades, under Administrations from both parties.   An increasingly expensive educational bureaucracy, coupled with a university system dominated by political correctness and   programs, have failed to deliver on the theory that education automatically confers wealth.  Instead,   are among the groups hardest hit by the Big Government and Big Business mania for importing cheap foreign labor, at both the low and high ends of the skill scale.  We spend more on education than ever, with more attention paid to getting minority youth into college than ever  …     but the inequality gap widens. The effort to confer   wealth by making it easier for people with shaky credit to take out mortgages produced the apocalyptic financial crisis of 2008  …     and it’s nevertheless being tried again, by people who remain convinced   is a benefit the government can bestow.  And yet, despite those incredible expenditures and the horrendous damage inflicted on our financial system by the crash, the wealth gap between white and black Americans grows larger.   It shouldn’t come as a surprise that “giving” someone a house doesn’t make them wealthy, if you also “give” them a mortgage debt they can’t afford.  The depressingly common outcome is foreclosure, and a family left worse off than ever.   Likewise, attempts at legislating higher income by raising minimum wages have the practical effect of abolishing the jobs   and marginal workers need to get into the game.  Forbes mentions the lack of health insurance as a factor in the   wealth gap ObamaCare “fixed” that by making everyone’s healthcare worth less, with exchange plans so wretched that huge numbers of health young people decided it was better to pay a fine than buy overpriced health coverage. Liberal social policies inflicted tremendous damage on the black family  —   the factor in that “wealth gap” nobody wants to discuss honestly.  There is simply no substitute for intact families accumulating wealth across generations, including the incredibly valuable intangible gifts that mothers and fathers can pass along to their children  —   from good work and study habits, to family connections that ease young people into the workforce.  Any employer will tell you that hiring young people for marginal jobs is a   endeavor.  Family and community reputation go a long way toward easing those jitters. The effect of the welfare state on our human capital has been horrendous as well, generation after generation.  It’s another of those truths our elites have stubbornly refused to confront during the Obama era: high unemployment is not only due to a lack of jobs offered, but a lack of jobs sought.  There are people from every demographic background chomping at the bit to work  …     and there are people, especially younger people, who won’t throw themselves into the workforce unless they absolutely must.  Demand for employment does influence supply.  Entrepreneurs who see themselves surrounded by eager, dependable workers will make different expansion decisions than those who think good help is hard to find in their community.  Entrepreneurial risk looks even riskier in communities that don’t enthusiastically seek investment, commerce, and employment. Is there racism mixed among those factors  —   including both racial discrimination by whites against black employees or entrepreneurs, and the reverse?  Certainly  …     and sadly there always will be, barring a significant upgrade to human nature over the coming generations.  The question is how to best minimize its effects.  There is no better answer than the flourishing of opportunity, which has been artificially suppressed by creeping statism for far too long.  Voluntary cooperation, in the pursuit of mutual profit, and vigorous competition have a way of dissolving prejudice.  It takes time, but patience is rewarded. Look at it this way: the Obama presidency brought us the ultimate example of the opposite viewpoint, which holds that imperfect citizens must be molded to virtue by the strong hand of an   State.  More spending than ever, more regulations, more enforcement, more   social and media pressure against racism  …     and the   economic gap got worse.   How much more evidence do we need that a different path must be tried, before we go bankrupt following this one, into a future of absurdly expensive social strife?  "
Bill Clinton: Hillary ‘Worked Like a Demon’ and Gets ‘Severely Dehydrated’ - Breitbart,"Former President Bill Clinton explained that Hillary Clinton has fainted before, as a result of dehydration, not any serious medical issue. [Clinton said that “on more than one occasion” over the years of her career ”the same sort of thing’s happened to her when she got severely dehydrated. ”  The former president made his comments during an interview with CBS reporter Charlie Rose, after his wife Hillary Clinton collapsed suddenly during a   tribute ceremony in New York City and was forced to summon her campaign van. Rose was skeptical, pointing out that the video appeared to be something more serious than dehydration. “Well if it is, it’s a mystery to me and all of her doctors,” Clinton said. “Rarely, but on more than one occasion over the last many, many years the same sort of thing has happened to her when she just got severely dehydrated. ” Clinton suggested that her fatigue was the result of her busy career and time spent on the trail, but suggested that his wife was merely “dizzy. ” “She’s worked like a demon as you know as Secretary of State and as a Senator and in the years since,” he said. “She had two and a half hard days before the day she got dizzy. ” He insisted that Hillary was doing much better after resting at home and would be back on the campaign trail sooner than expected. “She was even better last night before she went to sleep, she got a good night’s sleep,” Clinton said."

Lewandowski: Trump May Stage Townhall if Fox Won’t Dump Megyn - Breitbart,"From Gabriel Sherman in New York Magazine’s “Daily Intelligencer“:  With just five days until Fox News airs the final GOP debate before the Iowa Caucuses, Donald Trump is reigniting his war with Megyn Kelly. “Based on ‪@MegynKelly’s conflict of interest and bias she should not be allowed to be a moderator of the next debate,” Trump tweeted while campaigning in Iowa on Saturday. Trump’s feud with Kelly has been one of the most memorable storylines of this raucous GOP primary. In recent weeks, it has heated up. In a lengthy Vanity Fair profile this month, Kelly boasted of writing the now famous debate question about Trump’s history of misogynic comments, which ignited the feud this summer. And last week, Kelly sarcastically brought up Sarah Palin’s Trump endorsement, as well as hosted National Review editor Rich Lowry to promote the National Review’s   issue. Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, indicated that Trump could walk away from the debate if Fox won’t exclude Kelly. “Let’s see what happens,” he told me. “It’s fair to say Mr. Trump is a significant ratings driver for these debates. If we aren’t on stage for some reason, they wouldn’t have the record 24 million viewers and would be back with   million people. ” Read the rest of the article here."

Islamic State Demolishes Iconic ‘Clock Church’ in Mosul,"In their ongoing rampage against all things Christian, Islamic State jihadists have blown up the historic “Clock Church” in the center of Mosul, one of the most recognizable features of the city which could be seen from miles around. [The distinctive bell tower with the clock had been given to Iraqi Christians by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III. The church, historically known as the “Church of the Miraculous Madonna,” had been under the care of the Dominican Fathers until being devastated Monday morning with the use of explosives.  The Church was inaugurated on August 4, 1873, and the clock tower was added later when Empress Eugenie donated it in appreciation for efforts made by the Dominican Fathers during a typhoid epidemic that started in 1879. The clock tower was completed in 1882. Islamic State forces have been under pressure in Mosul, with Kurdish forces to the north and Iraqi government and Shia militia forces to the south threatening to retake it. Official sources of the Chaldean Patriarchate have attributed the sacrilegious act of vandalism to militants of the Islamic State that has controlled the city since June 9, 2014. According to local sources, the jihadists evacuated the area around the church and ransacked the building for whatever could be looted before detonating the explosive charges. The Chaldean Patriarchate strongly condemned this “targeting of the Christian Church,” which it called “a grave sin against God and man” undertaken to erase Iraq’s Christians memory in favor of a state of strangers who commit terror in the name of Islam. The Chaldean Patriarchate also asked men and women of good will to condemn the act, and urged the international community and religious authorities “to fully assume their responsibilities to protect the country and the lives of innocent citizens, to take serious steps to end the wars and conflicts and create the conditions for laying the foundations of just and comprehensive peace in Iraq. ” “The bells of that clock,” said Sister Luigina Sako, superior of the house in Rome of the Chaldean Sisters of the Daughters of Mary, “chimed in our youth, when Mosul was a city where you lived in peace. ” “I remember as a student, when we had an important exam,” Sr. Sako said, “we all went, Christians and Muslims, to take our requests for help to the Lourdes grotto of that church, which even our Muslim friends knew and honored as the Church of the Miraculous Madonna. ” Christians have lived in Mosul for almost 2, 000 years, and at one time Mosul was home to the largest population of Christians in the country outside of the nearby region of Iraqi Kurdistan.

"Myanmar warplane kills 5 in China, reports say"," (CNN) A Myanmar warplane fighting rebels dropped a bomb at a sugarcane field in China, the latter’s state media reported Saturday. The bomb killed five civilians.  In addition to the fatalities, eight others were wounded, according to Xinhua news agency.  Shortly after the incident Friday, China sent fighter jets to patrol over their shared border.   The jets are there to ”track, monitor, warn and chase away” Myanmar military planes, China’s air force told state media.  China summoned Myanmar’s ambassador in Beijing after the incident in the border city of Lincang.  Liu Zhenmin, the vice foreign minister for China, called on Myanmar to investigate and bring those behind the attack to justice.  Myanmar forces have been battling ethnic separatist rebels in the rugged border region across from Yunnan province in China’s southwest.   Recent clashes near the border have left dozens dead and stray gunfire has damaged property on the Chinese side of the border, prompting Beijing to warn Myanmar to ensure safety.  On Sunday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said that China would act to safeguard the stability of its border with Myanmar. In a statement published in the New Light of Myanmar newspaper, the Myanmar government expressed sorrow for the incident and vowed to investigate. "
Buttered Swordfish for Finicky Kids — With Plenty of Sauce for the Adults - The New York Times,"I cannot possibly count how many times I have been sought out by some mom with an urgent, hard, particular shine in her eye who wants to know, needs to know, how and what I feed my children. As I am in fact a woman, a restaurant chef and a parent of two, it’s an understandable mistake. Let me disappoint straight away: My priority has never been having kids who eat it is about having kids who sleep. Nobody wants to get home from a restaurant job at 1:30 in the morning, stir themselves a medicinal, soporific negroni, shower off the greasy stink of a commercial kitchen and finally hit the pillow around 3 a. m. only to hear the cracking thunder of her alert and chipper darlings at 6:30 a. m. I decided I could tolerate all the Cheddar Goldfish and the years of plain buttered pasta as long as they slept till 11 a. m. I was also a little jumpy about making the dinner table some weird proxy outlet for ego trips or power trips. Once, on a summer vacation to Corsica, my mother forced one of my brothers to stay at the dinner table until he finished his plate of oily, slick ratatouille  —   a texture that made him gag  —   and in the end, he not only never ate it, but the struggle went on for a full 48 hours, escalating to such heights that the boy went missing the next day, was not found by dark, was not found by midnight and was only returned by the local gendarmes the following evening. I was anxious for him, and also for her. She was not equipped to make five different dinners for five different kids at their varying stages of a developing palate, nor to tolerate it. And I knew a guy who would bring his    daughter to my restaurant all the time  —   dressed exclusively in black      and black leggings  —   and incessantly advertise his suffocating pride at the fact that she “loved” the monkfish liver at Prune and the sea urchin at, as I recall, Le Bernardin. I know I was supposed to be impressed, but it made me squirm. I prefer the family dinner table to be pretty pleasant for everyone at it, including the   and lonely parents who most often find themselves home solo  —   either by dint of divorce, single parenting or   (one parent stays late at work while the other is tasked with getting home in time to feed the little people)  —   and who find themselves with only 20 or so urgent minutes to get the job done, not to mention a stubborn kid who won’t eat, well, ratatouille, for example. If you find yourself in the bland, boring, beige phase, when different textures cannot butt up against another on the same plate, or one speck of parsley can contaminate the whole dinner, I encourage you to find all the white foods you can actually love  —   cauliflower, chicken, fish, rice, apples, bread, eggs, banana  —   and go at them with deft ambidexterity: a plain piece of swordfish for those who will run away from home otherwise, and a lively piquant pan sauce  —   in this case lemony, capery piccata  —   for those who will drink themselves to an early death if they don’t have something adult and interesting at the table to eat. In other words, sauce, but at all times, on the side. Unless we are discussing real food scarcity or a diagnosed medical condition, I wish I had encouraged all those moms who have cornered me over the years to fix themselves a small bowl of something acidic and buttery and lively and herbaceous and drop it on the dinner table and take it a little easier over the   and   phases of their otherwise perfectly healthy kids. My kids did not die from too many meals of plain buttered pasta, or plain buttered chicken, or plain buttered swordfish, or plain buttered cauliflower. And they were not harmed by mercury or pesticides or hidden   corn syrup because I always shopped right. They were not kids to brag about, necessarily, from a culinary perspective, nor were they easy to take to more ambitious friends’ houses or better restaurants for the longest time. I had to disappoint a lot of   mothers along the way who thought I had the magic answer. But we’ve lately rounded the corner, as one likes sushi and they both like ramen and broccoli and one asks for hot sauce and creamed spinach while the other has started craving the tart brightness of lemon juice  —   affording me an experience I thought I had forsaken long ago, that of hearing the   sound in the whole world: “Mama, I think this is the best swordfish you have ever made. ” Which is outranked only by the No. 1 greatest sound of all time: the           stretch of silence of my champion sleepers. Recipe: Swordfish Piccata"
"Bus plows into parade crowd in Haiti, killing 38"," (CNN) At least 38 people were killed and 13 others injured in northern Haiti after a bus plowed into a festival crowd before dawn Sunday, in what local authorities said was a hit and run incident. The bus, owned by the transportation company Blue Sky Logistics, was carrying people from the northern Haitian city of Cap Haitien to the nation’s capital, Port Au Prince. The bus encountered streets crowded with revelers celebrating Rara, a popular festive season in Haiti that stretches from Mardi Gras until Easter Sunday. Just outside the city of Gonaives, the bus struck two pedestrians, one of whom died instantly. The bus driver continued on for several miles before encountering a Rara band playing music in the middle of the road. The bus plowed through the first group of musicians, then drove through a second and a third band.  The driver fled the scene on foot and is still at large, police said. Authorities are actively searching for him.  According to one eyewitness, people were still trapped under the bus when it finally stopped. ”You could see bodies missing arms, bodies with stomachs out, and a trail of blood on the ground,” a man named Rigorov, who lives in the area, said. ”You could hear people crying and calling for help, but I could not make a difference on who is alive and who is not.” Angry survivors tried to set the bus on fire while passengers were still inside, police said, but officers intervened and prevented them from doing so."
GOP Rep Susan Brooks: Admin Spent Two Hours Discussing How To Go Into Benghazi ’Without Truly Offending Libya’ During Benghazi - Breitbart,"On Tuesday’s “MSNBC Live,” Representative Susan Brooks ( ) stated that the Benghazi Select Committee, which she served on, uncovered that “there was a White House secure video conference that took place, we did not know that previously. That Secretary Clinton participated in, and other White House officials  …    and they had discussions for over two hours about how to go in without truly offending Libya, how to send people to Tripoli, never to Benghazi. ”  Brooks said, “I, and members of the committee are very concerned as to why the secretary and the State Department didn’t follow recommendations that have made  —   been made by previous ARBs or Accountability Review Boards. First and foremost, the secretary of state, whether it was Secretary Clinton at the time or Secretary Kerry now, is responsible for security of their people. Security should be a top priority. And in fact, in 2010, when Secretary Clinton ordered a review of processes, there was a strong recommendation made that changes should be made about how the State Department handled security. That was rejected by Under Secretary Kennedy, and they went with the status quo, or what they call regular order. So things should have changed before this incident ever happened. And once Ambassador Stevens  …    went to Libya, he went with no military assistance. He went and requested multiple times, he and other diplomatic security, to have more agents, to have more physical security, and quite frankly, it was rejected by the State Department. ” She added, “[I]t was really unbelievable to us, that in fact the Defense Department, had no assets, moving toward Benghazi at the time that the annex was attacked. So almost eight hours after the initial attack on the mission compound, and after our brave men had moved to the annex, there were still no military assets moving directly to Benghazi. We also learned that there was a White House secure video conference that took place, we did not know that previously. That Secretary Clinton participated in, and other White House officials, although Secretary Panetta did not, the president did not, and they had discussions for over two hours about how to go in without truly offending Libya, how to send people to Tripoli, never to Benghazi. And so there were some significant, I think, deficiencies and mistakes made, and decisions that were made about how to go rescue our people. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"
There’s one new Tesla car that nobody is talking about,"’’ ’Tesla launched its Model X SUV last year and will reveal its forthcoming Model 3   vehicle next month.’ ”You can   a Model X right now, but the Model 3 isn’t expected to arrive until 2017.” ”These two Teslas are all anyone has been talking about lately  —   especially Wall Street analysts who want to figure out which way Tesla’s extremely volatile stock price is headed.” ’But Tesla is working on another car that nobody ever mentions.’ ’It’’s going to be such a fast and sexy car that CEO Elon Musk has reserved a special category of speed for it:  Like ”Ludicrous Mode”  —   Tesla’’s current   technology  —   the label is nicked from Mel Brooks’’ ”Star Wars” parody, ”Space Balls. ”’ ’Ludicrous Mode already enables Tesla’’s Model S P90D sedan to serve up the kind of acceleration we normally enjoy in Ferraris and Lamborghinis. It weakens the knees to imagine what ”Maximum Plaid” will feel like.’ ’And the car that Tesla has designated for its    mph crown is a blast from the past: the Roadster.’ ’Some Tesla observers suspected that the company was going to let its first car fade away. With a   chassis and an early version of Tesla’’s electric powertrain, the Roadster was a blistering little thing, capable of       runs  —   with the top down  —   in ”Sport” trim (a 2. 0 version of the original Roadster). ’ ”But Tesla isn’t going to let the Roadster go the way of the Dodo. In fact, before 2020, a new Roadster should hit the streets.” ”Even if you think Tesla should be all about building   electric vehicles for the everyman  —   and that its priority needs to be beating back challengers on that front  —   you have to admire the company’s dedication to its roots. ” ’You also have to appreciate that while Tesla is trending in the direction of boring with its master plans, it doesn’’t want to abandon sexy completely. The whole point of the original Roadster was to change hearts and minds about electric cars. They didn’’t have to be glorified golf carts; they could be hot and dazzling and    . The Roadster was astonishing when it hit the scene in the  . We don’’t see them as often as we used to, but when we do, they still turn heads. ”Wow! That’’s a Tesla! ”’ ”In many respects, Tesla has shown any new entrant to the auto space how it’s done. You have to grab the public by the lapels and shake.” ”Just look at Faraday Future, a mysterious new carmaker, and what it did at CES earlier this year. Faraday’s plans for world domination rest on developing a very flexible platform for EVs and connected cars. But what they pulled the cover off of in Las Vegas was a concept that looked ready to run the 24 Hours of Le Mans on the rings of Saturn.” ”For the past few months, plenty of worry has been expressed about Tesla’s prospects, as it struggles through some obvious growing pains. But the idea that Tesla will ultimately be selling at least four and probably more cars, with a overtly     at the pinnacle of the range, should be reassuring. This is what the world’s premier automakers, from Porsche to BMW to even General Motors (Corvette, anybody?) all do: build really compelling cars, at times versatile, at times dull, but also at times frivolous. And don’t forget, as much as Tesla is about   cars and vehicles than can be transformed via overnight software releases, the company’s DNA has wound into it more than a fair amount of    . I’ve driven the Roadster, and I’m here to tell you, although it may have been the car of the future at one time, it was also damned thrilling to pilot on a sunny day in Southern California.” ’The Roadster was the Tesla that started it all.

He later appeared headed to a loss in Idaho.’ ’Trump started off his speech by indicating his interest in boosting   candidates this November.’ ’”It’’s very, very important as a Republican that our senators and that our congressmen get reelected and that we get a good group of people together, that we keep the people that are there,” Trump said. ”We have some terrific people. Not all of them are on my side, but we have some terrific people. ”’ ’He then touted the turnout at the polls and his crossover appeal. This was a potential message to Washington Republicans, who have long worried that a Trump nomination could hurt their chances of holding on to the Senate.’ ’”We have Democrats coming over, we have independents coming over, and they haven’’t done that ever, probably ever,” Trump said. ”And with all these people coming over we’’re going to have something very, very special. ”’ ’’ ’Trump also assured people that he could beat Clinton in a general election.’ ’”If I get to go against Hillary, polls are showing that I beat her, and some of the polls have my beating her very easily,” Trump said. ”We will take many, many people away from the Democrats and we’’ll take many people away that normally go Democrat as independents. ”’ ’In a sharp pivot, Trump further sounded conciliatory toward Ryan. Just seven days ago, at another postelection press conference, Trump had warned that Ryan  toward him or ”pay a big price. ”’ ’”I want to thank Paul Ryan,” the frontrunner said on Tuesday. ”He called me a couple of days ago. He could not have been nicer. He was very encouraging, and I have great respect for Paul Ryan. ”’ ’When Romney came up as a   topic, Trump shrugged off Romney’’s furious attacks against his campaign.

"Hitachi Unveils Robot That Can Understand Four Languages, Communicate Remotely with Other Bots - Breitbart","Hitachi has introduced EMIEW3, a robot with “remote brain” technology designed to function in real world environments and situations, such as retail stores, public facilities, and tourist areas. [The autobot is the third version of the EMIEW  —   or Excellent Mobility and Interactive Existance as Workmate  —   and the first “commercially viable” member of a series of robots originally unveiled by the Japanese conglomerate in 2005. There is little cosmetic difference between the latest iteration and its predecessors besides the addition of its LED beating heart under the surface of its chest the majority of the upgrades are found under its familiar red and white shell.  Built as an active customer service assistant, EMIEW3’s software utilizes   cameras and understanding of human movement patterns to detect and autonomously engage with those who seem to need assistance. Upon connecting with the customer, EMIEW3 employs   analysis to accurately recognize and translate voices  —   four languages so far  —   even in the midst of noisy environments. Capable of navigating minor obstacles at nearly 4mph and avoiding objects in its blindspots, the 33 pound humanoid robot can successfully keep up with its human counterparts, even uprighting its   tall frame if toppled over. Through a   connection, robots in various locations can communicate with one another while being monitored from a remote location. While the price of the robot has not yet been decided, Hitachi spokeswoman stated that the EMIEW3 “will be on sale for business use and not for consumers. ” With a public launch tentatively planned for 2018, Japanese citizens can expect to reap the benefits of EMIEW3 quite soon. According to Nikkei Asian Review staff writers Tomohisa Takei and Satoshi Morotomi, “In just a few years [EMIEW3] will provide customer service in airports, hospitals, train stations and other facilities, speaking four languages so that it can even serve the masses of foreign tourists streaming into Japan. ” Hitachi has said that once EMIEW3 is on the market, they hope to expand its market beyond Japan."
Man arrested in connection with fire at Orlando gunman’s mosque," (CNN) A Florida man was arrested Wednesday in connection with a reported arson at a Fort Pierce mosque where Orlando gunman Omar Mateen attended, Maj. Dave Thompson of the St. Lucie County Sheriff’s Office said. Joseph Michael Schreiber, 32, will be charged with arson, and a   enhancement will be added to the charge, meaning it will be classified as a   felony. As a person who was imprisoned for a felony previously, Schreiber could face a sentence of 30 years, if convicted. But he also could face up to life in prison as a habitual offender, authorities said Wednesday. Schreiber was still being questioned by investigators, Thompson said.  ”An examination of his social media account shows multiple   points and comments,” Thompson said.  The major said tips from callers and surveillance video led to the arrest. The fire broke out late Sunday at the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce. Mateen, who killed 49 people at the Orlando nightclub in June, had attended the mosque. No one was inside when the fire started, authorities said. St. Lucie County responded to the blaze around 12:31 a. m. after two drivers called 911 to report flames on the building’s roof. A man riding a    motorcycle, possibly with saddlebags, was seen driving away. Mateen had attended the Fort Pierce Islamic Center since 2003, Imam Syed Shafeeq Rahman told CNN earlier this year. Mateen had usually come for Friday prayers before the rampage at the Orlando nightclub on June 12. Rahman said the mosque preached a peaceful message. ”So far as we here in Fort Pierce are concerned, we are always very conscious    consciously speaking about peace, about love, about unity,” Rahman told CNN in a previous interview. ”We came to this country this country gave us everything.” The mosque had also been attended by Moner Mohammad   a Florida man who became the first known American suicide bomber in Syria. One of the mosque’s attendees told CNN that the Fort Pierce Islamic Center was ”like any other mosque.” ”It’s simple, friendly,” Bedar Bakht said in June. ”Our imam is very good at explaining things. We never hear any stupid things coming out from anybody. It’s very  .”"

I’m A Gay Man And Mass Muslim Immigration Terrifies Me,"I’d hate to be thrown off a roof. I mean, imagine if I landed on this face. But that’s the future Europe and even the US are sleepwalking into if we let wacky progressive   keep apologising for radical Islam and calling the rest of us racist for expressing our concern at mass immigration from cultures that care nothing for the rights of women and gays. [You want to see a “patriarchy”? Fly to Riyadh or Tehran. In the former, women can’t drive. (Alright, fair enough, they might be on to something there.) In the latter, gays are hanged, often from cranes in public places. ISIS is even more brutal, hurling fags off the roof after ritually humiliating them. In Raqqa you’ll see women and children sold for a few hundred dollars.  These are the attitudes we’re importing by allowing millions of Muslims to settle in western Europe. Sorry if that sounds intolerant, but remember women and gays aren’t just treated like shit by ISIS, but mainstream Muslim culture, too. I can’t remember how many Muslim countries have the death penalty for homosexuality. What is it, ten? Eleven? We now know that at least one of the Paris terrorists came into Europe posing as a “refugee. ” This confirms all the worst fears of progressive commentators who were hoping the political Right was wrong about the security threat mass immigration presented. But there’s a more general concern for liberal western democracies: it’s not just the jihadis, but the attitudes of ordinary Muslims that are a grave cause for concern, not just for the women being   in Malmö but homosexuals everywhere in Europe. So you can accuse me of being “islamophobic” if you want, because no, I don’t want to be shouted at or spat on in the street. Maybe my gayness is standing in the way of a Muslim utopia  …     but I’m going to be selfish here and say maybe we don’t import all the people who want to murder me. I’m serious. Gay people are getting stoned to death all the time in the Middle East, and not in the fun way: in the          way. I don’t mean to be callous, but what are we gaining by letting these people in? Why can’t we help them with overseas aid? Why do they need to come here? Aren’t we just encouraging more of them to risk the trip by throwing our borders open? Put like that, I hope you can appreciate why I’m considering a move to the US and just what you’re giving up by transforming your societies and turning a blind eye to sharia courts where a woman’s testimony is, legally, worth less than a man’s. You don’t hear progressives complaining about that sort of thing, of course, because somehow crybully Muslims occupy an even more prestigious position on the Oppression League Tables than women and homos. Why are   so ferociously   from these fucking awful countries? I really don’t get it. Of course, I realise there are some other options available to me. I could always take the veil. Terrorists pretend to be women by wearing it, so why can’t I pretend to be one too, to avoid being   in Bradford? Plus, I wouldn’t get hit on by Pakistani rape gangs because as we all know they prefer helpless young white girls to their own beefy, hirsute womenfolk. But when I think about it, British weather can be awfully muggy, and those things really don’t look very comfy. And how am I supposed to cruise handsome dads in the park wearing a black bedsheet? From what I can tell, it’s not women and children coming over in these “refugee crises” but strong    men. Under ordinary circumstances I’d be fine with a bit of Middle Eastern rough, but I prefer my nocturnal encounters with   men to be at least partially consensual. The Left’s wilful, suicidal ignorance about Muslim culture is at odds with virtually every one of their cherished social justice prescriptions. They look for sexism in “mansplaining” and flirtatious remarks, yet turn a blind eye to a culture where the only acceptable role for women is   housewife. They see intolerance in Halloween costumes, yet ignore the regular atrocities of cultures that   each other over regional, tribal, and sectarian differences. They think conservatives who disagree with their definition of gay marriage to be bigots worthy of social ostracism, yet welcome into their midst a culture that wants to execute queers like me. If you don’t believe me, just look at what’s happening in Sweden. A gay pride march that planned to go via a Muslim area was criticised and called “needlessly provocative” by progressives who care more about protecting an immigrant’s right to be a hateful bigot than the rights of gay citizens to express their sexual identity. What am I missing here? I know this is the point at which I’m supposed to say not all Muslims in the west are bad people, but I can’t bring myself to care about caveats when 1, 200 girls are getting raped in Rotherham and Britain is sending more fighters to ISIS than almost any other country. As the journalist and activist Brigitte Gabriel points out, the peaceful majority are irrelevant. Liberals refuse to face the fact that Muslim immigrants will never adapt to western cultures and become typical Britons without some kind of massive   and assimilation. They expect us to expand our progressive worldview by accepting Islam’s   barbarism. The problem with accepting all of these people, and their culture, is there’s no place for me in it. You get to have your ISIS friends, or you get to have Milo, because when you invite us to the same party  …     off the roof I go. Perhaps this is the Left’s plan all along. Banning me from campuses hasn’t dented my popularity, so perhaps murder is the only way the Left can get rid of me. I would take it as a compliment, but even I’m not egotistical enough to want western civilisation to be destroyed on my account.

"Former Vikings, Cardinals Coach Dennis Green Dies at 67 - Breitbart","Dennis Green, a familiar face on NFL sidelines, died after a heart attack on Thursday. [“Dennis passed away last night from complications of cardiac arrest,” the former football coach’s family informed in a Friday statement. “His family was by his side and he fought hard. ”  Green posted a   record as head coach for the Minnesota Vikings and Arizona Cardinals over 13 NFL seasons. He took the Vikings to the postseason eight times over ten seasons. He registered just one losing season in Minnesota. But he fared poorly in the playoffs, going   and falling to a pedestrian Atlanta Falcons team in the NFC Championship Game after leading the Vikings to a   record and numerous NFL offensive records during the 1998 season. The Vikings also lost an NFC Championship Game to the New York Giants under Green after the 2000 season. The Vikings released this statement: We are incredibly saddened by the sudden passing of former Vikings Head Coach Dennis Green. Denny made his mark in ways far beyond being an outstanding football coach. He mentored countless players and served as a father figure for the men he coached. Denny founded the Vikings Community Tuesday Program, a critical initiative that is now implemented across the entire NFL. He took great pride in helping assistant coaches advance their careers. His tenure as one of the first African American head coaches in both college and the NFL was also transformative. Our thoughts and prayers are with the entire Green family. A disciple of Bill Walsh, Green coached at Stanford, Northwestern, and the Sacramento Mountain Lions of the United Football League. He instilled the motto “Plan Your Work and Work Your Plan” into his players. But fans remember him for another catchphrase. “The Bears are who we thought they were,” Green angrily said after his Cardinals blew a   lead on Monday Night Football in 2006. “That’s why we took the damn field. If you want to crown them, then crown their ass. But they are who we thought they were. And we let them off the hook. ” Green died at 67. But he, or at least a more fiery version of the normally   man, lives forever on YouTube."
14-Year-Old Girl Cryogenically Frozen Following Legal Battle Prior to Her Death - Breitbart,"A    British girl with cancer won a legal battle shortly before her death, being granted the ability to cryogenically preserve her body in case of a cure in the future. [“I have been asked to explain why I want this unusual thing done,” wrote the girl in a letter to Justice Peter Jackson, shortly before her death in October. “I am only 14 years old and I don’t want to die but I know I am going to die. ”  “I think being cryopreserved gives me a chance to be cured and woken up  —   even in hundreds of years’ time,” she continued. “I don’t want to be buried underground. I want to live and live longer and I think that in the future they may find a cure for my cancer and wake me up. ” “I want to have this chance,” the girl concluded. “This is my wish. ” Jackson, who cited “the valiant way in which she was facing her predicament” took just under a week and a half to come to a conclusion on the case, and the girl’s family were permitted to spend around £37, 000 on the procedure for “infinite” preservation. Though the girl’s mother supported her wishes, her father was reportedly against the decision. “Even if the treatment is successful and she is brought back to life in let’s say 200 years, she may not find any relative and she might not remember things and she may be left in a desperate situation given that she is only 14 years old and will be in the United States of America,” said the father, before he eventually accepted the decision. Her father, who is divorced from her mother, had not seen the girl in six years before she became ill, and he was denied the ability to see her body after death. “It was a difficult process. Some might say the girl’s mother’s attention was directed towards that procedure rather than grieving at this time,” said the girl’s lawyer, Zoe Fleetwood, before adding that it was a “great privilege” to work on the case and that the girl called the judge “Mr Hero Peter Jackson. ” Citing the unfamiliarity of hospital staff in dealing with the body, Jackson expressed support for a “proper regulation” of the procedure in the future.

"Trump Champions Globalism’s ‘Ignored, Neglected and Abandoned’: ‘I Am Your Voice’ - Breitbart","In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night, GOP nominee Donald Trump championed Americans who have been “ignored, neglected and abandoned” by globalist trade and immigration policies. [“A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation’s most powerful special interests,” he said. “That’s because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit. Believe me  —   it’s for their benefit. ”  Trump continued: Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place. They are throwing money at her because they have total control over every single thing she does. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings. That is why Hillary Clinton’s message is that things will never change  —   never ever. My message is that things have to change  —   and they have to change right now. [Applause] Every day I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation that have been ignored, neglected and abandoned. I have visited the   factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country. And they are forgotten, but they’re not going to be forgotten long. These are people who work hard but no longer have a voice. I am your voice. [Applause] I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good. I have no patience for injustice —   [Audience chants “USA!” as a protester interrupts the speech and is escorted out by security.] How great are our police? And how great is Cleveland? [Applause] Thank you. I have no patience for injustice. No tolerance for government incompetence, of which there is so much. No sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens. When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws  —   or still worse, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash  —   I am not able to look the other way, and I won’t look the other way."
Shia LaBeouf Is Arrested at Anti-Trump Art Show in New York - The New York Times,"The actor and performance artist Shia LaBeouf was arrested early Thursday morning on misdemeanor assault and harassment charges while protesting President Trump at a livestream art installation in Queens. In videos online, Mr. LaBeouf  —   who has a history of provocative behavior and a record of arrests for minor offenses  —   expresses outrage, evidently aimed at Mr. Trump, and uses   language to ask how the public can make it normal “to be a Nazi out here. ” In one video, a small gathering of fellow protesters chants “He will not divide us” as the bearded Mr. LaBeouf speaks. A police officer approaches, and Mr. LaBeouf appears to get into a verbal altercation with him before the officer places him in handcuffs and escorts him out of the camera’s view. Mr. LaBeouf was arrested just after 12. 30 a. m. and charged with misdemeanor assault and with harassment, according to Detective Adam Navarro of the New York City Police Department. He was issued a desk appearance ticket and instructed to come to court on April 4. He was not jailed. Detective Navarro said that the police were called after Mr. LaBeouf got into an argument with another man at the installation, pulled off the man’s scarf and, in the process, scratched his face. The man did not need to be hospitalized, the detective said. The livestream is part of Mr. LaBeouf’s latest art project, “He Will Not Divide Us,” a collaboration with the artists Nastja Sade Ronkko and Luke Turner. On Inauguration Day, the actor placed a camera outside the Museum of the Moving Image, in Astoria, Queens, and invited members of the public to repeat the words “he will not divide us” into the camera. The aim is to keep streaming images of people repeating the words,   throughout Mr. Trump’s time in office. Representatives for Mr. LaBeouf did not immediately reply to requests for comment on Thursday morning. The arrest is not Mr. LaBeouf’s first   with the law: In 2014, while at a Broadway performance of the musical “Cabaret,” he was arrested and later charged with disorderly conduct and criminal trespass. The actor first rose to prominence as a child performer on the Disney Channel television series “Even Stevens,” and in 2008 starred in Steven Spielberg’s “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. ” More recently, he has drawn as much attention for his unusual art projects as for his acting. In November 2015, Mr. LaBeouf arranged a   marathon of all of his movies at the Angelika Film Center in Manhattan. The next month, he set up shop in an art gallery in Liverpool, England, asking people to call him and “touch his soul. ”"
"With False Claims, Trump Attacks Media on Turnout and Intelligence Rift - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   President Trump used his first full day in office on Saturday to unleash a remarkably bitter attack on the news media, falsely accusing journalists of both inventing a rift between him and intelligence agencies and deliberately understating the size of his inauguration crowd. In a visit to the Central Intelligence Agency intended to showcase his support for the intelligence community, Mr. Trump ignored his own repeated public statements criticizing the intelligence community, a group he compared to Nazis just over a week ago. He also called journalists “among the most dishonest human beings on earth,” and he said that up to 1. 5 million people had attended his inauguration, a claim that photographs disproved. Later, at the White House, he dispatched Sean Spicer, the press secretary, to the briefing room in the West Wing, where Mr. Spicer scolded reporters and made a series of false statements. He said news organizations had deliberately misstated the size of the crowd at Mr. Trump’s inauguration on Friday in an attempt to sow divisions at a time when Mr. Trump was trying to unify the country, warning that the new administration would hold them to account. The statements from the new president and his spokesman came as hundreds of thousands of people protested against Mr. Trump, a crowd that appeared to dwarf the one that gathered the day before when he was sworn in. It was a striking display of invective and grievance at the dawn of a presidency, usually a time when the White House works to set a tone of national unity and to build confidence in a new leader. Instead, the president and his team appeared embattled and defensive, signaling that the pugnacious style Mr. Trump employed as a candidate will persist now that he has ascended to the nation’s highest office. Saturday was supposed to be a day for Mr. Trump to mend fences with the intelligence community, with an appearance at the C. I. A. ’s headquarters in Langley, Va. While he was lavish in his praise, the president focused in his   speech on his complaints about news coverage of his criticism of the nation’s spy agencies, and meandered to other topics, including the crowd size at his inauguration, his level of political support, his mental age and his intellectual heft. “I just want to let you know, I am so behind you,” Mr. Trump told more than 300 employees assembled in the lobby for his remarks. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has questioned the intelligence agencies’ conclusion that Russia meddled in the United States election on his behalf. After the disclosure of a dossier with unsubstantiated claims about Mr. Trump, he accused the intelligence community of allowing the leak and wrote on Twitter, “Are we living in Nazi Germany?” On Saturday, he said journalists were responsible for any suggestion that he was not fully supportive of intelligence agencies’ work. “I have a running war with the media,” Mr. Trump said. “They are among the most dishonest human beings on earth, and they sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community. ” “The reason you’re the No. 1 stop is, it is exactly the opposite,” Mr. Trump added. “I love you, I respect you, there’s nobody I respect more. ” Mr. Trump also took issue with news reports about the number of people who attended his inauguration, complaining that the news media used photographs of “an empty field” to make it seem as if his inauguration did not draw many people. “We caught them in a beauty,” Mr. Trump said of the news media, “and I think they’re going to pay a big price. ” Mr. Spicer said that Mr. Trump had drawn “the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration,” a statement that photographs clearly show to be false. Mr. Spicer said photographs of the inaugural ceremonies were deliberately framed “to minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the National Mall,” although he provided no proof of either assertion. Photographs of Barack Obama’s inauguration in 2009 and of Mr. Trump’s plainly showed that the crowd on Friday was significantly smaller, but Mr. Spicer attributed that disparity to new white ground coverings he said had caused empty areas to stand out and to security measures that had blocked people from entering the Mall. “These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong,” Mr. Spicer said. He also admonished a journalist for erroneously reporting on Friday that Mr. Trump had removed a bust of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office, calling the mistake  —   which was corrected quickly  —   “egregious. ” And he incorrectly claimed that ridership on Washington’s subway system was higher than on Inauguration Day in 2013. In reality, there were 782, 000 riders that year, compared with 571, 000 riders this year, according to figures from the   transit authority. Mr. Spicer also said that security measures had been extended farther down the National Mall this year, preventing “hundreds of thousands of people” from viewing the ceremony. But the Secret Service said the measures were largely unchanged this year, and there were few reports of long lines or delays. Commentary about the size of his inauguration crowd made Mr. Trump increasingly angry on Friday, according to several people familiar with his thinking. On Saturday, Mr. Trump told his advisers that he wanted to push back hard on “dishonest media” coverage  —   mostly referring to a Twitter post from a New York Times reporter showing    frames of Mr. Trump’s crowd and Mr. Obama’s in 2009. But most of Mr. Trump’s advisers urged him to focus on the responsibilities of his office during his first full day as president. However, in his remarks at the C. I. A. he wandered off topic several times, at various points telling the crowd he felt no older than 39 (he is 70) reassuring anyone who questioned his intelligence by saying, “I’m, like, a smart person” and musing out loud about how many intelligence workers backed his candidacy. “Probably almost everybody in this room voted for me, but I will not ask you to raise your hands if you did,” Mr. Trump said. “We’re all on the same wavelength, folks. ” But most of his remarks were devoted to attacking the news media. And Mr. Spicer picked up the theme later in the day in the White House briefing room. But his appearance, according to the people familiar with Mr. Trump’s thinking, went too far, in the president’s opinion. Mr. Trump’s appearance at the C. I. A. touched off a fierce reaction from some current and former intelligence officials. Nick Shapiro, who served as chief of staff to John O. Brennan, who resigned Friday as the C. I. A. director, said Mr. Brennan “is deeply saddened and angered at Donald Trump’s despicable display of   in front of C. I. A. ’s Memorial Wall of Agency heroes. “Brennan says that Trump should be ashamed of himself,” Mr. Shapiro added. “I was heartened that the president gave a speech at C. I. A. ,” said Michael V. Hayden, a former director of the C. I. A. and the National Security Agency. “It would have been even better if more of it had been about C. I. A. ” Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said that he had had high hopes for Mr. Trump’s visit as a step to begin healing the relationship between the president and the intelligence community, but that Mr. Trump’s meandering speech had dashed them. “While standing in front of the stars representing C. I. A. personnel who lost their lives in the service of their country  —   hallowed ground  —   Trump gave little more than a perfunctory acknowledgment of their service and sacrifice,” Mr. Schiff said. “He will need to do more than use the agency memorial as a backdrop if he wants to earn the respect of the men and women who provide the best intelligence in the world. ” Mr. Trump said nothing during the visit about how he had mocked the C. I. A. and other intelligence agencies as “the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. ” He did not mention his apparent willingness to believe Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, who is widely detested at the C. I. A. over his own intelligence agencies. He also did not say whether he would start receiving the daily intelligence briefs that are prepared for the president. The agency sees the president as its main audience, and his dismissal of the need for daily briefings from the intelligence community has raised concerns about morale among people who believe their work will not be respected at the White House. Since the election, hopes at the C. I. A. that the new administration would bring an infusion of energy and ideas have given way to trepidation about what Mr. Trump and his loyalists have planned. But the nomination of Mike Pompeo, a former Army infantry officer who is well versed in issues facing the intelligence community, to lead the C. I. A. has been received positively at the agency. “He has left the strong impression that he doesn’t trust the intelligence community and that he doesn’t have tremendous regard for their work,” Mark M. Lowenthal, a retired C. I. A. analyst, said of Mr. Trump. “The obvious thing to do is to counter that by saying, ‘I value you. I look forward to working with you. ’” “He called them Nazis,” Mr. Lowenthal added, referring to Mr. Trump’s characterization of the intelligence community. Mr. Lowenthal said Saturday’s visit should have been “a stroking expedition. ”"
No Americans Need Apply: U.S. Government Twice as Open to Foreign Business as Five Top Trading Partners Put Together,"America’s trading partners have walls keeping out U. S. businesses, while the U. S. government has an open door for foreign businesses. [American businesses can run up against these walls when trying to sell goods and services to foreign governments, which often prevent businesses from outside their own countries from taking part in government contracts, according to a new report from the Government Accountability Office.  By contrast, the U. S. government is far more open to allowing foreign businesses to receive government contracts, the GAO report said. The U. S. government has opened about $837 billion in procurement contracts to foreign competition, more than twice the $381 billion reported by the next five largest signatories to a World Trade Organization agreement intended to open government contracts to foreign bidders. Those are the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Norway and Canada. The size of the imbalance is even more remarkable because the total government procurement of those five is 32% larger than that of the U. S. according to the report. Government procurement is a major market for international business, amounting to $4. 4 trillion annually. The U. S. participates with 57 other countries in trade agreements that allow foreign firms to compete for government business. The agreements are supposed to ensure fair and open competition on a reciprocal basis —  but in practice have resulted in a strikingly unbalanced arrangement in which the U. S. government is far more open to doing business with foreign companies than foreign government are willing to do business with U. S. companies. The GAO undertook the study at the request of the Office of the U. S. Trade Representative, which monitors U. S. trade under the WTO. Officials from the U. S. T. R. say that “government procurement markets are often closed to foreign competition,” according to the report. The report also noted that flaws in the statistical reporting practices of governments make comparisons difficult and limit transparency —  even though both are goals of many trade agreements. The U. S. government’s practices, for instance, create a   delay in reporting U. S. government procurement, which means the data in the GAO report is six years old."
Tensions erupt in Senate after chaotic day on Trump nominees,"Washington (CNN) Tensions erupted in the Senate Tuesday as Democrats stalled several of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks, frustrating Republicans who accused Democrats of playing politics to try to hurt Trump and make Senate Republicans look ineffective.  Party leaders squared off after a   and chaotic morning when Democrats on one committee abruptly boycotted a hearing where two top administration officials were expected to clear votes to advance to the floor. In another committee, Democrats forced a delay in voting the nominee for attorney general, admitting it was in retaliation for Trump’s controversial executive orders this week on immigration. Votes on the floor even appeared to get personal when Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer voted against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s wife to be transportation secretary.  Republicans fumed. ”None of this is going to lead to a different outcome. The Cabinet appointments are going to be approved. I think they look quite foolish,” said McConnell,   about the Democrats. ”They are manufacturing issues on a daily basis to drag this process out.” Dems delay committee vote on Sessions, ”Our Republican colleagues are trying to rush these through. You know,    doesn’t mean ram the nominees through,” said Schumer,   York. ”These nominees are not what Donald Trump promised and not what represents American   values. They are billionaires. They are bankers. They are laden with conflict of interest. Many of them have had very extreme views.” The heightened emotions were on full display just hours before Trump was to name a Supreme Court nominee to fill the   seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia.   The appointment could trigger a massive battle between the parties made rawer for Democrats because of the refusal of Republicans to confirm Judge Merrick Garland for the opening last year.    Democrats even rejected an invitation to the White House to hear Trump make his   announcement in the East Room. ”I don’t want to be a prop in this. I want to take this seriously,” said Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, who indicated he was wary of the showmanship nature of the event.  Tempers flared early Monday after Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee abruptly refused to enter a hearing room and allow votes to take place for treasury secretary nominee Steve Mnuchin and health and human services secretary nominee Rep. Tom Price,  .  ”They are idiots,” Sen. Orrin Hatch,   the normally   committee chairman said bluntly about the Democrats. ”Anybody who would do something like that, it’s a complete breach of rule, a complete breach of decorum, a complete breach of just getting along around here.” Treasury secretary nominee’s foreign money links bring new scrutiny, But Democrats were equally upset by what they called misleading responses from Price about stock trades he made and from Mnuchin about foreclosures at a California bank he ran.  ”This morning, the finance committee was scheduled to vote on two nominees who have misled the public and held back important information about their backgrounds. Until questions are answered, Democrats believe the committee should not move forward with either nomination,” said Sen. Ron Wyden or Oregon, the committee’s top Democrat.  The surprise decision to boycott the votes    which prompted one GOP senator, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, to suggest the    should round up the missing senators    came at the same hour that that members of the Senate Judiciary Committee squared off over Sen. Jeff Sessions,   to be attorney general. A votes on Sessions was expected but Democrats employed a   procedural tool to block the committee from meeting for more than two hours after the Senate came into session. The move infuriated Republicans who had already pushed back a vote on Sessions for a week at the insistence of Democrats.  A committee vote is now likely Wednesday. On the floor, Democrats are dragging out a final vote on Rex Tillerson to be secretary of state even though he easily cleared a procedural hurdle Monday and is headed toward confirmation. Since Democrats are insisting all available debate time is used, they are forcing Republicans to keep the Senate open late night this week so a final vote can occur Wednesday, according to GOP aides. Some of Trump’s picks did advance Tuesday. Education nominee Betsy DeVos was cleared by the Senate education committee, despite a move by Democrats to invalidate the vote after it happened. Energy nominee Rick Perry and Interior Department pick Ryan ZInke were voted out of the energy committee.  On the floor, Elaine Chao, McConnell’s wife, was overwhelmingly confirmed to run the Transportation Department. But contributing to the lack of comity between the parties, Schumer was one of six Democrats to vote against the GOP leader’s spouse.   The move rankled some Republicans and raised questions about the ability of Schumer and McConnell to get along. An aide to McConnell told CNN that the GOP leader was surprised and not happy by this ”shot across the bow.” Schumer said he voted against Chao because she hadn’t publicly stated her position on Trump’s controversial immigration executive order issued this week, tying the fight over the confirmations to the latest flashpoint coming out of the White House.  ”She has not, so I voted against her, and I will vote against every nominee who does not,” Schumer said.  Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, described Schumer as typically a pragmatist on nominations but said he was being pulled to the left by the ”Bernie   Warren faction of the party.” Sen. John McCain,   had another explanation. He said Democrats are blocking nominations because they have a ”mob mentality” now because they are frustrated and filled with emotion, similar to the way Republicans were when they shut down the government over Obamacare."
Freedom Caucus Intrigued at Healthcare Offer After Meeting Pence,"Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows met with the Vice President late Monday after which he told reporters the caucus was “intrigued” at an offer to give states an option to waive two provisions of Obamacare. [Meadows established that the White House had not offered legislative text for a deal, but expects text within 24 hours. CNN reported that Meadows told reporters the provisions involved were the “essential health benefits” mandate, which dictates what insurers must cover, and a community health ratings requirement on insurers which prohibits charging higher premiums based on health status.  Conservatives have lobbied to have the two Obamacare provisions strike from the House Leadership’s Obamacare replacement plan, the American Health Care Act (AHCA). The potential new deal appears to be an alternative option that would allow states to opt out. There is no final deal and no Freedom Caucus members have changed their positions on AHCA, was the message from Meadows. “There is no deal in principle there is a solid idea that was offered,” he said according to the Hill. Lawmakers indicated the White House may be looking for a vote later this week, but Meadows warned of voting too soon and without time to allow the Congressional Budget Office to offer   analysis. He did offer that they are encouraged by the progress that appears to be happening. Some members of the moderate Tuesday Group, which could also stall passage of the AHCA, met with Pence earlier in the day at the White House according to the report. Over the weekend Sen. Rand Paul, who has opposed the AHCA, met and golfed with the President in Virginia. Paul took a brief moment to tell reporters that he was “very optimistic” about progress on repealing Obamacare.

Poll: Donald Trump Takes Lead in Florida - Breitbart,"Donald Trump is holding a narrow lead over Hillary Clinton in Florida, according to the latest Florida Atlantic University poll. [According to the survey results, Trump earns 43 percent to Clinton’s 41 percent. The two point lead falls within the 2. 7 percent margin of error.  Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson received eight percent in the poll. It’s the first poll, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average, with Trump leading Clinton in Florida since early July. Both Clinton and Trump have high negative numbers in Florida.   percent of voters said they had an unfavorable view of the New Yorker, while 58 percent hold a negative view of the former secretary of state. “The race between Clinton and Trump among Hispanics in Florida is closer than it is nationally,” the director of Florida Atlantic University’s Business and Economics Polling Initiative Monica Escaleras explained. “Some of that is probably the Cuban vote. Trump’s support among Latinos in Florida is helping him stay competitive. ” Although Trump’s numbers with minorities are better in Florida than nationally, he is still lagging behind Clinton by 10 points with Hispanics and by 50 points with African American and female voters. But with Independents, Trump is leading by   47 percent to 26 percent. The poll questioned 1, 200 likely voters on Aug. 19 to Aug. 22 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2. 7 percent."

World’s first AI electric racer showcases driverless car future ,"Hong Kong (CNN) With its   looks and Formula   velocity, this prototype ticks all the ”supercar” boxes    but this is no ordinary speed machine.  The ”DevBot” is an autonomous electric racing car    the first of its kind anywhere in the world, so say its developers, designed to reach speeds of 215 mph (350 kph) without anyone at the steering wheel.  A scary thought you might think, but not so say Roborace    the team of engineers and computer scientists behind it     who believe it will put people more at ease with the idea of driverless cars.  ”It’s been created to show the capabilities and make people feel a bit more comfortable about autonomous cars    so we need to show that by doing some cool stuff,” Roborace’s head of PR Victoria Tomlinson told CNN. The plan is eventually to have 10 autonomous cars all competing around a track in a Roborace series and performing stunts as part of Formula E race weekends.   MORE: ’Magnum’ Ferrari goes electric, ’Playing chicken’ ”It’s more of an entertainment series to display the capabilities of driverless,” Tomlinson says. ”So we’d like almost to play chicken with them    two cars coming towards each other and stopping on a certain point (before they hit each other) having them crisscross, doing figures of eight.”  However, things didn’t quite go to plan for its first scheduled street track outing at the inaugural Formula E Hong Kong ePrix earlier this month. There were no   figures of eight, only seven engineers struggling to push the 1.  car through a   turn outside its temporary home in Hong Kong    problems recharging the battery the reason given for the no show.

A Cry From the Heart: Michael Eric Dyson Addresses Race Head-On - The New York Times,"TEARS WE CANNOT STOPA Sermon to White AmericaBy Michael Eric Dyson228 pp. St. Martin’s Press. $24. 99. One Sunday in 1984, my father did something unexpected, at least for a white man in Georgia. He drove us past the little rural church we usually attended and kept going 40 miles south, all the way to Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist  —   home parish of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and an epicenter of the American civil rights movement. Reading Michael Eric Dyson’s “Tears We Cannot Stop: A Sermon to White America,” I was often reminded of that morning, when I was first exposed to the righteous anger, wry humor and unflinching honesty of a black pastor, determined to guide and teach his flock. While Dyson is best known as a writer and sociologist, he is also an ordained Baptist minister, and his new book draws both its impassioned style and its moral urgency from his years in the pulpit. At a time when one video after another has forced us to acknowledge that unarmed   are regularly killed by the police, Dyson desperately wants his readers to confront the sources of that violence in our nation’s longstanding culture of white supremacy. But he also knows how many political arguments and sociological studies have fallen on deaf ears. And so rather than a treatise, “Tears We Cannot Stop” is a fiery sermon, and an unabashedly emotional, personal appeal. “What I need to say” to white America, Dyson writes, can only be said in “a plea, a cry, a sermon, from my heart to yours. ” The result is one of the most frank and searing discussions of race I have ever read. This is a book that will anger some readers, especially those who reject Dyson’s central premise: that if we want true racial equality in America, whites themselves must destroy the enduring myths of white supremacy. Even sympathetic readers might mistake this extraordinary work for merely a catalog of white sins. But such a reading fails to account for the actual experience of Dyson’s sermon, in which a black preacher speaks to his white congregants in the most tender, intimate terms, even as he preaches against a culture of “whiteness” that “grows more shameless, more cruel, more uncaring by the day. ” Dyson is all too familiar with the claims of innocence and the kneejerk defensiveness that will surely greet this book, and yet he sets out to conquer such denial not only with the difficult truth but also, astonishingly, with love. “Beloved,” he writes, in the voice of one ministering to the sick, “your white innocence is a burden to you, a burden to the nation, a burden to our progress. It is time to let it go, to let it die in the place of the black bodies it wills into nonbeing. ” Many white readers may wince, as I did, to hear their own indifference to black suffering named with such precision, and some, desperate not to face their involvement in America’s systems of racial oppression, might abandon this book altogether. But that would be to miss an essential lesson. For again and again Dyson makes it clear that more than white guilt, he seeks action, and more than condemnation, he wants change. He wants readers to wake from their sleep of ignorance about “what it means to be black in America. ” Reading his praise for James Baldwin, I couldn’t help thinking that the same is true of Dyson himself: “His words drip with the searing eloquence of an evangelist of race determined to get to the brutal bottom of America’s original sin. ” If there is a criticism here, it is that Dyson gathers steam slowly, and his opening “Hymns of Praise” to   artists give little indication of the moral power to come. But this is a small quibble with a deeply serious, urgent book, which should take its place in the tradition of Baldwin’s “The Fire Next Time” and King’s “Why We Can’t Wait. ” The comparison might at first seem hyperbolic, but like those books, “Tears We Cannot Stop” is a lament, originating from within the grieving heart of black America, aimed directly at white readers who are often too frightened, or indifferent, or ashamed, to look a man like Michael Eric Dyson in the eyes. I can only hope that others will read and be changed by this book. It ends with a desperate plea for white Americans to rise up in defense of, and in solidarity with, our   brothers and sisters. In response, I say simply: Amen."

12 things to know about Pluto," (CNN) NASA’s New Horizons probe flew past Pluto on July 14, 2015 becoming the first spacecraft to study Pluto up close. Here’s what you need to know about the icy world. 1. Is Pluto still a planet? Yes, but it’s now a different kind of planet. Many of us grew up thinking there were nine planets in our solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) touched off a huge debate when it reclassified Pluto as a dwarf planet. Why the change? Astronomers started finding many more objects in our solar system that are about the same size as Pluto. Rather than call all of these objects planets, the IAU created a new category called dwarf planets. So far, five dwarf planets have been recognized by the IAU: Pluto, Ceres, Eris, Makemake and Haumea. Scientists expect to eventually confirm many, many more dwarf planets. Dwarf planet Ceres currently is being explored by NASA’s Dawn spacecraft.  2. Where is Pluto? It’s about 3. 6 billion miles (5. 8 billion kilometers) away from the sun in the Kuiper Belt, a   region of space beyond Neptune where thousands of other small, icy objects orbit. The Kuiper Belt is named in honor of   astronomer Gerard Kuiper, who theorized about the existence of small bodies beyond Neptune in the 1950s. Objects in this region are called Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs). 3. How big is Pluto: It’s about the size of the United States, said New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern.  4. Does Pluto have any moons? It has five: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos and Styx. 5. What’s the weather like on Pluto? Very cold. It’s about 375 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit below zero.  6. Does Pluto have gravity? Not much. Scientists say a person who weighs 100 pounds on Earth would weigh only 7 pounds on Pluto. 7. Does Pluto have an atmosphere? Scientists say it has a thin atmosphere and that New Horizons has instruments to help learn more about it. 8. What color is Pluto? It’s reddish brown. 9. Who discovered Pluto? Pluto originally was called Planet X by Percival Lowell, the founder of the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. He was sure a planet existed beyond Neptune but, despite his efforts, he died in 1916 without finding the planet. Amateur astronomer Clyde Tombaugh of Kansas was hired by Lowell Observatory to continue the search and discovered Pluto on February 18, 1930. 10. How did Planet X become Pluto?    Venetia Burney of Oxford, England, suggested the name. 11. Is Pluto at the end of our solar system? No, scientists think there are thousands of other worlds beyond Pluto in the Kuiper Belt. 12. Can I see Pluto with my own eyes? Like Clyde Tombaugh, you can see it. But you will need a good telescope."
Rob Reiner: Trump ’Most Unqualified Person Ever To Run For President In My Lifetime’ - Breitbart,"Wednesday on MSNBC, actor and director Rob Reiner said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was “the single most unqualified person ever to run for president in my lifetime. ”  Reiner said  “Well, yes. We talk about somebody coming from a reality show. Running for president is not a reality show. It’s actual reality. And this man is the single most unqualified person ever to run for president in my lifetime. I mean, just to hear what you just said, we had an entire presidency taken down in the ’70s over Watergate, and that was a   to the national Democratic headquarters that didn’t amount to anything because they didn’t get anything. Here we have a   to the Democratic national headquarters where everything is stolen, and there’s a conceivable connection to the Trump campaign. That to me is just    insane. I can’t even believe we’re having this conversation here. I mean, this is    crazy. We’re in crazy land here. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN"

Republicans are choosing their party over the country in denying Trump’s abuse of power,"’  ’ ”     James Comey’s written statement, released to the public on the     eve of his testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee, is a     remarkable document.   ” ’     In it, the former FBI director details interactions with the     president of the United States that range from inappropriate to     transgressive —  actions that undermine the rule of law as we     understand it.   ’ ’     Comey recounts a private meeting with President Trump, a     dinner, where the president asked Comey for his personal     loyalty. ”I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,” said Trump,     according to Comey’’s sworn testimony. (Trump’’s personal     attorney issued a statement following Comey’’s testimony saying     that the president ”never told Mr. Comey, ‘I need loyalty, I     expect loyalty’’ in form or substance,” essentially accusing the     former FBI director of perjury before the Senate.)   ’ ’     Comey recounts a second meeting, alone in the Oval Office,     where Trump urged Comey to end an investigation of former     National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. ”I hope you can see     your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He’’s a     good guy. I hope you can let this go,” said Trump in Comey’’s     recollection, which Comey says he documented in contemporaneous     notes. (Trump’’s personal lawyer said that the president never     suggested ”Comey let Flynn go,” again, essentially accusing him     of perjury.) In two separate conversations, both over the     phone, Trump reportedly urged Comey to ”lift the cloud” over     his administration and ”get out” that he wasn’’t personally     under investigation.   ’ ’     In his Thursday testimony to the committee, Comey wouldn’’t say     if he felt this rose to ”obstruction of justice,” the charge     that ultimately led to Richard Nixon’’s resignation from the     presidency, saying it was up to the special counsel Robert     Mueller to determine. ”I don’’t think it’’s for me to say whether     the conversation I had with the president was an effort to     obstruct,” he said about the conversation regarding Flynn. ”I     took it as a very disturbing thing, very concerning, but that’’s     a conclusion I’’m sure the special counsel will work towards to     find out the intention and whether that’’s an offense.” He later     said it was ”Mueller’’s job” to ”sort out” whether or not     obstruction has been committed.   ’ ’     Whether or not the president’’s actions ultimately rise to     ”obstruction” according to Mueller’’s investigation, however,     it’’s clear these are serious allegations that suggest a kind of     lawlessness in the White House, from a president with little     regard for the norms that govern conduct in the Oval Office.     Trump’’s alleged demand for Comey’’s personal loyalty —  in a     government where officials pledge allegiance to the     Constitution, not the president —  would itself be a profound     attack on the rule of law. In an ideal world, or at least a     more functional one, lawmakers on both sides would see and     treat this as a crisis that demands resolution, lest it corrode     American democracy.   ’ ”     But that’s not what we have. Just one of our two parties is     interested in checking this president’s abuse. The other, the     Republican Party, is indifferent, content to tolerate Trump’s     misconduct as long as it doesn’t interrupt or interfere with     its political agenda.   ” ’     What defined Thursday’’s hearing, in fact, was the degree to     which Republicans downplayed obvious examples of     bad —  potentially illegal —  behavior and sought to exonerate Trump     rather than grapple with Comey’’s damning allegations about the     president. Sen. James Risch of Idaho, for example, pressed     Comey on his claim that President Trump had asked the then —  FBI     director to drop the investigation into Flynn, suggesting     that —  because Trump didn’’t give a direct order —  we ought to     ignore the clear subtext of the president’’s statement. Sen.     James Lankford of Oklahoma described Trump’’s actions on behalf     of Flynn as a ”light touch.”   ’ ”     Other Republican committee members, like Sens. John Cornyn of     Texas and John McCain of Arizona, steered the conversation     toward the FBI’s investigation of Hillary Clinton’s private     email server. Still others, like Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida,     defended Trump’s actions, blasting leaks to the press as     efforts to undermine his administration.   ” ’  ’ ’     Republican committee members were aided in all of this by the     official organs of the GOP, which treated the hearings as a     distraction —  a partisan frivolity driven by Democrats and the     press. ”Director Comey’’s opening statement confirms he told     President Trump three times that he was not under     investigation,” said a statement from the Republican National     Committee that recommended a strategy of deflection. The RNC     additionally argued that ”Director Comey lost confidence of     both sides of the aisle, and the president was justified in     firing him.” House Speaker Paul Ryan, commenting on the     procedures, defended Trump’’s potentially illegal behavior as     the mistakes of a novice. ”He’’s just new to this, and probably     wasn’’t steeped in   protocols,” he said.   ’ ’     Congress is tasked with executive oversight. Congress is     supposed to intervene when presidents and their officials     violate laws, norms, and standards of conduct. Instead,     virtually the entire Republican Party is running interference     on behalf of a president who, by his own account,     fired the FBI director in order to block the investigation into     Russia and protect his friends and associates. Congressional     Republicans have taken, essentially, a ”see no evil” position     on actions that in any other circumstance they would view as     illegal. For Republicans, it seems, rule of law is less     important than partisan loyalty.   ’ ”     Indeed, there’s every indication that these Republicans see and     understand the problem. Rubio, himself, blasted Trump     throughout the presidential campaign. But he, like his     colleagues, has made a choice to cover for Trump and defend his     conduct, regardless of what that means for the country. It goes     beyond Comey and Russia. Few Republicans have any appetite to     deal with Trump’s financial entanglements, his vast conflicts     of interest, or his   siphoning of federal funds to     his private properties and resorts.   ” ’  ’ ”     James Comey’s sworn Senate testimony, both written and spoken,     is evidence of one political crisis: A president with little     regard for rule of law who sees no problem in bringing his     influence and authority to bear on federal investigations. The     Republican reaction —  the effort to protect Trump and discredit     Comey —  is evidence of another: a crisis of       where the nation’s governing party has opted against oversight     and accountability, abdicating its role in our system of checks     and balances and allowing that president free rein, as long as     he signs its legislation and nominates its judges.   ” ”     Americans face two major crises, each feeding into the other.     Republicans aren’t bound to partisan loyalty. They can choose     country over party, rule of law over ideology. But they won’t,     and the rest of us will pay for it.   ” ”James Comey’s written statement, released to. ..” ’’ ’’ ’’"
Farmers are trying to turn Russia into an ’agricultural superpower’,"’’ ’The very first thing Alexander Sayapin has to say to a Western journalist who’’s made a long trek out to his   dairy some 150 miles from Moscow? ”Thank you for the sanctions. ”’ ”The sanctions Mr. Sayapin is referring to, a   ban on food products imported from the European Union, were actually . They came in retaliation for Western sanctions leveled against Russia almost two years ago over its role in Ukraine’s crisis. But never mind.” ’His point is that the sudden disappearance of cheap EU dairy goods from the Russian market created an opportunity. With financing from a major   supermarket chain, Azbuka V’’Kusa, he built in this deeply rural region a small dairy that now processes local milk into a variety of products, and sells as much as it can make under the supermarket’’s   brand name and his own ”Farmer Sayapin” label.’ ”Small farmers like Sayapin, long ignored by Russian customers and investors alike, are breathing new life into Russia’s agricultural markets, allowing the country to feed itself without imports  —   and even to become an exporter itself.” ’”We’’ve tripled our production in the past year, and we’’ve carved out a place in the market,” he says. ”Even if they lift the sanctions tomorrow, we’’re already here. We’’ve learned a lot, reduced our costs, and we’’re ready to compete. ”’ ”Russia is in the  and things look to get tougher this year. But agriculture appears to be rebounding briskly. Officials insist that’s not just because of sanctions, or the plunging ruble  —   which favors domestic production and makes imports more expensive  —   but the result of much more fundamental   factors.” ’More than a decade of confusion over how to decollectivize giant Soviet farms left the agricultural sector in ruins and made Russia dependent on foreign food imports. A new land code introduced in 2001 made it possible to create   private farms, but development was slow. In 2012 the government introduced a sweeping program of subsidies to promote private farming, including  controlled prices for fertilizers, support for  and state financing for.’ ”It’s clearly had an impact. For instance, Russia was until recently a major importer of chicken and pork from North America. Now it is   in fowl and last year became a  for the first time in history. Russian agricultural exports were  more than the country’s arms sales, and are expected to grow this year.” ’The current crisis, perhaps amplified by  has also spurred a revival of . Producers of old ingredients like beets, cabbage, buckwheat, tvorog (  cottage cheese) and kefir (a yogurt drink) are reportedly booming.’ ’”Farmers are in a very favorable position these days. They can get grants and subsidized loans from federal and local government, and the current economic situation works for them,” says Alexander Tsigankov, an official with the Kaluga regional ministry of agriculture. ”People are coming back from the cities, because there are finally   jobs in farming, and that’’s easing our chronic labor shortages. In  the farming sector has grown by 17 percent in the past two years. ”’ ’Mr. Tsigankov scoffs at the   possibility that Western sanctions  and all the products of vastly superior European agribusiness will flood back into the market, perhaps knocking local farmers back on their heels.’ ’”So what?” he says. ”If all those products come back, there will be price wars. And our farmers, who count their costs in rubles, will win most of the battles against goods that are priced in euros. Of course there will always be niche markets for French cheeses and Italian cured meats and such. But we’’re well on our way to producing enough of most foodstuffs to feed our own population. ”’ ’However, he adds, ”I hope our government has had enough time to think over the problem of food security and will protect our own farming” so as not to leave Russia vulnerable to sanctions in future.’ ”The hard road back from   farming is on display in the village of Plotskaya, where a few modern homes sprout amid decaying former collective farm buildings. Former members of the collective farm, Sergei Fetisov and his family, have gradually amalgamated much of the old farm’s former lands by buying out some former members, convincing others to join together and pool their efforts. They have several hundred head of cattle, produce their own feed. They also harvested about 3, 000 tons of potatoes last year.” ’”I never thought this transition from socialism to capitalism was going to take so long or be so complicated,” Mr. Fetisov says. He and many of his neighbors are  a branch of Russian Orthodoxy that was persecuted in the past. This shared religious bond has spurred them to cooperate.’ ’But he says they rely on their own efforts, not government assistance. ”Things are going fine now, but I worry about future stability. Whatever happens, we’’re   here. We’’ve rebuilt this village, and we will stay. For us, farming is a way of life, not a business,” he says.’ ”Farming is a business for Andrei Davidov. The former Soviet military officer started his cattle farm on unused land 25 years ago, so he didn’t face any of the legal problems of transitioning from the collective farm system. A sojourn with friendly cattle ranchers in the US in the 1990s was a big help in showing him the ropes, he says. He now has about 150 Hereford cattle, which he butchers himself, and he makes a comfortable living supplying a supermarket chain and a couple of restaurants in the nearby city of Kaluga.” ’”It’’s all good for me. I’’m doing well,” he says.’ ”Most of the beef served in the former Soviet Union was old dairy cows sent to slaughter, and so raising beef cattle is a relatively new industry for Russia. By many accounts, it’s one that is .  But unlike pigs or chickens, beef has a long production cycle, and Russia is still far from being  .” ’”What this country needs is 800, 000 private farms raising cattle, like in the US, and then maybe we’’ll be an agricultural superpower,” Mr. Davidov says.’"
"GOP senator cites ’civilization-warping crisis of public trust,’ demands Trump explain Obama wiretapping claims","’  ’ ’   Republican Sen.

Five things we learned from the Sally Yates hearing," (CNN) Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper have now filled in some key pieces of the sprawling puzzle presented by the Russia investigations.  Here are the top five things we learned from their appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism on Monday: 1. Yates delivered a forceful argument to the White House that   security adviser Michael Flynn could be blackmailed by the Russians, As soon as she read the details of Michael Flynn’s interview with the FBI, at the end of January, Yates called White House counsel Don McGahn and said they needed to talk in private, she testified. Yates brought one of her top staffers with her on the afternoon of January 26 to meet with McGahn and one of his top aides inside a secure facility on the White House grounds so they could discuss the FBI’s interview of Flynn. It was then, she testified before senators Monday, that she warned McGahn that President Donald Trump’s national security adviser could easily become a blackmail target for Russians, based on the answers Flynn gave to the FBI. ”That created a compromised situation, a situation where the national security adviser essentially could be blackmailed by the Russians. Finally, we told them that we were giving them all of this information so that they could take action, the action that they deemed appropriate,” she said. McGahn called Yates and asked her to return the next morning, January 27, when she testified that he asked her about four main concerns: Why did it matter to the Justice Department if Flynn lied to Vice President Mike Pence? What criminal statutes did Flynn potentially violate? Would taking action against Flynn immediately interfere with the FBI’s investigation? Could he see the underlying evidence collected in Flynn’s interview?  Yates explained that any official publicly repeating the lie that Flynn had not discussed sanctions with Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak, was increasing the chance Flynn would be blackmailed.  ”Every time this lie was repeated and the misrepresentations were getting more and more specific, as they were coming out, every time that happened, it increased the compromise and to state the obvious: You don’t want your national security adviser compromised with the Russians,” Yates said.  Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, declined comment when reached by CNN Monday. 2. Trump is increasingly looking alone in his belief that Russia did not interfere to help him in the 2016 election, Trump has repeatedly called the investigations of possible coordination between his campaign aides and Russia ”fake news” and, last week, said it may have been China that was behind the hacking.  That’s an assessment that’s looking increasingly detached from US intelligence officials. ”To me, the evidence was overwhelming, and very compelling, that the Russians did this,” Clapper testified, when asked about Trump’s most recent assertions.  Then, prompted by Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy, Clapper said Trump may still be helping the Russians by denying their involvement. ”You could rationalize that it helps the Russians by obfuscating who was actually responsible,” Clapper said. 3. Clapper and Yates undercut one of the Trump White House’s strongest arguments, Throughout the Russia probes, the Trump White House has pointed to testimony earlier this year from Clapper that he had seen no evidence in the January intelligence report of collusion between the President’s campaign and Russia. That was before FBI Director James Comey publicly revealed that the FBI was, in fact, investigating that question. Clapper said Comey’s March 20 testimony was the first he heard of the FBI investigation. He later said that his original assessment was that there was no evidence he had seen worth including in the intelligence assessment    but Yates later said that she could not answer the question because she did not want to reveal any classified information.  The implication from both officials’ testimonies was that there may, indeed, be evidence of collusion    this after months of the White House arguing that Clapper was clear there is no evidence.  4. The Senate investigations have strong strains of partisanship, Monday’s hearing with Yates and Clapper was clearly focused on Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, but Republican and Democratic senators still used it to land some partisan shots.  Republican senators grilled Yates on why she refused to enforce the first executive order that imposed a travel ban issued by Trump.  ”I don’t mean any disrespect: Who appointed you to the Supreme Court?” Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, told Yates in a comment that immediately lit up Twitter. And Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz went to town on Yates, arguing that she may have broken the law by refusing to defend the order. She rebutted him by pointing to a later court ruling that supported her argument that she had a greater duty to protect against discrimination and uphold the Constitution.  Democrats, meanwhile, pushed hard with lines of attack clearly aimed at damaging Trump himself, not necessarily digging into what happened in the 2016 elections.  Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, one of the Senate’s most staunchly liberal members, took Yates on a winding line of questioning that ended with Trump possibly appearing on the witness stand in a hypothetical court trial against Flynn. At the end of the hypothetical exercise, Blumenthal pressed Yates if that was even remotely possible.  Yates responded: ”Potentially.”  The Senate Russia investigators may have maintained the air of being the adults in Congress investigating Russia’s interference. But the Senate Judiciary Committee has proved over the last two hearings (including last week’s with Comey) that partisanship is still a powerful force in its own inquiry.  5. The media matters, Yates was fired by Trump one day after it came out that she had refused to defend his travel ban and four days after she first alerted McGahn about Flynn. Meanwhile, it took 18 days for the White House to fire Flynn after Yates first told McGahn about his FBI interview.  ”Without that published report, and without the free press telling us a lot of what went on, Michael Flynn might still be sitting in the White House as national security adviser,” said Blumenthal, referring to the original Washington Post report about Flynn’s phone calls with Kislyak."
"In the New Hollywood, Sumner Redstone Is a Man Out of Time - The New York Times","This is a town built on stories, the more salacious the better. So it comes as not much of a surprise that the twilight of Sumner M. Redstone’s epic career has become the stuff of   conversation, especially among those who knew the man when he was perhaps the most powerful figure in Hollywood. Peter Bart, a former producer and film executive who served as the editor of Variety from 1989 to 2009, was dining recently with friends at Off Vine, a quiet Hollywood restaurant housed in a     bungalow, when the inevitable came up. Others at the table included an   actress who knew Mr. Redstone well. “And they wondered, ‘How could Sumner get himself into this situation? ’” Mr. Bart said. “It is very sad. ” Details about the    tycoon’s private life surfaced during a   lawsuit, which fizzled in court last week. The story that emerged fell somewhere between film noir at its sleazy best and “King Lear. ” Mr. Bart said the billionaire’s plight was coming up a lot lately among   people. “In some cases, there were expressions of empathy,” he said. “But there is impatience with Sumner, too, that he couldn’t keep his private life private. ” The legal proceedings revealed an aging lion who craved sex and steak, although he was too ill to leave his Beverly Park mansion and took his meals through a feeding tube. Court papers described him as “a living ghost” and told of female escorts making visits to his bedside while a nurse sometimes looked on. As Mr. Redstone’s former lover and onetime   caretaker, Manuela Herzer, 51, battled his daughter, Shari Redstone, 62, for control of his daily care  —   not to mention what she saw as her rightful place in his will  —   this   melodrama had it all: wild shopping sprees,   excursions, whispers of a sex tape and, in a bit part, an angry   who seemed like a character out of a Coen brothers movie. Hollywood dynasties have long run into complications in the final reel. In the 1950s, a philandering Jack L. Warner undercut his brother Harry for control of the family’s Warner Bros. studio, and the two never spoke again. In the early 1970s, Darryl F. Zanuck was ousted from 20th Century Fox in a coup, which his wife orchestrated to avenge her husband’s treatment of their son. While those spectacles drew their share of press attention and loose talk, today’s corporate, almost bloodless entertainment industry seems less tolerant of executives who depart from the script. Sure, the stereotype of the hardhearted,   executive persists. But Mr. Redstone’s eccentricities  —   he once boasted that he shaved poolside in the nude  —   and the recent disclosure of his sexual exploits seem out of step with the airbrushed culture of   Los Angeles. “Sumner is caught in a time warp,” Mr. Bart said. The legal fracas has changed Mr. Redstone’s public image from a firebrand whose business acumen and ruthlessness won him control of Viacom, Paramount Pictures and CBS, a $40 billion empire, into something quite different. In the local parlance, he lost the plot. The hubris that precedes a fall was evident in 2009, when he told Larry King, “I have no intention of ever retiring or of dying,” and once again in 2014, when Mr. Redstone told The Hollywood Reporter, “I’m not going to die. ” Recent press attention has deflated such boasts. And secrets Mr. Redstone might have taken to the grave he reserved for himself in Massachusetts, where he was born in 1923, became the stuff of Internet chatter when Ms. Herzer  —   whom he banished from his Beverly Park home last year  —   filed suit. “This is all very Shakespearean, with the family, all the people taking over the kingdom,” said Michael Medavoy, a producer who knows Mr. Redstone. “It’s a tragedy. But my question is, is it a tragic comedy or is it a tragic drama?” After Judge David J. Cowan of Los Angeles County Superior Court tossed the case last Monday, Ms. Herzer filed a new lawsuit against Ms. Redstone. There is talk that Mr. Redstone’s lawyers may pursue a suit, too, meaning the situation could drag on. Mr. Redstone has long been known for his volatility. Across the decades, he has collected enemies the way residents in nearby Malibu pick up sea glass along Carbon Beach. The executives he has crossed include Tom Freston, David Geffen, Mel Karmazin and Barry Diller. In 2006, he split with Tom Cruise over the actor’s erratic behavior and stumping for Scientology, ending Mr. Cruise’s production deal at Paramount. (The star got some measure of revenge with his caustic,    portrayal of a character said to be based on Mr. Redstone in the Hollywood satire “Tropic Thunder. ”) “He was a   man,” Mr. Medavoy said. “But those guys can be difficult. You have to look at it all in context. The great scions of industry, the guys who made a zillion dollars, are tough guys. Those folks don’t make a lot of friends. ” On a recent evening, Christine Peters was nursing a Moscow mule in the Tower Bar at the Sunset Tower Hotel in West Hollywood, Calif. Ms. Peters, a movie producer, dated Mr. Redstone in the late 1990s and remained friends after he moved to the Beverly Park mansion in 2003. She said she had not seen the   tycoon in two years. Despite his position, Mr. Redstone was not a creature of the scene, she said. He avoided galas and opening nights, preferring intimate dinners at Dan Tana’s, the dimly lit,   Italian place on Santa Monica Boulevard with   booths, waiters in black bow ties and bartenders in red   jackets. If she arrived late for a meal, Ms. Peters said, she would find him alone and impatient, drumming his fingers on the table. Mr. Redstone, who was badly burned in a 1979 hotel fire in Boston, did not like to show weakness, Ms. Peters said, and his closest personal relationships seemed transactional, rooted in business. But his devotion to his empire seems to not have given him much protection against hits taken in the recent imbroglio. “He would rather be broke than humiliated and publicly embarrassed, his dignity lost,” Ms. Peters said. “Calling him a ‘living ghost’ is the most hurtful, saying he could not make lucid decisions. That’s where the knife hits hardest for him. ” She added that he regarded as his only worthy rival Rupert Murdoch, the    media king who recently married the former supermodel Jerry Hall. A small crowd gathered at the Vibrato Grill Jazz club here in the Bel Air neighborhood at 6 p. m. for Mr. Redstone’s 92nd birthday celebration a year ago. It was one of his last public appearances. The guests included top executives in his employ, including Leslie Moonves of CBS, Philippe Dauman of Viacom, as well as Brad Grey of Paramount. Tony Bennett serenaded him with his 1962 hit, “I Left My Heart in San Francisco. ” A figurine on the birthday cake was particularly telling. It depicted Mr. Redstone as a corporate titan in a suit and red tie, phone in one hand, television remote in the other. Next to the miniature Mr. Redstone on top of the cake was a tiny stock ticker that showed the prices of six major media companies, including Viacom and CBS. Mr. Redstone sat flanked by his caretaker at the time, Ms. Herzer, and his lover, Sydney Holland, who lived at his estate and has figured into his recent convoluted legal troubles. Mr. Redstone reportedly gave Ms. Holland some $70 million in cash and gifts before kicking her out of his house in the days before he turned on Ms. Herzer. At the party, both women wore evening dresses. The details of the tycoon’s private life probably would not have come to light if Mr. Redstone’s two paramours had not participated in a Vanity Fair profile of him in the June 2015 issue. Ms. Herzer was photographed for the article in a shimmering,   gown. Ms. Holland’s glamour shot showed her on a chaise lounge in Pasadena, Calif. Both gushed about the riches their benefactor had bestowed upon them, which did not sit well with Shari Redstone and a former convict named George Pilgrim, who was dating Ms. Holland at the time. Mr. Redstone’s hostile manner of conducting business and his tendency to go it alone may have also contributed to his   predicament. In a town where business relationships and genuine friendships are often one and the same, his story has become a cautionary tale. “More than one person has said to me, ‘I don’t want to end up alone, at home and angry,’” said Janice Min, who oversees content for Billboard and The Hollywood Reporter. “It’s almost a    approach. Now, executives drive their kids to school. ” On May 6, an   videotaped deposition of Mr. Redstone’s testimony, shot a day earlier, was played in the courtroom so that the judge could make a determination on whether the media tycoon was mentally fit. Despite his speech difficulties, the nonagenarian used foul language to express his contempt for Ms. Herzer. “I hate her,” he said, adding, “I want Manuela out of my life. ” For many who read the transcript, it was classic Sumner. “He was no more likable a person in old age,” Ms. Min said. “He hasn’t softened into a grandfatherly figure. ” Further, she added: “He doesn’t want a quiet goodbye. He is a ruthless negotiator to the end. ” At the Urth Caffé on Melrose Avenue in West Hollywood on yet another cloudless morning, the patio was crowded with   huddled over bowls of coffee and plates of coconut cake. They were buzzing about their new   or the latest Hulu series. For this generation, a   macher like Mr. Redstone seems as alien as the original Hollywood bosses who built the world’s most glamorous business on this   outpost. “He’s obviously very wealthy and influential,” said Eric Dahan, a    chief executive of InstaBrand, a   that connects brands with influencers on Instagram. “But I’m not too familiar with the case, and I don’t think a lot of my generation are. ” He called Mr. Redstone an “icon,” but confessed that he and others his age were focused on another businessman lately in the news. “People in my social circle care more about Donald Trump and whether he will become president,” he said."
Protesters in Venezuela Crush Police Officers with Stolen Bus,"Student protesters in the   Venezuelan state of Táchira killed two police officers and injured four others by driving a hijacked bus into a crowd of law enforcement officials attempting to subdue a protest. [The incident occurred during a larger protest against public transportation fare hikes coming to San Cristóbal, the capital of Venezuela’s Táchira state, in April. Socialist President Nicolás Maduro has enacted a public transportation fare hike nationwide, likely to more deeply affect areas far from the capital like San Cristóbal.  A group of masked young men, believed to be students at the local Los Andes   Institute of Technology (IUT) reportedly stole seventeen public transportation vehicles from government officials early Tuesday morning, threatening to kill bus drivers who did not give up their vehicles. Some hours later, as police assembled to block the coming protests, one of the hijacked buses stormed through the crowd, killing two officers. The incident was caught on video. (Warning: Graphic Content) Photos of the aftermath show blood spilled in the streets where the bus passed. Fallecen 2 funcionarios policiales, uno de la PNB y #Politachira en medio de disturbios por aumento de pasaje pic. twitter.   —   Evany Sandoval (@EvanySandoval) March 29, 2016,  The deceased officers have been identified as    Nicolle Pérez Soler, a member of Táchira state police, and    Otto Márquez, a member of the Bolivarian National Guard (GNB). Both are said to have died from blunt trauma: the bus drove over their heads. Táchira police are investigating Pérez Soler’s presence at the protests, as she was still in training and “should not have been there,” according to police spokespersons. “La efectivo policial femenina muerta estaba en prueba y no debía estar ahí” dicen los efectivos de #Politachira,  —   Williams Amaya (@williamsAmaya) March 30, 2016,  Táchira state police announced the arrest today of    José Gregorio Sulbarán Muñoz, a student at IUT Los Andes, for the incident. He is among more than fifty student protesters arrested Tuesday for attempting to assemble in protest against the fare hikes. San Cristóbal’s La Nación newspaper notes that many of these protesters used stones and Molotov cocktails against police, who responded with tear gas and gunshots. #Ahora| Capturado en Las Vegas de Táriba el criminal que arrolló y asesinó a 2 policías en los disturbios en el IUT pic. twitter.   —   POLICIA DEL TACHIRA (@policiatachira) March 30, 2016,  Táchira’s governor, the Chavista José Vielma Mora, issued a statement on his Twitter account condemning the violence. “We reject any act that threatens stability and the lives of citizens. Violence brings bad consequences  …     Honor and glory to the brave men and women of the police force, who risk their lives to protect the people. ” While a member of the leftist United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) Vielma Mora has been publicly critical of President Maduro’s use of state violence to subdue peaceful   protests, calling for the liberation of opposition leader Leopoldo López, who has been imprisoned for more than two years after organizing peaceful protests in the capital, Caracas. Táchira has long been one of the nation’s most   states, the site of much of the worst police violence against protesters in the past two years. San Cristóbal, in particular, has been the site of significant police violence, notably the home of    Kluiverth Roa, gunned down while walking home from school last year for shouting “stop the repression” in public. San Cristóbal’s mayor, the   Daniel Ceballos, has been a political prisoner in the nation since March 2014, arrested for allegedly aiding “irrational violence” in the city. Journalists reporting on his arrest  —   a midnight raid by secret police  —   were also arrested. Ceballos is one of many prisoners of conscience in Venezuela  —   along with López and Caracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma  —   who may benefit from the passing of a new amnesty law passed by the National Assembly this week, now in the hands of the opposition. Maduro has vowed to disregard the law, asserting that no prisoner will be released."
"A Fumble on a Key Fafsa Tool, and a Failure to Communicate - The New York Times","Applying for financial aid for college got a lot harder this month, in the thick of application season, but it took federal agencies nearly a week to explain what was happening. To get aid for college from federal or state governments, as well as from colleges, students and their parents must fill out the Fafsa (the Free Application for Federal Student Aid). The notoriously complicated form, which is longer than the typical 1040 tax form, collects detailed information from students and families about income, expenses and taxes. On March 3, families logging onto the website for federal aid found that a key component of the online application had stopped functioning. The component, known as the Data Retrieval Tool, automatically fills in a Fafsa application with information from an applicant’s tax return, via a data connection with the Internal Revenue Service. Without the tool, applicants have to transcribe tax information from their old returns or order tax transcripts from the I. R. S. (which can take several weeks). Twitter started to fill with frustrated messages from applicants wondering when the tool would be back up. Student advocacy organizations, such as the National College Access Network (N. C. A. N.) pleaded with the Department of Education and the I. R. S. to explain the situation and resolve it as quickly as possible, but received no response. N. C. A. N. and others began urging families to contact their elected representatives. Six days later, on Thursday morning, the Department of Education and the I. R. S. jointly released a statement saying that the I. R. S. had “decided to temporarily suspend the Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) as a precautionary step following concerns that information from the tool could potentially be misused by identity thieves. ” The agencies declined to elaborate, and it was unclear whether a breach had occurred or had only been feared. The tool has been in use for five years, with no reports of identity theft stemming from its use. If the move was, as the statement said, a precautionary step, waiting to repair it until after the peak of the aid application season would have been far less disruptive. Students can still apply for student aid, and it seems they should not postpone their application in hopes that the data tool will return anytime soon. While the agencies have provided no specific date, they have indicated it will be down at least several weeks. Completing the Fafsa is now going to require more legwork, more paperwork and more time, and applicants will be putting themselves in a difficult position if they wait until the last minute to apply. Fafsas completed without using the data tool are more likely to be chosen for “verification,” an audit that requires applicants to submit additional paperwork to prove that their tax information is accurate. This further slows the process. The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators has asked the Department of Education to scale back verification requirements given the data tool outage. Federal aid such as Pell grants and Stafford loans have no firm deadline students can apply all year. But many states have limited aid budgets that are rationed on a     basis. And colleges have deadlines for their own aid, which is drawn from endowments and tuition revenue and which is limited at most schools. Delayed applications may mean, for many students, no aid from states or school. The unannounced suspension of the data tool comes at a critical moment in the aid cycle. March is a peak time for aid applications, second only to February in the volume of Fafsa submissions. The deadlines for 19 state aid programs are approaching, according to Sarah Pingel of the Education Commission of the States. The I. R. S. suspended the data tool just as it was benefiting more applicants than ever before. In past years, the Fafsa application called for tax data from the previous year, even though most filers wouldn’t have had returns processed by this point. But now those applying for aid for the   academic year are allowed to submit information from their 2015 tax return (in fact, it’s a requirement to use 2015 and not 2016 returns)  —   a change made in part to allow many more people to use the data tool. It is not just current students who are affected by the shutdown. Borrowers applying for or renewing their eligibility for   repayment plans such as Pay as You Earn use the data tool to verify their income information, which is used to calculate payments. The Trump administration has tightened social media and other communications from agencies. Coordinating communication across multiple agencies may be particularly challenging, as the administration may require approvals from political appointees who are not yet fully in place. This may explain the silence from the education department while the tool was disabled for a week. The problem with this approach is that it takes a broad network of financial aid offices, aid professionals and advocacy groups to keep the aid system functioning. College offices put together aid packages and communicate with students, for example. If this intricate infrastructure is not kept informed about changes, the aid system will grind to a halt."

Football star-turned-addict gets second chance,"Commerce, Georgia (CNN) On Friday nights, the crowds would pack the high school football stadium in this small Georgia town, many just to catch a glimpse of the main attraction: #47, Ronald Moon. With his blinding speed, Moon was as bright a star as any the state had ever seen on a high school football field. His talents made him a starting running back for a   college football program and put him on the verge of a possible NFL career. But just as fans were once drawn to watch him play, Moon was pulled down another path in life    one consumed by a drug addiction that eventually led to a prison cell, where he expected to spend the rest of his life. That was until he received some unexpected news from Washington. On August 3, President Barack Obama shortened the sentences of 214 prisoners, including that of Ronald Moon.  To date, Obama has commuted the sentences of 1, 000 inmates    more than the past 11 presidents combined. More than a third of those inmates were serving life sentences dealt during America’s   ”war on drugs.” Over the coming months and years, many will get a second chance on the outside. Now, a new administration is heading to Washington. Sentencing reform advocates don’t expect   Donald Trump to follow the precedent set by Obama, despite the overcrowding and skyrocketing operating costs plaguing the federal prison system.  And while some policies implemented in the last eight years appear in jeopardy, freed prisoners like Moon will be an enduring part of Obama’s legacy, even if reform advocates say there is still much work to be done. ’He had something about him’ With a slight limp from his arthritic knees, Moon walks like a man who has taken his share of hits in life. But the most damaging blows landed off the football field. Between the white lines, there were few people who could stop ”Runt,” as family and friends know him. In his hometown of Commerce and surrounding northeastern Georgia, Runt is still a legend among those who saw him play. Ray Lamb coached Moon for four years at Commerce High School. And in a career that spanned 35 years in high school and another 19 with the University of Georgia’s powerhouse football program, Coach Lamb has seen some talented players. He admits he may be biased, but he puts the running back from Commerce up against any who have ever played in the state. At    and 155 pounds, Moon was not big    especially for his position. But the statistics he racked up didn’t match his relatively small stature. By the end of his career, Moon held almost every high school rushing record in the state of Georgia. As a senior in 1973, he rushed for 2, 501 yards, a record he held until it was broken by Herschel Walker, who later won the Heisman Trophy. ”I’m not kidding when I say back in ’72 and ’73, people would come from all over just to see him play,” said Lamb, who is now retired. ”He had something about him.” Moon went on to play college football at Memphis State and then the University of Louisville, but never achieved the level of success he had expected. After college, he went undrafted by NFL teams, but still clung to the hope that he would get a shot in the pros.  His agent arranged tryouts with a few teams, but that dream was soon dashed    a night of partying ended with Moon falling and breaking his wrist. Injured and seemingly out of options, Moon returned home to Commerce. ”My agent told me to stay in shape,” Moon said. ”He had me until next year, but I just went to the streets and I buried myself in drugs.” ’When he didn’t show up, I knew something was wrong’ Cassandra Moon, 45, is the oldest of Ronald Moon’s seven children. She was born when her father was just 15 years old and remembers the pride she felt watching him on TV playing college football. But after football, Ronald Moon’s life became a roller coaster of addiction, punctuated by arrests, stints behind bars, and a few fleeting years of sobriety. When Cassandra was a teenager, her father’s absence at one of her basketball games was the first sign of his addiction. ”That’s something that he had supported me in, and when he didn’t show up, I knew something was wrong,” she said. Moon went to prison for drug offenses when Cassandra was in high school, the first of several convictions. Later, between 1997 and 2000, Moon served nearly three and a half years for selling cocaine. But after he got out, Moon went to a recovery house and embraced sobriety. ”When I moved back to Commerce, I bought a house, got married and was going to church and everything,” Moon said. For the first time in nearly two decades, things were looking up for him. After moving back to his hometown, Moon started a painting business and was hired to paint a nightclub by a man he considered his friend. But the friend needed more than just a painter    he wanted help buying drugs from Moon’s old dealer. Unbeknownst to Moon, his friend was cooperating with law enforcement to avoid facing prison time for his own   offenses.  ”He was in my ear every day . .. but I still wouldn’t do it,” Moon said. Finally, in December 2004, Moon says the friend invited him over to his house and he obliged. ”He told me to come in. I went in and he had cooked up a whole bunch of crack cocaine,” Moon said.  Overwhelmed by the smell, Moon says he nearly threw up. In those fumes, his three years of sobriety, his marriage    and later, his freedom    would dissolve. He went back to using and selling drugs to support his habit. In February 2005, Moon sold crack and cocaine to an undercover agent. In April, he sold the agent several ounces of meth, and soon after, was indicted for all three deals. Allen Moye was an assistant US attorney for more than 20 years and a prosecutor on the Moon case. In his career, Moye says he worked on several drug cases where defendants were facing mandatory sentences, but that Moon’s case stood out.  ”I just don’t recall in any other case where I felt as though the punishment was so inappropriate,” Moye said. Moye recognized that because of his prior convictions, Moon was facing a mandatory minimum    life in prison without the possibility of parole    and said his team ”bent over backwards” to try to avoid that. But they needed Moon’s cooperation.  Moon says he feared for his life if he snitched on the dealers they were after, leaving the court no option but to impose the mandatory sentence. ”We had no alternative but to follow the law, but given other options, it is not the course that I would have taken,” Moye said. ’I just started crying’ Ronald Moon spent the majority of his time behind bars in   prisons, first in Kentucky and later in Louisiana, where he experienced things he thought ”only happened on TV.” Daily fights. Stabbings. Rampant drug use. Lockdowns that lasted seven months out of the year. ”I don’t want anybody to go through what I went through,” Moon said. When he was finally transferred to a   facility in South Carolina, Moon says his eyes were black from the stress. It was there that he finally got some relief. In 2014, a friend of Moon’s named Gina Smith caught wind of the Obama administration’s recently announced Clemency Initiative and offered to help. She started a petition on his behalf that garnered 1, 500 signatures before it was sent to the White House. From prison, Moon completed his own application.  For Moon, August 3, 2016, began like any other day. After lunch, he was in his cell when he was summoned to the lieutenant’s office. When he got there, prisoners were lined up in both directions taking breathalyzer tests, but Moon didn’t need to take a screening. He was pulled into an office, where the warden was seated with a printout faxed from President Obama. ”He said, ’I don’t know who you serve, but you need to start thanking them right now . .. Obama just granted you clemency,’” Moon said. ”I just started crying. I cried from there all the way back to the block.” His first call was to his brother Willie, who didn’t believe the news until Moon broke down in tears on the phone. After a few months in an Atlanta halfway house, Ronald Moon is now a free man.  An unsustainable system, Revisiting the sentences of inmates like Moon has been a second term priority for the Obama administration. According to a bipartisan task force report released earlier this year, the population in federal prisons has ballooned seven times in the past 36 years, with nearly 200, 000 incarcerated. Much of that growth is the result of mandatory minimum sentences for drug convictions, a consequence mirrored in prison costs that now consume nearly   of the overall Department of Justice budget. Many on both sides of the aisle recognize the current system is not sustainable. But those in favor of reform are anxious about how the Trump administration will respond. Trump’s attorney general nominee, Jeff Sessions, has called Obama’s clemency initiative a ”dangerous game.”  As of November 30, the Office of the Pardon Attorney    which makes recommendations to the president on clemency petitions    still has more than 13, 000 commutation petitions pending review. And while sentence reform advocates have applauded Obama’s initiative, they recognize this is not an ultimate solution.  ”Frankly, it saddens me that it’s necessary,” said Cynthia Roseberry, director of Clemency Project 2014. ”This is the only way for these folks to gain some sort of relief, and the fact that more than 36, 000 applied to us lets you know that there is some despair among those who are incarcerated    especially those who have committed nonviolent offenses.” Roseberry, whose group of lawyers and advocates assists prisoners with their applications, also points out that the initiative made inmates who had served at least 10 years a priority, likely leaving prisoners given life sentences in recent years with few options. And though they’ve been relaxed, mandatory minimums are still in place for some drug distribution and possession crimes, depending on criminal history.  ’I’m going to tell him some kind of way    thank you’ Now 60 years old, Ronald Moon recognizes that life on the outside won’t be easy. His bad knees mean that most   work will be difficult. But he’s hopeful that he can make a   comeback. Right now, his focus is on maintaining his sobriety and spending time with his grandchildren, some of whom he’s never met before.  He wants to start a recovery house of his own in the north Georgia mountains and write a book about his experience. He has been invited by the nonprofit Families Against Mandatory Minimums to share his story in front of Congress. And maybe, if he goes to Washington, he can shake the hand of the man he really wants to thank    President Obama.  ”One day, I’m going to slip up there. I’m going to find him and I’m going to tell him some kind of way    thank you. Thank you.”"
FNC’s Megyn Kelly: MSNBC’s ’Morning Joe’ ’Could Not Have Promoted Trump More’ - Breitbart,"Thursday during her “The Kelly File” program on the Fox News Channel, host Megyn Kelly pointed out that MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough and others on his “Morning Joe” show had once been very complimentary of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and have since changed their tune.  Kelly remarks were in reference to Scarborough’s claim Trump had inquired about using nuclear weapons during a foreign policy briefing. “Even MSNBC and their morning program over there, I mean, they could not have promoted Trump more,” Kelly said. “And now today, Joe Scarborough is out there talking about how three times in one meeting, [Trump] asked why he couldn’t drop a nuclear weapon. Once Trump got mad at him, he stopped saying nice things about him. ” (  The Hill) Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo"
"The Paul Ryan Project Crashes, Burns: Mr. Speaker’s Popularity Plummets As America Sees What He Really Believes - Breitbart","The tides have turned. [As House Speaker Paul Ryan’s big government, open borders agenda has been on display since he was elected to the top position in the House of Representatives in October, his polling numbers have collapsed.  New polling data from YouGov shows that Ryan’s favorability ratings have dropped nearly a quarter since he took the Speakership. “Favorable ratings of Ryan from Republicans have dropped 24 points since early November,” YouGov announced when releasing the new   polling data. Ryan’s favorability with Republican voters has dropped below 50 percent for the first time in his Speakership, as well, as he’s now fallen to just 45 percent favorability among Republicans. Of Republicans polled, he is viewed by a mere 18 percent as very favorable while 27 percent view him as somewhat favorable. Among all voters, Ryan’s favorability ratings are even lower —  just 29 percent. Among all those polled, a paltry 8 percent view Ryan as “very favorable” while just 21 percent view him as “somewhat favorable. ” Less than half —  just 45 percent, again —  of Republicans polled approve of the way Ryan is running the House of Representatives. Only 16 percent strongly approve, while 29 percent somewhat approve. Even more damning than those details is the next page of the poll, which found just 29 percent of Republicans believe Ryan is someone who “sticks to his principles, no matter what. ” A whopping 71 percent of Republicans, meanwhile, believe Ryan “compromises” on his claim that his core beliefs are conservative in order to “get things done. ” Those unbelievably awful numbers come in the wake of several phony efforts by Ryan to act like a conservative. The most egregious thing he has done as Speaker of the House is the omnibus spending bill that just passed —  costing taxpayers $1. 1 trillion and totaling more than 2, 000 pages —  a bill that funds every bit of President Obama’s efforts to fundamentally transform the United States. Afterwards, Ryan appeared on a variety of establishment right talk shows in an attempt to inaccurately claim that the omnibus bill was a victory for conservatives. But Ryan also forced through —  without allowing any amendments —  a bill that he incorrectly claimed would “pause” the refugee program in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks. The bill, from House Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Mike McCaul ( ) would actually only require three people who serve at the pleasure of the president —  the FBI director, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence —  to certify they’ve reviewed the president’s plans and agree with them. What’s truly remarkable about this whole scenario is that the political class has been building Ryan into what he is since the   when he was a lowly congressional staffer. He’s literally a creation of Washington, D. C. and the donor class, who eventually married the wealthy Janna Little, and ran for Congress in his hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin. Interestingly, Paul and Janna Ryan live in a mansion in Janesville with a giant fence around the whole property —  but Ryan didn’t think it was worth it to fund a border fence that federal law has provided for on the U. S. border with Mexico for years. He has been groomed by the power brokers of Washington and of Wall Street since he was first sent to Washington —  eventually picked in 2012 to be former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney’s running mate. They lost the election, but Ryan came back to Congress and when his predecessor John Boehner was run out of town —  ironically for doing much of what Ryan has done so far, just for longer —  the donor class turned back to Ryan to hold their political machine together one last time. And in just a couple months, the Paul Ryan project has crashed and burned. It’ll be interesting to see what happens over the next several months as 2016 progresses, and it’s unclear if Ryan will be able to regain his bearings amid this devastating lack of GOP confidence in his leadership."
MPs Give Final Approval to Brexit Bill,"The House of Commons has given its final approval to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill granting the Prime Minister the ability to begin the formal Brexit process. [MPs passed the bill by 494 to 122 after three days debating amendments.  In the end, no amendments were passed, and the bill proceeded to its third reading Wednesday evening, where MPs gave it final approval. As they voted,   MPs broke into a rendition of Beethoven’s Ode to Joy, the EU anthem, before being silenced by Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle. MPs approved the bill’s second reading last week by 498 to 114. The bill will now move to the House of Lords, which is due to begin considering it on Monday 20 February. The Upper Chamber will have a short time frame in which to debate and approve the bill, with Prime Minister Theresa May hoping to begin the Brexit process on 9 March. It remains to be seen whether   peers will try to delay or throw out the bill, something that would almost certainly trigger a constitutional crisis. Wednesday’s vote also saw a significant rebellion within the opposition Labour Party, with multiple MPs defying the party leadership to vote against Brexit. Among the rebels was Shadow Business Secretary Clive Lewis, who has duly resigned."
Intel Buys Mobileye in $15.3 Billion Bid to Lead Self-Driving Car Market - The New York Times,"In the world of driverless cars, household names like Google and Uber have raced ahead of rivals, building test vehicles and starting trials on city streets. But when it comes to what is under the hood, an array of   companies will most likely supply the technology required to bring driverless cars to the masses. And in a $15. 3 billion deal announced on Monday, Intel moved to corner the market on how much of that technology is developed. The chip maker’s acquisition of Mobileye, an Israeli company that makes sensors and cameras for driverless vehicles, is one of the largest in the   sector and sets the stage for increasing competition between Silicon Valley giants as well as traditional automakers over who will dominate the world of autonomous cars. The likes of Google and Uber have already invested billions of dollars in their own technology, signing partnerships with automakers like Chrysler and Volvo and sending test vehicles onto the road in a bid to cement their place in the industry. The sector is estimated to be worth $25 billion annually by 2025, according to Bain  Company, a consulting firm. Faced with an existential threat to its legacy computer business, Intel  —   alongside competitors like Qualcomm  —   has focused on autonomous cars as a new and potentially lucrative market. Many of these driverless vehicles, experts say, will require immense computing power, including the latest microchips able to crunch reams of data in seconds to keep the cars safe, and on the road. And by acquiring Mobileye, whose digital vision technology helps autonomous vehicles safely navigate city streets, Intel aims to broaden its offerings beyond just chips to a wider suite of products that driverless vehicles will require. It hopes, as a result, to appeal to automakers that want to offer autonomous driving but lack the   expertise and do not want to rely on the likes of Google. “Scale is going to win in this market,” Brian Krzanich, Intel’s chief executive, told investors on Monday. “I don’t believe that every carmaker can invest to do independent development into autonomous cars. ” Intel has a history with such strategic moves. It cornered the personal computer market over more than three decades, supplying hundreds of millions of desktop computers with much of their internal architecture, after dominating which microchips were used in the industry. But in recent years, Intel has struggled to find its feet as people’s habits have increasingly turned to the mobile world, where the company’s chips have lost out to rivals. Last year, for instance, the company announced that it was laying off 12, 000 people, or 11 percent of its global work force, as demand for personal computers continued to decline. While Intel still earns more than half of its annual revenue from traditional computing   operations, the company’s sales from its “internet of things” division, a unit that includes its burgeoning automaking team, grew 15 percent in 2016, to $2. 6 billion, according to regulatory filings. Over the last 18 months, Intel has signed partnership deals with BMW and Delphi Automotive, an auto parts supplier, to expand its presence in the field. It also acquired a 15 percent stake in Here, a digital mapping business owned by a consortium of German automakers, and announced last year that it would invest $250 million in   working on driverless car technologies. Mobileye, founded in Jerusalem in 1999, has signed deals with several automakers, including Audi, for the use of its vision and camera technology, which uses machine learning and complex neuroscience to help drivers  —   and increasingly cars themselves  —   avoid obstacles on the road. It also has longstanding ties with Intel. The chip maker was a partner with Mobileye and BMW last year over efforts to bring autonomous cars to city streets by 2021. In January, the companies announced plans to have up to 40 autonomous cars on American and European roads by the end of this year as part of initial trials. As that collaboration grew, Intel and Mobileye executives began talking about a potential takeover at the end of December, holding meetings, mostly in New York, to complete a deal in which Mobileye’s executives would take the lead in new expanded efforts. “This deal makes Intel a Tier 1 partner for the automotive industry,” said Martin Birkner, an automotive analyst at Gartner, a technology research company in Munich. “As the industry moves toward autonomous driving, new types of digital suppliers like Intel are developing quickly. ” Intel’s efforts to stamp a claim on driverless cars represents a recognition that   rivals like Nvidia and Qualcomm had moved slightly ahead in the race to provide the computing power needed for autonomous vehicles. As part of the deal, Intel said it would buy Mobileye’s outstanding shares at $63. 54 a share, a 34 percent premium to Mobileye’s closing price on Friday. The acquisition requires shareholder and regulatory approval, and is expected to close by the end of this year. Much of Intel’s success will depend on Amnon Shashua, Mobileye’s   and chief technology officer, who has a doctorate in brain and cognitive sciences from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Part of Mr. Shashua’s plan is to have cars with Mobileye’s advanced driver assist systems collect imaging and location data that can be used to create what the company calls RoadBook  —   a vast digital map of roadways in the United States and Europe. The goal, Mr. Shashua said, is to provide carmakers with a complete product line of digital services that go beyond what they can do for themselves. “The collaboration that we want to do can’t happen if we are two different organizations,” he said on Monday. “The collaboration already runs deep. ” Still, experts say autonomous cars are unlikely to hit the roads by the end of the decade, at the earliest, because regulators are beginning to question which rules such cars should follow and because of struggles to make the technology work seamlessly. Uber, the   service, halted its driverless car tests in California after local officials said the company did not have the required permits, though its tests in Pittsburgh are continuing. Google’s own efforts ran into difficulties after the company’s driverless cars were involved in a spate of collisions. And in Europe, regulators are divided on the issue of   cars, causing the automotive industry to complain that the delays could hamper plans to take the technology to the streets there. Still, with technology companies and global automakers making hefty  —   and costly  —   bets on autonomous cars, experts that say more deals like Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye are likely to follow as firms jostle for position. More acquisitions, said Mr. Birkner of Gartner, “are an absolute necessity. ” “Carmakers and Silicon Valley companies,” he said, “are realizing that they both bring different skills to the table. ”"
"Texas Cop, Wife Shoot Muggers at Gas Station","A Texas sheriff’s deputy and his wife opened fire on two black males after they assaulted the   officer at a gas station. [The deputy was in plain clothes at the time and had a four wheeler hitched to his truck. He and his wife were headed to their deer lease, according to the Montgomery County Police Reporter.  The reported attack occurred after the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office deputy walked out of a Shell Station at Sorters and Summer Hills roads in Montgomery County, Texas. The two black males allegedly assaulted him, taking him to the ground and started kicking him in the head. The suspects were apparently trying to rob the officer because they tried to get his wallet. The deputy’s wife was armed and she exited the vehicle and discharged several shots at the suspects as they were running towards a red Chevrolet truck. The deputy went to get his pistol and also opened fire.  Engle reported that the red truck was recovered by Houston Police Department officers in northeast Houston. The truck had been carjacked a few days earlier while the owner was still in it. Law enforcement officials with the Montgomery County crime lab have the truck and are combing it for fingerprints and DNA samples. The deputy was taken to the hospital and later released. He has lacerations to his face, a broken jaw, and several missing teeth, reported the Police Reporter. He will undergo corrective surgery in the near future. The suspects remain at large but anyone with information about their whereabouts or witnessed the incident has been asked to call the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office.

"Globally, Orlando Attack Strikes Now-Familiar Fault Lines - The New York Times","ROME  —   By Monday morning, the grim, if now familiar, global ritual had begun. Leaders across Europe, Asia and elsewhere sent messages of sympathy and outrage. Editorialists opined against extremism and violence. Symbolic gestures  —   another special lighting of the Eiffel Tower  —   were announced. Solidarity hashtags circled the virtual globe. The Orlando attack now ranks as the deadliest mass shooting in United States history. And the horrific slaughter early Sunday at a gay nightclub has a uniquely American component, again demonstrating an easy access to assault weapons that stupefies much of the rest of the world. But judging from the initial reaction, the attack in Florida resonated globally on Monday not as an American anomaly, but because it felt so universal. Orlando now takes a place with Paris, Brussels, Beirut, Bamako, San Bernardino and other cities struck by different incarnations of terrorism in recent years. Candles were once lit in their honor, too. The Orlando attack is already stirring debate on some of the most visceral fault lines of American politics: terrorism and Islamophobia, security and civil liberties, gun control and gay rights. But absent guns, those issues also resonate across the world, especially in many developed countries wrestling with how to maintain their freedoms in the face of violent attacks on their values. In an interconnected world, what seemed most relevant was what bound together the satirists of Charlie Hebdo, the rock music fans at the Bataclan, the tourists at the Brussels airport and the young people dancing early Sunday at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando  —   not what divided them and their societies. But that connectedness also meant that Orlando quickly became politicized globally as well as in the United States. One organization campaigning for Britain to leave the European Union in the June 23 national referendum posted a campaign message on Twitter that showed Islamic State fighters warning of an “  atrocity” if Britain remained in the European bloc. The group deleted the message after the person who posted it was widely condemned. For many gays, lesbians and transgender people, the Orlando attack was a searing moment, highlighting the continued threats they face from an ideologically varied array of sources even as much of the world grows more inclusive about sexuality. In London, Owen Jones, a liberal columnist who is gay, walked off the set of a Sky News program after arguing with the host on how the Orlando attack should be defined. Mr. Jones argued it was both a terrorist attack and an   hate crime, while the program’s host sought to make a distinction between the two. “This guy, however he dresses up his bigotry and hatred, is someone who hates gays,” Mr. Jones said of the killer. “If he went into a synagogue and killed innocent Jewish people, as people have done, disgusting   terrorists, we’d call it out for what it is. “This was a homophobic hate crime as well as terrorism. ” The day before the Orlando attack, thousands of people took part in gay pride parades in Croatia and Poland amid concerns about rising   political trends. In Brazil, a spate of killings of gay and transgender people has started an intense debate, with some Brazilians arguing that the rising clout of evangelical Christian legislators is increasing intolerance in the country. “These killings in Orlando were motivated by the most sordid homophobia,” said Jean Wyllys, an openly gay congressman from Rio de Janeiro. “This could have happened to any of us, to me, to a friend, a work colleague, a neighbor, a cousin. They could be dead if they had been in Orlando enjoying themselves at a club without harming anyone else. ” Europe’s mainstream political leaders were quick to offer condolences on Monday and affirm their friendship with the American people. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany condemned “such a murderous attack” and declared a determination to “continue our open, tolerant life. ” Tel Aviv’s City Hall was bathed in the colors of the rainbow and the American flag on Sunday night. The town hall in Sydney, Australia, was lit in pink. In Britain, the cities of Blackpool and Liverpool said they would light local landmarks with rainbow colors on Monday night in memory of the victims. Even so, the Orlando killings come as   political parties in Europe are stoking     sentiments in a similar vein to Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in the United States. As Mr. Trump quickly seized on the massacre to renew his call to view Muslim immigrants as a threat, some politicians in the European right did the same. Hungary’s   government has been in the vanguard on resisting migrants, and championing a   illiberal democracy. On Monday, Lajos Kosa, the parliamentary leader of the governing party, invoked the Orlando attacks as a cudgel to repeat the party’s campaign against migrants from Syria and other Muslim nations. “Uncontrolled migration, forced resettlement, the inflow of crowds into European society who not only cannot but do not want to integrate come with enormous dangers,” Mr. Kosa told a plenary session of the Hungarian Parliament on Monday. In recent years, as Europe has struggled to respond to Islamist terrorism, security in the United States was regarded as more efficient and better organized. Europe’s national security agencies were poorly coordinated and blamed for failing to root out cells of homegrown Islamist terrorists, especially in France and Belgium. Now, after the attacks in Orlando and San Bernardino, Calif. the United States also seems likely to confront difficult questions about the government’s ability to track and stop determined killers, especially those who operate largely on their own, drawing inspiration but not practical support from groups like the Islamic State. The questions are likely to be especially pointed for the F. B. I. given that it had twice investigated the Orlando killer, Omar Mateen, for possible terrorist ties. For years, America’s liberal gun laws, and the unwillingness of Congress to change them, have mystified people in many other countries. In Japan, the American gun issue is treated as a bizarre aberration, and much of the news media coverage of the Orlando killings focused on the terrorism angle. Only one person was killed by a gun last year in Japan, according to the National Police Agency, and there were only eight reported incidents of a gun being fired. In China, news of the Orlando shooting came only hours after a man set off primitive explosives in the   area at an airport in Shanghai. Four people were slightly injured, showing the gulf between the two countries in the lethality of the weapons available to the public. In China, where ordinary citizens have no access to firearms, the weapon of choice is often a large kitchen knife. More than 300, 000 Chinese students are studying at American universities, and the Orlando shooting brought on new concerns from Chinese parents. Gao Junlan, a lawyer from southwestern China’s Sichuan Province, was concerned about her daughter, a   chemistry student at the University of Minnesota. Her daughter was at the Shanghai airport when the explosives were detonated there, waiting to catch a flight to the United States. “I think the American government should tighten its gun control,” Ms. Gao said by telephone. “Yes, it is a free society for people with all religions and beliefs, but not everyone is capable of controlling their behavior, and the government’s lax regulation is making killing a lot easier. ”"
Blue State Blues: Top 10 Biblical Kings - Breitbart,"It’s the heavy campaign season, and candidates  —   the Republicans, anyway  —   are keen to show they care about the Bible as much as, if not more than, any other American. Republican frontrunner Donald Trump was criticized over his reference to “Two Corinthians,” as well as his professed favorite verse, a passage from Proverbs about envy. [Here’s a good political verse  —   1 Kings 20:11: “And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off. ” In other words: don’t boast as if you have already won something. That message, delivered from King Ahab to the evil Aramean king   is one of the best “trash talk” lines in the entire Bible, and one of the only positive contributions of one of the Bible’s most wicked kings.  Aside from crisp rebukes like that, the Book of Kings contains many stories about leadership  —   and leadership failures. There are 40 kings in all, most of them bad. But ten, including some perhaps unfamiliar ones, stand out. 1. David  —   The builder of empire and composer of Psalms, David established Jerusalem as his capital and unified the tribes. Despite grave sins, including adultery and murder, he is remembered as the best king because he was quick to acknowledge guilt and repent. He served the Lord with a “complete heart,” never doubting His authority. 2. Hezekiah  —   The greatest king of Judah  —   the southern kingdom  —   withstood a siege by an Assyrian army that had just exiled the northern kingdom of Israel. He relied on  faith to withstand the enemy, and turned to God again when he fell gravely ill  —   though he erred by showing Babylonian emissaries the Temple, which they would later plunder. 3. Jehoshaphat  —   A Judean king obsessed with repairing relations with Israel, Jehoshaphat’s record in war and trade was mixed. However, he conducted an ambitious program of domestic reform, removing most idolatry and sending teachers throughout the land. Not content with reforming the provinces, he cleaned up corruption in Jerusalem, too. 4. Josiah  —   The last good king of Judah, Josiah launches the most ambitious reform in centuries after   the warnings of Deuteronomy that the price of disobeying God will be exile. For his trouble, he is spared personally from having to witness the destruction of the Judean kingdom  —   though he eventually meets a violent end at war. 5. Jotham  —   The only king entirely free of sin, Jotham takes over his father Uzziah’s responsibilities (see below) and notches several military successes. His son Ahaz, however, goes on to be the worst king of Judah. 6. Uzziah  —   The longest reign  —   over five decades  —   belongs to Uzziah, who set an example of moral leadership and improved the kingdom’s defenses. However, he oversteps the bounds of his office  —   violating an early version of the separation of powers  —   by trying to usurp the priests’ role in the Temple, and is struck with a form of leprosy. 7. Solomon  —   Traditionally thought of as one of the greatest of kings, Solomon’s early achievements, including the building of the Holy Temple, are almost negated by his later sins. Though wise, he indulges his appetites with hundreds of wives and concubines, some of whom are foreign and eventually lead him astray into idolatry. 8. Asa  —   He reverses generations of   decline, and rids the kingdom  —   including his own family  —   of idolatry. However, he sets a bad precedent by bribing a foreign leader to attack Israel, and turns away from God. 9. Jehoash  —   After surviving the attempt by wicked Queen Athaliah to kill every last member of the Davidic line, Jehoash is installed by the priests as king in a daring coup. He reforms the kingdom, particularly the system of financial contributions for maintaining the Temple. Later, however, he defiled the Temple by murdering a priest. 10. Amaziah  —   Another miraculous survivor after the assassination of his father, Amaziah has to fight to consolidate his power, and then to defend the kingdom. Initial success in war, however, leads him down a brazen path  —   from murdering a captured enemy army to an   attack on Israel that results in the sacking of Jerusalem."
"Police One: Conditioning Britons to ’Run, Hide, Tell’ Does Not Demonstrate Resolve","In the wake of the June 3 London Bridge attacks, Police One warns that conditioning Britons to “run, hide, tell” does not demonstrate resolve. [Instead they show that the tactic reveals “an aversion to the use of force in   [which] may embolden  …     terrorists. ”  Police One praises the Brits who did what they could to buy time by throwing drink glasses, bar stools, etc. at the London attackers. The response was not without demonstrations of courage. But the overarching mindset of “run, hide, tell”  instead of “Move! Escape or Attack!” betrays a conditioning that seeks a means of retreat instead of a means of counteraction it is a response from a position of weakness instead of a position of strength. Police One quotes Winston Churchill’s 1940 address to the House of Commons: We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills we shall never surrender. But the word “fight” does not appear to be in the lexicon of those behind 21st century social and psychological conditioning in Britain.  And this is tragic because some people will be forced to fight for their lives. Police One explains, “Yet, in the end, there may be no other alternative for the public but to fight. Running and hiding may work, depending on the circumstances and a person’s proximity to the epicenter of an attack, but for some people, there will be no suitable alternative but fighting. ” The lack of emphasis on “fighting” is part of a paradigm that impacts the Metropolitan Police as well. After all, “the majority of British police officers are not trusted with lethal force tools and the officers who are actually equipped with firearms operate in a culture where their use is highly discouraged by authorities. ” So it comes as not surprise that one of the officers near the June 3 terror attacks had only a “club” for both an offensive and defensive tool. Police One asks, “Is it possible that the British are emboldening these attackers by failing to demonstrate their resolve and their commitment to confronting evil with force?” They suggest Churchill would answer in the affirmative.

Measles outbreak surging in Italy," (CNN) An outbreak of measles is spreading across Italy, with more than 1, 600 cases of the disease reported in 2017, across 19 of the country’s 21 regions. The number of cases seen so far this year is already higher than the total number of cases seen during all of 2016, according to the European Centers for Disease Control. The outbreak adds to concern among European health officials who have been monitoring an ongoing outbreak in Romania, where almost 4, 800 cases have been reported since the start of 2016. The country has also seen 21 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. ”Italy is one of two main countries affected across the (European) region at the moment,” said Dr. Robb Butler, Program Manager of the   Diseases and Immunization Program of the WHO Regional Office for Europe. The United Stated Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has now issued recommendations for anyone traveling to Italy to ensure they are vaccinated against measles. Recommendations for travel to Romania have been in place since 2016.  The Americas were declared   in 2016, something the European region of WHO is still working towards. Almost 40% of cases in Italy were admitted into hospital and the median age of those affected was 27 years, according to the country’s Ministry of Health.  The European Center for Disease Control state most cases were in patients older than 15 years of age, meaning babies and young children are not the ones becoming infected but instead people who failed to be vaccinated as children. ”Italy has had suboptimal coverage for many years now,” said Butler, adding that vaccine coverage for measles has fallen every year since 2012. The country saw a large outbreak in 2014, when 4, 350 people were infected. Of the 1, 603 cases reported this year, as of April 16, 88% are known to be unvaccinated. More than 95% of the population need to be vaccinated for the measles virus not to persist within a population, known as the herd immunity threshold. In 2015, WHO data shows coverage in Italy at 83% for those who received a second dose of a measles vaccine.  Some regions within Italy are as low as 70% said Butler. Butler believes the fall in confidence towards vaccines is fueled by both a rise in the   movement across Europe as well as complacency towards the disease, with some not receiving vaccinations due to lack of concern about the risk of contracting measles.  ”Parents are under the impression measles cases have been consigned to history,” he said. ”Until they see an outbreak.” But he is more worried about the increasing refusal of the vaccine by people fearing adverse effects, which stems as far back as the MMR scare ignited by a now discredited and retracted paper published by UK scientist Andrew Wakefield. ”We have seen vaccine refusal increasing,” said Butler. ”Our advise is clear: everyone should be vaccinated,” he said. While negative attitudes are also playing a role in Romania’s ongoing epidemic, experts add the country’s health system, and it’s inability to reach everyone in the population has an equally crucial part to play in the outbreak. ”Vaccines are in good supply . .. but a large percentage of the population are hard to reach,” said Butler. Officials in Romania, however, are currently reporting temporary supply issues for measles containing vaccines which have slightly stalled their response. There are 630, 000 registered Roma in Romania and many more unregistered that are   by the system and need particular attention, said Butler. ”There’s a convergence of these different concerns,” said Heidi Larson, Director of the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine. ”But the main issue is safety anxieties.” Falling confidence, rising infections, In 2016, Larson led a study exploring the state of vaccine confidence across 67 countries worldwide in which people were asked four simple questions: whether vaccines were important, safe, effective and compatible with their religious beliefs. ”(Italy) was the second worst in the world, second only to France,” in terms of negativity towards vaccines, said Larson.  Approximately 20% of those surveyed in Italy (20. 6%) and Romania (19. 8%) disagreed with the statement that vaccines were safe. In France, more than 40% disagreed, while the global average was 13% said Larson. France has also experienced a measles outbreak this year. ”Measles is the first thing you will see after   said Larson. ”Because it’s so highly infectious.” Larson fears that   in positions of power will further aid these outbreaks by increasing uncertainty and anxiety among populations and feels that those in support of vaccines now need to be more vocal, like their opposition. ”We shouldn’t ignore it,” she said, adding that health professionals and public health officials should have conversations with people and not be dismissive of their concerns. Dr. Andrea Ammon, European Centers for Disease Control acting director, said: ”It is worrying to see the accumulation of unvaccinated individuals and as a consequence outbreaks of measles in several European countries,  particularly considering the availability of a highly effective and safe vaccine against the disease.” What’s being done, Health officials within Italian and Romanian departments of health as well as the WHO and European Centers for Disease Control are working to control the current outbreaks. ”Opportunities for the identification of unvaccinated individuals and   vaccination need to be reinforced,” said Ammon. ”Closing immunisation gaps in adolescents and adults who did not receive vaccination in the past, as well as strengthening routine childhood immunisation programmes, are vital to prevent future outbreaks and ensure adequate levels of protection.” In Romania,   vaccination campaigns are underway to reach those who remain unvaccinated. ”These are driving people towards immunization sites,” said Butler. In Italy, national vaccination campaigns are not underway but there is national support to increase investment and communication of the importance of getting vaccinated to protect populations. ”They need to reach underperforming regions,” said Butler. While confident that the increased investment and campaigns in Romania are a step in the right direction to control that country’s outbreak, Butler admits controlling the epidemic in Italy is a ”tough job.” ”We are in a very vulnerable place,” added Larson, believing officials must not drop the ball on public confidence. ”If we resist and say this is still fringe, we risk losing.”"
El Paso HS Nixes Legendary Coach Lou Holtz as Guest Speaker for Immigration Comments,"El Paso’s Cathedral High School disinvited legendary NCAA football coach Lou Holtz as their   gala guest speaker for describing immigration as an invasion and opining that immigrants need to learn how to assimilate better. [Inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2008, the    icon served as the head coach for six NCAA football teams including Notre Dame and the University of South Carolina, compiling a career record of 249 —  132 —  7.  Last Month at the Republican National Convention, during a luncheon celebrating the GOP nomination of real estate mogul Donald Trump, Holtz referring to immigrants remarked:“I don’t want to speak your language, I don’t want to celebrate your holidays, I sure as hell don’t want to cheer for your soccer team. ” According to the El Paso Times, Holtz confessed, subsequently, that he wishes he never made the comment. Wednesday the president of the Council of Presidents at Cathedral, David Saucedo, confirmed in an email that the beloved coach and TV football analyst would not be speaking at the October 20 school gala and fundraiser. Luis Villalobos, a 1963 graduate of Cathedral High School, claims that the alumni did the “right and courageous thing” by reversing their August 18th decision to invite Holtz. In a letter to the editor of the El Paso Times, he wrote: “Public figures have to know, even during this election time, their words have consequences. They can speak before a very enthusiastic crowd, but they can’t say things that are insulting to any group, whether it be a minority group, women or whatever group they are railing against. ” Villalobos believes that the   winner of the Paul “Bear” Bryant Award took the “wrong road” when he made the comments about immigrants.  “Imagine the impact the coach’s words would have had if he had spoken about inclusion or if he would have spoken about being merciful and accepting of all people in this country and instead of dividing, uniting people? His comments would have been incredibly impactful,” Villalobos opined. An editorial by the El Paso Times applied pressure on the Cathedral alumni when it stated that the high school’s leaders “made an unfortunate decision” by picking Holtz to speak at the gathering geared to raise funds for future scholarships. “Holtz is a highly successful football coach, but his hateful words last month run counter to many of the principles that have made Cathedral such an important part of the El Paso community,” the paper stated.  Tuesday, the day before he rescinded the invite to Coach Holtz to share his words of wisdom at the fundraiser, President Saucedo expressed a different point of view in a letter to the Times: “[T]he negative, vitriolic response to Coach Holtz from some in our community has been shocking and is, equally, unbecoming. ” He added, “It’s difficult to persuade, or at least attempt, to change one’s mind on immigration if you immediately shun them. We love the concept of free speech, up until there is disagreement, then we are quick to slander and smear those individuals. ”"
Poll: 83 Percent Say Hillary Clinton Guilty of Illegal or Unethical Acts - Breitbart,"A new   national poll shows Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump by one point  —   and over half of likely voters saying they believe she has broken the law. [From McClatchy DC:  WASHINGTON —  A majority of voters believe Hillary Clinton has done something illegal, according to a new   Poll days before the presidential election. A total of 83 percent of likely voters believe that Clinton did something wrong  —   51 percent saying she did something illegal and 32 percent saying she something unethical but not illegal. Just 14 percent said she’s done nothing wrong. By comparison, 79 percent think Donald Trump did something wrong, though not nearly as many think he did something illegal. Just 26 percent think he’s done something illegal, while 53 percent think he’s dome something unethical but not illegal. Just 17 percent think he’s done nothing wrong. The deep suspicion of Clinton is likely a top reason she’s lost much of her lead and the race for the White House has tightened in the race’s closing days. In a   race, the two are neck and neck with Clinton supported by 44 percent and Trump by 43 percent. Libertarian Gary Johnson has 6 percent, and the Green Party’s Jill Stein has 2 percent. In a   match up, Clinton has 46 percent, Trump 44 percent. Read the rest of the story here."
Rapper Rick Ross’s Ankle Monitor Goes Off During Minorty Youth Empowerment Program at White House - Breitbart,"Rapper Rick Ross visited the White House on Friday as an ambassador for President Obama’s black and Latino youth program  —   and his   ankle monitor reportedly went off shortly after the president concluded a speech. [According to the Associated Press, the “Hood Billionaire” rapper joined fellow artists Alicia Keys, Common, Nicki Minaj, Busta Rhymes, Janelle Monae, Ludacris, Chance the Rapper and others at the White House on Friday, where the group met with the president to discuss the administration’s “My Brother’s Keeper” initiative, which focuses on empowering black and Latino youth.  But according to TMZ, Ross’s ankle monitor, which he must wear as a condition of his release on kidnapping and assault charges last summer, beeped loudly shortly after the president concluded a speech. Ross was arrested in June 2015 on kidnapping, aggravated assault and aggravated battery charges after allegedly   a man who had been doing repair work on his house. The kidnapping charge was added after it was alleged that the man was physically prevented from leaving Ross’ house. Obama has previously enlisted the help of the music industry to promote the”My Brother’s Keeper” initiative, which aims to provide access to higher education to black and Latino youth. In January, Obama met with rapper Kendrick Lamar in the Oval Office, where the two discussed problems facing inner city youth and the importance of mentorship programs. WATCH: Keys has also been an outspoken advocate for criminal justice reform. In February, the   singer sent Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan a steamy Valentine’s Day message urging him to allow a vote on criminal justice reform legislation in the current session of Congress. The parents of the late Trayvon Martin, who straddled neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman and repeatedly bashed his head against concrete before Zimmerman shot him in   helped Obama kick off the “My Brother’s Keeper” program in 2014.

"You’re an Adult. Your Brain, Not So Much. - The New York Times","Leah H. Somerville, a Harvard neuroscientist, sometimes finds herself in front of an audience of judges. They come to hear her speak about how the brain develops. It’s a subject on which many legal questions depend. How old does someone have to be to be sentenced to death? When should someone get to vote? Can an    give informed consent? Scientists like Dr. Somerville have learned a great deal in recent years. But the complex picture that’s emerging lacks the bright lines that policy makers would like. “Oftentimes, the very first question I get at the end of a presentation is, ‘O. K. that’s all very nice, but when is the brain finished? When is it done developing? ’” Dr. Somerville said. “And I give a very nonsatisfying answer. ” Dr. Somerville laid out the conundrum in detail in a commentary published on Wednesday in the journal Neuron. The human brain reaches its adult volume by age 10, but the neurons that make it up continue to change for years after that. The connections between neighboring neurons get pruned back, as new links emerge between more widely separated areas of the brain. Eventually this reshaping slows, a sign that the brain is maturing. But it happens at different rates in different parts of the brain. The pruning in the occipital lobe, at the back of the brain, tapers off by age 20. In the frontal lobe, in the front of the brain, new links are still forming at age 30, if not beyond. “It challenges the notion of what ‘done’ really means,” Dr. Somerville said. As the anatomy of the brain changes, its activity changes as well. In a child’s brain, neighboring regions tend to work together. By adulthood, distant regions start acting in concert. Neuroscientists have speculated that this   harmony lets the adult brain work more efficiently and process more information. But the development of these networks is still mysterious, and it’s not yet clear how they influence behavior. Some children, researchers have found, have neural networks that look as if they belong to an adult. But they’re still just children. Dr. Somerville’s own research focuses on how the changes in the maturing brain affect how people think. Adolescents do about as well as adults on cognition tests, for instance. But if they’re feeling strong emotions, those scores can plummet. The problem seems to be that teenagers have not yet developed a strong brain system that keeps emotions under control. That system may take a surprisingly long time to mature, according to a study published this year in Psychological Science. The authors asked a group of   to    to lie in an fMRI scanner and look at a monitor. They were instructed to press a button each time they were shown faces with a certain expression on them  —   happy in some trials, scared or neutral in others. And in some cases, the participants knew that they might hear a loud, jarring noise at the end of the trial. In the trials without the noise, the subjects did just as well as people in their  . But when they were expecting the noise, they did worse on the test. Brain scans revealed that the regions of their brains in which emotion is processed were unusually active, while areas dedicated to keeping those emotions under control were weak. “The young adults looked like teenagers,” said Laurence Steinberg, a psychologist at Temple University and an author of the study. Dr. Steinberg agreed with Dr. Somerville that the maturing of the brain was proving to be a long, complicated process without obvious milestones. Nevertheless, he thinks recent studies hold some important lessons for policy makers. He has proposed, for example, that the voting age be lowered to 16. “   are just as good at logical reasoning as older people are,” Dr. Steinberg said. Courts, too, may need to take into account the powerful influence of emotions, even on people in their early 20s. “Most crime situations that young people are involved in are emotionally arousing situations  —   they’re scared, or they’re angry, intoxicated or whatever,” Dr. Steinberg said. Dr. Somerville, on the other hand, said she was reluctant to offer specific policy suggestions based on her brain research. “I’m still in the learning stage, so I’d hesitate to call out any particular thing,” she said. But she does think it is important for the scientists to get a fuller picture of how the brain matures. Researchers need to do   studies to track its development from year to year, she said, well into the 20s or beyond. It’s not enough to compare people using simple categories, such as labeling people below age 18 as children and those older as adults. “Nothing magical occurs at that age,” Dr. Somerville said."
Baby born in rescue chopper after Peru flooding," (CNN) After weeks of steady rain, a ray of sunlight: A woman gave birth to a healthy baby girl inside a rescue helicopter as she was being lifted from a flooded village in northern Peru, the Peruvian Army said.  Maria Josefa Pingo Sanchez, 20, was rescued on Tuesday afternoon, and her baby girl came into the world about 3:50 p. m. 15 minutes before the helicopter touched down at a hospital.   The baby was named Cielo, ”sky” in Spanish, according to   news channel TV Peru.  Mother and baby were lucky. The floods in Peru have claimed the lives of 106 people, government news agency Andina reported. Overall, more than a million people have been affected by the floods: Those include more than 361, 981 children and 20, 659 pregnant women.  Floods, mudslides hit Peru, Tenant Col. EP Edward Albuquerque Cordova, who rescued Pingo, said in a video released by the Peruvian Army that she had already been in labor for two days.   In the video, we see a towel draped over Pingo’s knees and belly, and what looks like an army medic helping her through contractions.   ”It was time. She wanted to be born midair,” Pingo told Peruvian media at the hospital, grinning.    ”She was in a precarious state of health,” Albuquerque said, adding that the rescuers were not expecting Pingo to give birth before getting to a hospital, and that the birth was ”improvised,” but  the baby’s arrival brought joy to everyone in his crew.   ”It was the first time this happened to me, and the first time it happened in an army helicopter, and in the army in general,” Albuquerque said.  Peru flooding: How to help, Pingo gave birth about 15 minutes before the helicopter reached its destination, a hospital in Chiclayo.   ”What do we want the baby to be? A pilot, a soldier, or a commander? In any way, she is now a part of our family,” Albuquerque said, smiling widely.   Mother and baby are doing well and on Thursday received a visit from the rescue unit’s commander, Col. Javier Tryon, who brought her a gift. Pingo was so thankful to the Peruvian air force that she asked the unit commander to be baby Cielo’s godfather,   TV Peru reported. Tryon said that it’s the army’s commitment to keep helping the Peruvian people.  Peru’s Ministry of Foreign Trade and Tourism tweeted a photo of mother and daughter taken just minutes after the birth, with the caption ”This is how hope is born.”"
Senate passes ’fast track’ trade promotion bill,"Washington (CNN) After weeks of tense negotiations on Capitol Hill and heavy lobbying from the White House, the Senate Friday night cleared a major trade bill that is a top priority of President Barack Obama.   The Trade Promotion Authority bill passed 62 to 37, with the support of 14 Democrats and most Republicans.  The bill now goes to the House, where opposition from Democrats and some Republicans is stiff and the bill’s outlook is uncertain. Action there is expected next month. The legislation would give Congress the ability to vote for or against    but not amend or filibuster    major international trade agreements negotiated by the White House. It’s known as ”fast track” authority because it is designed to speed up and boost the likelihood of the U. S. approving free trade agreements. The pending     Partnership isn’t expected to be sealed until and if Congress clears the   bill. RELATED: 6 reasons why the   Partnership matters, ”Today’s bipartisan Senate vote is an important step toward ensuring the United States can negotiate and enforce strong,   trade agreements,” Obama said in a statement issued by the White House. ”If done right, these agreements are vital to expanding opportunities for the middle class, leveling the playing field for American workers, and establishing rules for the global economy that help our businesses grow and hire by selling goods made in America to the rest of the world.” Many Democrats    led by liberal senators Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts    warned the bill would lead to American jobs moving overseas, where wages and worker protections are not as strong.  ”We’ve seen the devastating cost of bad trade deals over the years so we know that fast track trade promotion authority is not the way to ensure that the American public receives the full and thorough debate on the vast implications of the   Partnership,” the   said in a statement this week. Before the bill was approved, supporters narrowly beat back a bipartisan amendment from Sen. Rob Portman,   and Sen. Debbie Stabenow,   that would have required new currency manipulation standards be part of future trade bills. The White House worked vigorously against the amendment, saying it would cripple the   Partnership talks because of opposition from other countries. The amendment failed,  ."
"Former Cowboy Tony Romo: Now Lining Up Behind the Golf Ball, Fails in US Open Bid - Breitbart","Former NFL quarterback Tony Romo will be on his couch watching the U. S. Open next month along with millions of other golf fans, after failing to qualify for America’s most prestigious golf championship by shooting a   par 75, six strokes above the cut line. [The pride of the Dallas Cowboys didn’t even come close. Romo tied for 40th place out of 107 entrants in a regional qualifier at Split Rail Links and Golf Club in Aledo, Texas.   The        passer, joined about 9500 other golfers in their bid to    at Erin Hills, the site of the 2017 U. S. Open to be played June   in Wisconsin. It is the first time the tournament will be played at the gorgeous and demanding venue, and a first time for the state of Wisconsin to hold the Open. The golfers will be weaned down to about 70 players when the tournament commences. Romo has long prided himself on his golf, and plays to about a plus 3. 3 handicap, which is competitive with the majority of professional golfers. In 2009, Golf Digest ranked Romo as the number one golfer of professional athletes who doesn’t make their living playing golf. Nevertheless, it appears his game needs a bit of work if he plans on going pro. Jordan Spieth, a good friend of Romo’s, in 2015 claimed he was spotting the     a side and stuffing his wallet with Romo’s cash. In 2015 when sports commentator Jim Rome asked the 2015 U. S. Open winner how much he’s won from Romo, Spieth remarked: “I don’t know. I can’t even count that high. He’s a good friend and a great competitor so we have fun out there. ” Romo wouldn’t be the first NFL quarterback to join the ranks of professional golfers if he were to sharpen his skills enough to qualify as a professional tour player. Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback and 1970 NFL MVP, John Brodie, played on the Champions Tour from  . Brodie, who once threw for 30 touchdowns in one season, won the 1991 Security Pacific Senior Classic and captured 12   finishes during his golfing campaign. Brodie once said about the sport that many ridicule as not really being a sport, but a game:  Some critics claim golf is only a walk in the park and cannot be called an athletic event  …    . I think golf is the most demanding sport of them all in asking coordination from mind and body. It involves more qualities than any other game. Football is repetition. After many hours of work with teammates, you react by reflex and instinct. There are so many factors depending on more than one person.   …     I learned a lot on the tour. Possibly most important, I learned a lot about myself. NBC Sports reported that in 2010 Romo made it to the sectional qualifying, but had to pull out due to his obligations with the Cowboys. Also, in 2005 he qualified as an alternate for sectional qualifying. "
Malcolm Turnbull and Donald Trump met for just 30 minutes in New York,"’  ’ ’   Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who flew halfway   around the world to meet with Donald Trump today, had his New   York meeting with the US president cut to just 30 minutes after   Trump stayed in Washington to celebrate Republicans finally   winning the House vote to replace ”Obamacare.” ’ ’   The pair met in dinner suits aboard the decommissioned USS   Intrepid, which is now a museum, ahead of the pair speaking at a   gala dinner to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the battle of   the Coral Sea on the ship. ’ ’   Trump flew to New York, his home town, for the first time since   he became president to meet with Turnbull    in a move   some interpret as an attempt to repair the damage caused by a   fractious phone call between the pair in the early days of   Trump’s presidency. ’ ’   But the US president called any suggestions of conflict over the   call a ”a bit of fake news.” ’ ’   ”You guys exaggerated that call,” Trump said. ”I mean, we’re not   babies.

Politico: Donald Trump Is The ’American Silvio Berlusconi’,"As the U. S. presidential primaries rage on and Donald Trump holds onto a healthy lead in the Republican showdown, Politico has drawn a parallel between the American magnate and Italy’s resilient but often embarrassing populist leader, Silvio Berlusconi. [Politico writer Silvia Marchetti claims that on observing Trump’s rise, Italians experience a “queasy sense of déjà vu,” hearing “very familiar echoes in Trump’s   rhetoric, his opulent machismo and the cult of personality based on the image of the   man. ”  Similar comparisons have appeared recently in the Italian press, who find numerous similarities between the entrepreneurs, suggesting that an excellence in   and consumer persuasion do not always translate into effective policy or leadership. Il Fatto Quotidiano, an influential daily, said that like Berlusconi, Trump presents “a threat to democracy because he’s not a politician, but a brand —  a parasite that destroys the political establishment through   and techniques. ” Silvio Berlusconi enjoyed a hugely successful career first as a media mogul and later as a   prime minister. Known as a Teflon politician, even when Berlusconi was eventually convicted for tax fraud in 2013 and sentenced separately for having sex with an   prostitute, many of his supporters continued to proclaim that he had fallen victim to a   conspiracy. Marchetti’s comparison between Trump and Berlusconi doesn’t end with the rhetorical style of the two men. She also sees similarities in the two entrepreneurs’ womanizing,   platforms, extravagant promises and an uncanny ability to appeal to ordinary citizens “from a lofty and   perch. ” All of this leads the writer to conclude that Donald Trump is “an American Silvio Berlusconi. ” Like Trump, Berlusconi came to politics late in his career, presenting himself as a populist,   candidate who had proven himself in the private sector. Many believed his business acumen would help reignite Italy’s flagging economy and signal a break with the notorious corruption and instability of the Italian political machine. Marchetti claims that the Italian experience suggests that “Trump’s American voters should be careful what they ask for. ” Once in office, she observes, the reality of Prime Minister Berlusconi was quite different than what candidate Berlusconi had pledged. While promising less taxes for everyone, Berlusconi oversaw a general rise in Italy’s tax rate, which hit 54 percent in 2013 —  the highest level in Europe. “Berlusconi revealed himself a great campaign manager, but a terrible man of government,” said Giovanni Orsina, director at the   Luiss University School of Government. “His flamboyant promises never met up to expectations. His idea of politics as showbiz was a failure. ” Marchetti writes that Berlusconi’s tendency for   “ended in international humiliation for Italy,” and suggests that a Trump presidency could end similarly for America, “not just with personal embarrassment, but with carnage in the political system. ” Some Italians strike a pose of political sentinels, warning unwary Americans of what they might be getting into with a Trump presidency. “Berlusconi and Trump have the power to touch raw nerves and split a nation,” said Alberto Bianchi, a northern Italian banker. “Verbal leads to physical violence. ” Marchetti also cites Mirella Fabi, a Rome shopkeeper in Rome, who claims that Berlusconi “rose to power only to pursue his own economic interests, passed   laws and ended up bringing starlets and prostitutes into parliament and government. ” “He’s a con man who fooled us all,” Fabi said. The Politico editorial acknowledges that since Trump hasn’t yet held any kind of office, it impossible to know how his words will translate into action. But they clearly hope that by drawing parallels between the Italian experience of Berlusconi and his American political doppelganger, some voters will be led to question the expedience of a Trump presidency. Every election implies risk, they seem to say. The question is whether a Trump tenure in the White House would be worth it. Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter   Follow @   <!

"Singapore GP: Nico Rosberg on pole after qualifying, Lewis Hamilton in third"," (CNN) Nico Rosberg will start on pole in the Singapore Grand Prix after an imperious performance in qualifying. Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton, who leads Rosberg by two points in the driver standings, only just managed to hold off Red Bull’s Max Verstappen to secure third. Verstappen’s teammate, Daniel Ricciardo, put on an impressive drive and will start second    but still finished 0. 531s behind Rosberg. ”Definitely happy with that one,” Rosberg told reporters after qualifying. ”For sure one of my top three laps ever and I’m so happy that it came on my 200th GP weekend. ”At times it wasn’t clear where we would stack up against Red Bull so I knew I had to pull one out of the bag. ”I’m not worried [about Ricciardo starting from P2] but I’ll certainly be keeping my eye on him!” Hamilton, who struggled throughout practice, was understandably despondent but can take heart from earlier performances this season when starting further back on the grid. ”It has not been my weekend so far,” said the reigning world champion. ”Not many good laps. I’ve just not been able to string them together.” ”But Nico did a great job and showed the real potential of the car.” Despite securing fourth, Dutchman Verstappen was disappointed with his final performance of an eventful weekend    the highlight perhaps being a chance encounter with a ”giant lizard.” ”I’m not happy. The whole weekend has been strong but I really wasn’t comfortable in Q3.” It has also been an unhappy couple of days for   Singapore GP winner Sebastian Vettel, who will start last after a suspension problem meant he was unable to set a competitive time."
Senate Intelligence Committee Leaders Vow Thorough Russian Investigation - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Senators leading the investigation into Russian interference in the November election pledged on Wednesday to conduct an aggressive inquiry, including an examination of any ties to President Trump, as they sought to distance themselves from the flagging efforts in the House. In a conspicuous show of bipartisanship during a fractious time at the Capitol, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee vowed to forge ahead by interviewing key players connected to Mr. Trump and pressing intelligence agencies to provide all relevant information. But their display of collegiality seemed intended primarily as a contrast to the explosive and often bewildering statements in recent days from the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Devin Nunes of California, whose perceived closeness with the Trump White House has raised doubts about his ability to conduct an impartial investigation. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and a supporter of Mr. Trump during the campaign, suggested on Wednesday that he would not retreat from a process that could damage the reputation of a Republican president. “This investigation’s scope will go wherever the intelligence leads,” Mr. Burr said during a rare joint news conference. Asked later whether he had encountered any “direct links” between Mr. Trump and Russia’s interference, Mr. Burr was stern. “We know that our challenge,” he said, “is to answer that question for the American people. ” The Senate investigation amounts to a credibility test for Republicans under the Trump administration  —   a chance to prove their willingness to ask uncomfortable questions of a Republican president, even if the answers might weaken his and the party’s standing. Democrats are skeptical. But they are also mindful that the Senate most likely remains their best hope on Capitol Hill for gathering information, making them disinclined to abandon the Senate Intelligence Committee’s investigation. The F. B. I. is also investigating. On Wednesday, Mr. Burr and his Democratic counterpart on the committee, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, offered some evidence of what they had reviewed so far, saying they had begun to schedule the first of at least 20 interviews. Mr. Warner drew attention to reports of perhaps 1, 000 internet trolls in Russia generating fake news stories and targeting them at swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. “Russia’s goal, Vladimir Putin’s goal, is a weaker United States,” he said. Mr. Burr noted that Russians were now “actively involved” in the French elections. On Thursday, the committee will hold a public hearing on Russian influence on campaigns broadly. The two also left little doubt that they viewed the House’s unruly process as an afterthought, one that should not reflect on their own efforts. “Let me set the ground rules real quick,” Mr. Burr said before taking questions. “We’ll answer anything about the Senate Intelligence Committee’s investigation. We will not take questions on the House Intelligence Committee. ” Mr. Burr could not suppress a smirk. Mr. Warner laughed outright. But the drama in the House has already complicated the Senate’s task, according to Senate committee members, leading the public to question congressional inquiries across the board. “I worry that the chaos on the House side has affected the public’s view on whether Congress can credibly investigate this matter,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and a committee member. “I believe the answer to that is still yes, and that the Senate is the place. ” Lamenting the “debacle” in the House, Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California and another committee member, said she believed that “the public is now shifting to us. ” The congressional investigations are not related, but their focuses overlap, leaving the Senate panel to defend itself in the face of Mr. Nunes’s assorted claims. While a vast majority of Republicans in the House have stood by Mr. Nunes amid calls for him to recuse himself, his furtive maneuvering  —   including bypassing his committee to brief the White House about relevant intelligence  —   has placed House committee members in a difficult spot. And at least one Republican lawmaker, Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, suggested on Wednesday that the Senate should take the lead on Congress’s investigation into ties between the president’s orbit and Russia. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has long resisted calls for a special prosecutor or select committee, saying the Senate could do the job through regular protocol. On the House side, a string of perplexing decisions by Mr. Nunes has threatened to unravel the panel’s investigation altogether. Last week, he abruptly announced that he had obtained information indicating that people associated with the Trump transition may have been “incidentally” caught up in legal surveillance of foreign operatives. He also bypassed the committee’s top Democrat, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, to brief Mr. Trump. The president seized on the information, misleadingly, as evidence for his thoroughly debunked claim that President Barack Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower  —   an allegation dismissed not only by senior law enforcement officials, like the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, but also by the heads of the Senate and House investigations, including Mr. Nunes. Another obstacle to bipartisanship came on Monday, with the revelation that Mr. Nunes had viewed what he characterized as “dozens” of reports containing classified information on the grounds of the White House. Democrats fumed, their suspicions fueled by speculation that the source of Mr. Nunes’s information was a Trump administration official and that Mr. Nunes may have even coordinated with the White House. While Mr. Nunes defended himself by saying that he needed to be at the White House to view the sensitive documents in question, one can peruse sensitive information at the Capitol and at other spots around Washington. Democrats have also chafed at Mr. Nunes’s shuffling of the hearing schedule. Earlier this month, with Mr. Schiff by his side, Mr. Nunes announced plans for three former officials to testify, a group that would include Sally Q. Yates, who briefly served as acting attorney general and alerted the administration that Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, appeared to have lied about his contact with Russian officials. Last week, Mr. Nunes scrapped that public hearing, arguing that the committee first needed more time to question intelligence leaders. But on Tuesday he said this hearing had been postponed as well  —   as The Washington Post reported that White House officials had tried to stymie Ms. Yates’s testimony. Democrats have accused Mr. Nunes of trying to stall not only the investigation but also the committee as a whole. Mr. Warner said on Wednesday that he would “like to see Ms. Yates at some point” before his committee. At the same time, the Senate investigation has not been  . Last month, Mr. Warner publicly scolded Mr. Burr after reports that Mr. Burr had spoken with the White House and engaged with news organizations to dispute reports that Trump associates had been in consistent contact with Russian intelligence operatives. In an emailed statement on Wednesday, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, took care to praise Mr. Warner  —   though not Mr. Burr  —   as he expressed confidence in the Senate inquiry. “Mark Warner realizes the importance of the task in front of him, and is pursuing it diligently and smartly,” Mr. Schumer said. “That gives the Democrats a lot of faith that the process on the Senate side can work. ” At the news conference, Mr. Burr said that “contrary to maybe popular belief,” he and Mr. Warner were partners. And he insisted that his party allegiance would not supersede the duties of his office. “I’ll do something I’ve never done: I’ll admit that I voted for him,” Mr. Burr said of Mr. Trump. “But I’ve got a job in the United States Senate. ”"
’Free-range’ parents face neglect investigation," (CNN) It’s starting to feel a little bit like Groundhog Day when it comes to parents under attack for letting their children do things on their own. The latest case? A Silver Spring, Maryland, couple is facing a neglect investigation for letting their    son and      daughter walk home from a playground, about a mile from their house, by themselves on a Saturday afternoon in late December. The story immediately brought to mind the South Carolina mom arrested for letting her    daughter play at the park alone while she worked at a McDonald’s and a Florida mom arrested after letting her    walk to the park alone.  Is it just me or have things suddenly gotten way out of hand when parents are being arrested    or investigated    for doing what was considered totally normal and appropriate just a few decades ago? ’I’m a   parent’ I asked Danielle Meitiv, the mother at the center of this latest national story, about her parenting philosophy. ”The funny thing is, it’s so funny to call it a philosophy,” Meitiv said. Brutally Honest: When is it OK to leave your teen home alone overnight? ”In terms of crime, I lived in a more dangerous time period and my parents lived in a more dangerous time period . .. so it just never occurred to me that this has to be a philosophy.”  Growing up in Flushing, Queens, in New York, she would go to the bowling alley or library at a young age by herself. ”The idea that a parent would escort you somewhere, I mean my mother would have cracked up, ’What are you, nuts?’ ”  As Meitiv’s kids got older, she and her husband grew more aware of the whole concept of helicopter parenting    and the idea that kids had to be supervised all the time. She started looking up information and found the book ”  Kids” by Lenore Skenazy and began following her online blog, too. ”So from that, I would say, ’Yeah, I’m a   parent,’ ” she said. ”Again, to me, the idea is, what happened to just parenting?”  ’World’s Worst Mom’ Skenazy, a New York mom, television host, speaker and author, was called the worst mother on the planet and meaner things than we could include in this article after she wrote a story in 2008 on why she let her    son take the subway by himself. After the uproar about her parenting, she wrote the book and started a blog, and now hosts a show called ”World’s Worst Mom?” airing at 9 p. m. ET Thursdays on the Discovery Life Channel. Mom arrested for leaving    alone at the park  Skenazy actually broke the story on Reason. com about the Meitivs being under investigation by Montgomery County’s Child Protective Services after they let their children walk home from a playground by themselves. ”We’ve been encouraged in our society to do what I call   thinking, which is come up with the   scenario first and proceed as if it’s likely to happen, and that’s what happened with the Meitivs,”  Skenazy said. ”Someone sees two children alone, and they leap to ’Oh, my God, they’re neglected. What if they’re run over by a Mack truck? What if they’re kidnapped? There are predators all around.’ ” Crime rates are way down from when many of us were kids in the ’70s rape, murder, burglary and arson are all down, said Skenazy, so it’s not exactly true to think today’s world is scarier than when I walked four blocks to the candy store when I was in the first grade. ”And if we are going to say, ’Oh, my God, I would never let my kid walk outside something bad could happen,’ well, I hope you’re saying that ’Oh, my God, I would never put my kid in the car, something bad could happen,’ because the No. 1 way children die in America is as car passengers, and yet we seem to keep that ’danger’ in perspective, but we can’t keep the same perspective when it comes to letting our children walk outside,” she added. ’The next evolution in their ranging’ The afternoon that thrust the Meitivs into the national spotlight was as normal as you can get. Alexander Meitiv and the kids were heading home after synagogue (Danielle was in New York for a family event) when they passed the playground the kids had been begging to go to for weeks. This playground was going to be ”the next evolution of their ranging,” Meitiv said. She and her husband felt they were ready, and so he dropped them off at the playground and told them to return home in a little while. Florida mom arrested after letting    walk to the park alone  About halfway on their walk home, the children were stopped by two police vehicles, Meitiv said. When officers asked whether they were lost or in trouble, the kids told them they were fine, that their parents knew where they were and that they are allowed to walk home by themselves, she said. The police drove the kids home to the Meitivs’ house. Rafi Meitiv, who’s 10, called his mother crying, ”Mommy, the police are here. I’m afraid they’re going to arrest Daddy,” she remembered him saying. Alexander Meitiv was not arrested, but a few hours later, someone from Child Protective Services arrived and said the family needed to agree not to let the children be unsupervised until the matter was resolved within the agency, or the children would be taken into the custody of Child Protective Services. After a number of calls with CPS, and after CPS allegedly interviewed the Meitivs’ children without their knowledge and without a parent being present, they are still waiting to have an   meeting with the agency. Brutally Honest: Is it OK to let your children fail? ”This is no joke,” said Danielle Meitiv. ”The threat that they can take my kids is real.” The Montgomery County Health and Human Services Department said it is bound by state confidentiality laws preventing it from commenting on a specific case. ”Like all Departments of Social Services in Maryland, Montgomery County Child Protective Services is required to respond to all calls from community members and law enforcement about possible neglect,” the statement said. Most states don’t have laws on the books regarding how old a child must be to be left alone. Maryland is one of the few that does, stating that children under 8 years old may not be left unattended in a house or car. There isn’t anything stipulated within the law about kids being alone outside. This is not the first time the Meitivs have been approached by CPS. In October, a few days after Danielle Meitiv let the kids play at a playground around the block from their house and walk home by themselves, two CPS workers came to her door after they were contacted by someone mostly likely from the neighborhood, Meitiv said. That case was eventually closed. ”We have no problem with people looking out for our kids. That’s actually what people always did, look out for each other,” Meitiv said. ”It’s the idea that looking out for them then becomes reporting them to the police and making it criminal . .. that it becomes somehow this is neglect. My kids were playing at the park.” Reaction from parents nationwide   The story has gotten a ton of traction online, with many parents expressing outrage about another case of a parent under investigation for letting children do things on their own. ”The parents in the above referenced story have the right to raise their kids as they wish. I do not think it is a CPS issue,” wrote Annette Lanteri, a lawyer and mom of two girls in Bayport, New York, in an email. ”I personally give them credit for allowing their kids to have freedom at such a young age.” ’Brutally Honest’: Is it OK to spy on your kids? Cherylyn Harley LeBon, a mom of two, said that whether she decides to let her children walk to the park alone is ”simply her business,” not her neighbors’. ”And if there is a bona fide question of neglect in my household, then Child Protective Services should be notified. Anything less than that is government overreach,” said Harley LeBon, a writer, strategist and former senior counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Laura Beyer, a mom of two grown daughters, said she doesn’t believe the parents were negligent in this case, because the children were ”obviously capable” of simply walking to and from the park. ”My thought is if those of us who care for others would simply ’keep an eye on’ children as we drive to and fro, they would be safe nonetheless,” Beyer said. ”If you see a child walking and he or she is being approached by what seems to be a stranger, pull to the side of the road and ask if he or she is OK.” But some parents are asking questions about how young is too young to leave kids alone and how much one’s community should play in that decision. Terry Greenwald, a father of three in Alaska,  said, ”In a small town where the parent feels their children are safe, I’d understand a parent allowing some freedom, at least more so than someone living in a larger city. ”The world is a dangerous place, though, and we all need to protect ourselves and our children, especially our children,” said Greenwald. The Meitivs hope their story helps get the message out that parents today may too often overestimate the danger and underestimate their kids. ”Our children need the freedom to grow into the happy, healthy, confident adults we want them to be, so we should trust our kids more,” Meitiv said. Do you think it’s OK to let children walk home alone at a certain age? Share your thoughts with Kelly Wallace on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook."

San Diego homeless killings: Police arrest suspect," (CNN) San Diego police on Thursday morning arrested a    man in connection with a series of attacks on the California city’s homeless population, police announced. Anthony Alexander Padgett was taken into custody in Chula Vista, just south of San Diego, Capt. David Nisleit told reporters. Nisleit said police had probable cause for the arrest but didn’t offer specifics. He said the investigation is ongoing and indicated tips from the public led to Padgett’s arrest. Authorities have not determined whether Padgett is their only suspect. Two homeless men have been killed    one set on fire, the other beaten to death    and two others were hospitalized with serious injuries, one who was beaten and the other set afire.  The first three attacks occurred in 25 hours from early Sunday to Monday. The fourth happened around 5 a. m. Wednesday, when authorities found a man ablaze on the ground across from the federal courthouse downtown.  That victim, a    man, was taken to a hospital and is expected to survive, Nisleit said Wednesday. A    man who was beaten is also expected to survive, he said. The motive for the attacks is unknown.  Detectives have surveillance video from a convenience store. Nisleit said Thursday that police believe Padgett is on that video. ”This killer has targeted some of our city’s most vulnerable residents while they are asleep,” Police Chief Shelley Zimmerman said. ”Please, please, please    public safety is a shared responsibility.” Nisleit said a burning towel was found on the latest victim. Witnesses saw a man crouched over the victim and described what they initially thought were burning clothes. On Sunday morning, witnesses reported seeing a man on fire running down the train tracks alongside Interstate 5, according to CNN affiliate KSWB.  Police later found the badly charred body of a male. About the same time, witnesses reported seeing another man in his late 40s to early 50s darting across the freeway away from the train tracks carrying a gas can, said Lt. Manny Del Toro with the San Diego Police. Two similar attacks took place early Monday morning, when officers found two more victims with severe trauma injuries, one who later died, police say. ”We’re absolutely convinced these attacks are linked,” Nisleit said. ”We’re working through all these cases again.” All the attacks appear to be ”senseless, random attacks on the homeless,” he said. He encouraged the homeless population to sleep and walk in groups and noted that the attacks have been unnerving for the city. ”It is extremely unsettling for the public, it is extremely unsettling for the homeless population and it is extremely unsettling for the San Diego Police Department,” Nisleit said. This isn’t the first time San Diego County has seen violence targeting the homeless and transient populations. Earlier this year, two brothers and a female teenager were accused of fatally beating a homeless man in El Cajon after one of the brothers allegedly got into a fight with some other homeless people in the area."
Opinion: A Chicago (tough) love letter," (CNN) Monday night on television showcased the best and worst of America’s third largest city: On one channel, the Chicago Cubs were winning their 100th game of the season    a first since 1935. On almost every other channel, Donald Trump was reminding us that Chicago has had ”thousands” of shootings this year. This month, the city passed the grim milestone of 500 homicides in 2016. Trump made me cringe    and not in the way he makes many Americans cringe. As a defender of Chicago, I cringed because he’s right, and I wondered what the estimated 80 million viewers must think about the city I love. I’ve had a soft spot for Chicago and its inner city since high school, when, as a reporter for the Carl Sandburg High School student newspaper, I left my suburban enclave to report on life as a student growing up in the city. Kids in the suburbs only knew Chicagoans from the bloody top stories on the local news.  On field trips to downtown museums I’d hear comments like, ”Do you know what you’d see down here at night?”  I’d think, ”Yes, a lot of tourists on Michigan Avenue and   commuters trying to get home after a late night at the office.”  Of course, crime is a factor in any large city, but I wondered why there were such stereotypical views of city life. As a Chicago Public Schools principal, my father often brought me to his school in Marquette Park on the South Side, where the kindness I experienced from students of all races further softened my heart. It gave me a different perspective of the   life that most suburbanites only pass on their way to the Bears game. My answer to such   appeared in May of 1994 on the front page of my high school paper ”The Aquila”: a collection of articles from three South Side high schools profiling students whose struggles turned out to be both similar and wildly different than my peers. ”The City You Haven’t Seen” was the headline, next to a photo of a school in the shadows of the Robert Taylor Homes, a housing project (now demolished) along the Dan Ryan Expressway that stood as a monument to the worst of city life.  Even now, I remember the guilt I felt over giving this story the lead position on the front page of the school paper when most students were buzzing about graduation and summer break, not cultural disparity. But it was my senior year and my platform to tell this story was about to vanish, so I hijacked the news cycle in hopes I would bridge a gap between city and suburbs, stereotypes and truths, whites and blacks. It’s the same divide I want bridged today, as I watch Chicago admonished on a scale much larger than the school bus bombast that motivated me years ago. A case can be made for Chicago not to bear the brunt of national outrage: its per capita murder rate over the last 30 years is actually lower than cities like St. Louis, Detroit and New Orleans. Its downtown and lakefront museum campus is even more vibrant than when I graduated from college in 1998 with a journalism degree. In a bid to attract younger workers, McDonald’s is moving its corporate headquarters from the suburbs to a brand new campus on Oprah Winfrey’s former Harpo Studios lot in the West Loop.  How could a city this grand be so maligned in the national spotlight? Then last year, as a television producer, I covered the Black Friday protest in Chicago following the police shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald. It culminated in the blockage of store entrances on the Magnificent Mile in a surreal scene that brought Chicago’s premiere shopping district to a standstill. The protesters’ point was this: as the Magnificent Mile flourishes, as city fathers bask in the success of their crown jewels downtown and on the North Side, we can’t be forgotten the neighborhoods stuck in cycles of poverty and gang violence need attention too.  They’re right    the city has been developed for me. That suburban kid who now wants a life in the city who wants to root on the Cubs who wants to enjoy Millennium Park concerts and happy hours in Lincoln Park. I realize now I defend Chicago because of what it does for me, not what it does    or doesn’t do    for the 1. 5 million black and Hispanic people that may see it a different way.  The problems in Chicago are rooted in history    a city more segregated than New York and Los Angeles that allows for economic disparity to fall along racial lines. Gangs and gun violence flourish in this economic void. I don’t know if it’s all the fault of city government, or if those protesting could be more a part of the solution in their own lives, but I do know that when protesters shut down the Magnificent Mile last year they had enough respect not to destroy it. So I’m listening. In a few weeks, I’ll be listening a lot more to the roar of Cubs fans who hold out hope that their   World Series drought will come to an end. If it happens, it will change the worldwide narrative on Chicago the city will celebrate and the world will join in. It will bring the kind of headlines that don’t make me cringe. But I now realize that good news alone won’t fix life for those stuck in poverty and who fear that their children won’t make it home from school. A World Series does not bring a better life. The last one came to Chicago in 2005, when the White Sox brought the crown to the South Side. Neighborhoods suppressed by violence finally had reason to celebrate, though it didn’t last.  Fireworks, we now know, can only mask gunshots for so long."
Oroville Dam: California officials ignored warnings a decade ago," (CNN) Environmental groups warned nearly 12 years ago that the nation’s tallest dam in California was an imminent disaster.  They worried that heavy rain and   waters could overwhelm the main concrete spillway of the Oroville Dam, overflow the emergency spillway and flood communities downstream.  They were ignored. And this weekend, some of their fears were realized.  Ron Stork, policy director with Friends of the River, a Sacramento environmental group, said state and federal officials were told to reinforce the spillway.  ”We urged them to put concrete on the spillway    our argument was that without a proper spillway, the hillside would wash away and cause catastrophic flooding,” Stork said.  A perfect storm of events led this month to the partial failure of the dam, which provides flood control for the region.  ”Extreme hydrologic events precipitated this ” said Blake Paul Tullis, a professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Utah State University. First, powerful storms dumped rain and snow across California.  The high waters caused Lake Oroville’s level to rise to the top, and the water couldn’t be drained fast enough.  Erosion left a hole almost the size of a football field and at least 40 feet deep in the main concrete spillway. As the diverted water flowed into the emergency spillway for the first time in the nearly 50 years since it was built, it began to erode. Millions of gallons began washing over this emergency spillway, essentially an embankment covered with brush, trees and rock. ”Any spillway    primary or emergency    usually has some kind of protection, a concrete basin,” said Tullis. ”For structures as big as this, it seems pretty uncommon to not have some protection at the base of the spillway.” Authorities ordered mass evacuations for some 188, 000 people, out of concern the spillway could fail and send walls of water roaring downstream. The sudden evacuations sent residents into a panic. ”It was a slow moving crisis that picked up a lot of speed yesterday,” Stork said on Monday.  Stork said he had seen this coming way back in October of 2005 when Friends of the River, along with the Sierra Club and the South Yuba Citizens League, filed a motion with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) as part of Oroville Dam’s   process.    In the motion, they argued that the Oroville Dam    which was completed in 1968 and owned by the state of California    did not meet modern safety standards.  They stressed in the motion that the auxiliary spillway was designed to work with a replacement dam that was never built. Without that new dam, the Oroville Dam’s auxiliary spillway was designed to be used in in a controlled, infrequent way and not in an emergency capacity, they said.  The energy regulatory commission rejected their motion to reinforce the emergency spillway with concrete. Stork said money was an issue. A response filed by the State Water Contractors and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California said FERC, which issues the licenses, could not require them to pay the damages required for the upgrades.  The filing also said that flood control arguments were ”misdirected and unsupported” due to routine dam safety checks and the uncertain effects of climate change on the river basin. The acting director of the California Department of Water Resources, Bill Croyle, said he was ”not familiar with 2005 documentation or conversation” about spillway concerns. At a news conference Monday afternoon, he said that no water was overflowing the emergency spillway and lake levels were continuing to fall. Crews were breaking and bagging rocks to drop into the hole eroded in the auxiliary spillway, officials said. The solution now is to fix the broken main spillway in the summer, said Professor Tullis and Stork of the environmental group. ”If the department is unwilling or unable to keep the reservoir down so that it does not spill, then we could face the same catastrophic circumstance again,” Stork said."
"Donald Trump Rallies Badger State as Ted Cruz Leads Polls: ‘We’re Coming for You, Wisconsin’ - Breitbart","GOP frontrunner Donald Trump has launched a new radio ad in Wisconsin ahead of the Badger State primary on April 5th, next Tuesday, even as many of the conservative radio voices in Wisconsin are criticizing him. [The ad states:  I just wanted to talk to the people of Wisconsin because there’s so much misinformation that’s being put out there about me. Let’s talk taxes. If I’m president your taxes are going to go way down and if you have a small business, big. Big tax break! Every other candidate wants to cut Medicaid and Social Security, not me. It’s not going to happen! I’m going to bring jobs back from Mexico, from China, from Japan. Obamacare is a total disaster. I’m going to repeal it and replace it with something so much better. At the same time, we’re going to make our military bigger, better and stronger than it’s ever been. Nobody is every going to mess with us again. And we’re going to get rid of ISIS fast. And we’re going to take care of our vets. I’ll never let you down. Please go vote on Tuesday. We’re going to make America Great Again! The radio ad comes on the same day the real estate mogul launched an attack ad on Instagram against Sen. Ted Cruz ( ). The Instagram ad begins with text that reads: “Nobody likes Ted. ” It then cuts to soundbites of several individuals expressing their disapproval of Cruz. “Ted Cruz was my roommate. I did not like him at all in college,” the voice of Craig Mazin says. The ad also includes a soundbite from Sen. Lindsey Graham ( ) who after suspending his campaign endorsed Gov. Jeb Bush, and now Cruz, saying, “I think he’s been just as wrong as Obama if not worse. ” The ad concludes with the text: “TRUSTED?” The attack comes as Cruz leads Trump by 10 points in the latest poll. Trump added two events to his schedule Saturday, and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who endorsed Trump, is in Wisconsin campaigning for him. Trump also rallied his supporters in a campaign email on Friday. “Wisconsin has been great to me over the past week and I have a full few days of events planned until the election on Tuesday,” Trump’s campaign email reads. I have enjoyed interacting with voters at town hall events and was so inspired by Melissa Young, the mother, and former Miss Wisconsin, battling terminal cancer. She was an inspiration to everyone, including me. I visited Janesville, Green Bay, Appleton, Milwaukee and will return this weekend to visit Racine, Wausau, Eau Claire, and West Allis. Trump also updated his supporters on his visit on Thursday to Washington, D. C. where he met with his foreign policy team, adding, “[We] had an   discussion about the recent tragedies, and solutions we can implement moving forward.  Rebuilding our military has been a key issue for me throughout my campaign and I take that, coupled with taking care of our great veterans very seriously. ” #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Donald J.

"Runaway Trailer Runs Over, Kills Convicted Sex Offender Watching Porn on Cell Phone - Breitbart","Police in Tennessee say a man walking down the street while watching porn on his cell phone was killed when he didn’t notice a runaway trailer barreling his way. [Witnesses told officers that    Kevin Jordan was carelessly walking down the sidewalk on Park Avenue in Memphis with his attention fixed on pornography playing on his cell phone. Apparently Jordan didn’t look up in time to see that a   trailer had come unhitched from a passing pickup truck and was racing toward him.  Jordan was struck and killed by the runaway trailer. Some, though, felt Jordan’s death was tinged with a dash of irony because the accident victim was a registered sex offender with convictions for rape on his record. “I think it is ironic that he was watching porn. And this dealt with some of the crimes he may have perpetrated. ” local dentist Dr. Peter Trimble told WSMV TV. Jordan was convicted of violent sexual assault and rape in 1994 and was sentenced to 25 years in jail. He was described as the “Highland Street Rapist” in the 1990s when he was apprehended and convicted for rape. Jordan was released on good behavior only a few years ago and is listed on the Tennessee sex offender registry. Despite his good behavior release in 2010, the convicted felon was also recently cited for indecent exposure. But the accident victim’s fiancé said that the death was tragic because he was trying to get his life in order and get over his violent past. Fiancé Connie Harris said Jordan “had his life in order” and insisted that she still loved him even in death. She also claimed that his recent citation of indecent exposure was not a sexual crime. She said he was urinating in an alley when a woman walked by and saw him. The driver of the 2008 Dodge Ram who was hauling the trailer has not been charged with anything yet, but Memphis police say they are still investigating the incident. If Jordan had been required to serve his full prison sentence, he’d still be in jail and would not have been on that sidewalk that fateful night.

Electoral Map Gives Donald Trump Few Places to Go - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump, confronting a daunting electoral map and a significant financial disadvantage, is preparing to fall back from an expansive national campaign and concentrate the bulk of his time and money on just three or four states that his campaign believes he must sweep in order to win the presidency. Even as Mr. Trump has ticked up in national polls in recent weeks, senior Republicans say his path to the 270 Electoral College votes needed for election has remained narrow  —   and may have grown even more precarious. It now looks exceedingly difficult for him to assemble even the barest Electoral College majority without beating Hillary Clinton in a trifecta of the biggest swing states: Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. President Obama won all three states in 2008 and 2012, and no Republican has won Pennsylvania in nearly three decades. With a divisive campaign message that has alienated many women and Hispanics, Mr. Trump appears to have pushed several traditional swing states out of his own reach. According to strategists on both sides of the race, polling indicates that Mrs. Clinton has a solid upper hand in Colorado and Virginia, the home state of Senator Tim Kaine, her running mate. Both states voted twice for George W. Bush, who assiduously courted Hispanic voters and suburban moderates. In addition, Trump allies have grown concerned about North Carolina, a   state that has large communities of black voters and   whites  —   two audiences with which Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular. While Mr. Trump is not ready to give up entirely on any of the major battlegrounds, advisers have become increasingly convinced that his most plausible route to the presidency, and perhaps his only realistic victory scenario, involves capturing all three of the biggest contested electoral prizes on the map, and keeping North Carolina in the Republican column. Mr. Trump and his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, are expected to campaign intensively across those four   states, with Mr. Trump trumpeting a set of blunt slogans through mass media and Mr. Pence focused on shoring up support from conservatives and    whites. There is no imminent plan, Trump advisers say, to match Mrs. Clinton’s spending on television ads. Instead, they intend to aim Mr. Trump like a battering ram at a small number of targets, to keep delivering his provocative message on trade, terrorism and immigration. The primary “super PAC” backing Mr. Trump, Rebuilding America Now, is taking an identical approach: It has reserved airtime only in Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania. The main outside group supporting Mrs. Clinton, Priorities USA Action, is advertising in those three states and half a dozen more. John Brabender, a Republican strategist who has worked extensively in Pennsylvania and the Midwest, said Mr. Trump had a real but tenuous path to victory, involving a smaller map of swing states than typical for a presidential nominee. Mr. Brabender said Mr. Trump would certainly have to seize Pennsylvania, which has not voted Republican since 1988. “Does Trump have to run the table of the top three targets? Absolutely,” Mr. Brabender said. “The fact that we have to worry about winning Pennsylvania to win the presidency tells you it’s a difficult task. ” Mr. Trump’s inability to broaden the Republican electoral map has heartened supporters of Mrs. Clinton, even as Democrats in general have been dismayed by Mr. Trump’s tenacity in national polls. In the aftermath of this month’s Republican convention, Mr. Trump appeared to enjoy a modest bounce, pulling even or slightly ahead of Mrs. Clinton in several national surveys conducted before the Democratic convention. Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, a longtime political ally of the Clintons, said that Mrs. Clinton could effectively throttle the Trump campaign by winning Virginia, where he is confident of her standing, and one other swing state. He named Florida as the most inviting option. “If you put a combination together of Florida and Virginia, it’s virtually impossible for Republicans to win the presidency,” Mr. McAuliffe said. “Electoral   we are in a very strong position today. ” Each of the key states presents a mix of larger cities and less populated agricultural and former industrial areas, where Mr. Trump has most often gained traction. Mr. Trump’s message of clawing back lost jobs has resonated most in distressed manufacturing regions. But with the exception of Pennsylvania, where joblessness is slightly higher, the unemployment rate in each swing state hovers near the national average of 4. 9 percent or lower. Democrats caution that they view Mr. Trump as a   candidate with unpredictable pockets of support, potentially capable of warping the political landscape even late in the election season. For now, though, Mr. Trump is grappling with a magnified version of the dilemma that threatens to stymie Republicans every four years. Democrats have won a consistent set of 18 states in every presidential election since 1992, giving them a base of 242 Electoral College votes even before counting some of the biggest swing states. As a result, the last two Republican nominees, Mitt Romney and John McCain, would have needed to capture nearly all the contested states on the map in order to win. At an earlier point in the campaign, Mr. Trump had hoped to leverage his support from   whites and independent voters to put some overwhelmingly Democratic states in play, including New York and Massachusetts. Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman, said this month that Mr. Trump intended to compete in strongly Democratic states like New Jersey and Oregon. In an email on Thursday, Mr. Manafort said the political landscape offered Mr. Trump numerous paths to victory. “We have many different ways, much more than Romney had,” Mr. Manafort said. In private, Trump advisers say the campaign now takes a colder and more clinical view of the electoral map. Mr. Trump, Republicans believe, may have even fewer ways to count to 270 than Mr. Romney and Mr. McCain had, because of his debilitating unpopularity with women and nonwhite voters. Mr. Trump continues to fight at a severe financial and organizational disadvantage against Mrs. Clinton, leaving him without the funds to campaign effectively across all of the states Mr. Romney contested. At the end of June, Mr. Trump had less than half as much cash in reserve as Mrs. Clinton  —   $20 million to her $44 million. In several major swing states, Mr. Trump’s campaign has not yet approved final budgets for his   operations, according to Republicans in communication with his campaign, leaving Republicans on the state and national levels uncertain about his ability to mount major advertising and     operations. And in some of the most crucial states, Mr. Trump continues to face resistance within his own party: In Ohio, he has feuded openly with the popular Republican governor, John Kasich, a former primary opponent who has refused to endorse his campaign. In Florida, some of the most influential Hispanic Republicans in the southern part of the state have withheld their support, hobbling his candidacy there. The map is not entirely forbidding for Mr. Trump: Both Republicans and Democrats see him as holding an edge in Iowa, a heavily white state with six electoral votes that President Obama won twice. And some top Trump aides remain hopeful that the larger terrain of the election will shift in his direction. Trump advisers have argued to national Republicans that they are well positioned to compete in Michigan, a Rust Belt state that no Republican presidential candidate has won since 1988. Should Mr. Trump overtake Mrs. Clinton there, it would allow him a bit more room for error in one of the other cornerstone states. Strategists for Mrs. Clinton largely dismiss that possibility, pointing out that Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney also hoped to compete in both Michigan and Wisconsin, only to see the states slip away well before Election Day. Joel Benenson, the chief strategist for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, said Mr. Trump had not yet made inroads in any nontraditional swing states. “There isn’t any state that they’re making us play defense in, that we wouldn’t already compete vigorously in anyway,” Mr. Benenson said. Still, Mr. Pence campaigned on Thursday in the Detroit suburbs, in what amounted to an early prospecting expedition for the Trump campaign into Democratic territory. The Indiana governor intends to spend most of his time in the Rust Belt, including Ohio and Pennsylvania. Mr. Pence, who is popular on the right, is also expected to play defense for Mr. Trump in a few conservative states, like Georgia and Arizona, where Mrs. Clinton may be competitive. A former radio host, Mr. Pence will be a ubiquitous presence on conservative talk shows, to ensure that the Republican base stays loyal to its unorthodox nominee. Robin Hayes, the chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, said he anticipated that Mr. Pence, an evangelical Christian, would visit the state often to speak about “North Carolina   values. ” Mr. Hayes, a former member of Congress and a friend of Mr. Pence’s, said it was essential for Mr. Trump to defend Republicans’ grip on North Carolina in order to win nationally. “There’s no substitute for winning, and it is a critically important state,” Mr. Hayes said. “It’s going to be an absolute, bruising kind of campaign. ”"

Pope Sends Video to Mexicans: A Land ‘Beloved of God’,"In one of the most visibly affectionate messages of his papacy, Pope Francis has sent a video to the people of Mexico in preparation for his upcoming visit. [“As my trip to Mexico draws near,” Francis said, “I feel a great joy. I always have a special remembrance in my prayers for all Mexicans. I hold them in my heart, and now I can visit them and set foot on that blessed land, which is beloved of God, and so close to the Virgin Mary. ”  The Pope had expressed a desire to visit Mexico prior to his trip to the United States last September, but scheduling complications precluded it. He will now travel to the country from February   where he will visit a pediatric hospital, meet with an indigenous community in the southern Chiapas region, speak to youth and workers, and celebrate Mass at the shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe. Francis said the purpose of his visit is to travel “as a missionary of mercy and peace. ” He said that he wants to meet the Mexicans “to confess together our faith in God and share a fundamental truth in our lives, that God loves us very much, with an infinite love, beyond what we deserve. ” “I want to be close to you, but especially to you who suffer, to hug you and tell you that Jesus loves you, that He is always by your side,” he said. A year ago, the Pope ruffled a few feathers when in a private letter to an Argentinian friend, he cautioned against Argentina falling into “Mexicanization,” used in the pejorative sense of a rampant illegal drug trade as well as widespread political corruption. The Vatican was quick to offer an official apology to the country, and all signs suggest that the Mexican people had no trouble forgiving the popular Pontiff. In his video message Monday, Francis expressed happiness that the Mexican people are preparing for his trip with much prayer. “Prayer enlarges our hearts,” Francis said, “and prepares us to receive the gifts of God. Prayer enlightens our eyes to learn to see others as God sees them, to love as God loves,” he said. The Pope said that most of all, he looked forward to visiting “the house of the Virgin Mary,” referring to his visit to the national shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Catholic patroness of the Americas. “As a child,” he said, “I used to come to our Mother and put at her feet everything I carried in my heart. It’s nice to visit our mother’s house, and feel the tenderness of her gracious presence,” he said. Several days ago, the Vatican announced that Pope Francis will meet with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill en route to Mexico, becoming the first pope ever to meet with the spiritual leader of “Moscow and All Russia. ” The two church leaders agreed to meet in the Havana airport, since Kirill already planned to be in Cuba on an official visit. “This meeting of the Primates of the Catholic Church and the Russian Orthodox Church, after a long preparation, will be the first in history and will mark an important stage in relations between the two Churches,” a joint statement read.

EXCLUSIVE: Three Pakistani Men Apprehended in U.S. at Arizona Border,"Three Pakistani men were apprehended after crossing into the U. S. from Mexico in the Tucson Sector. A combination of sources  —   including official confirmation from Customs and Border Protection (CBP)  —   revealed the men were in fact apprehended and are currently in U. S. federal custody. [Breitbart Texas sources first released the information and CBP confirmed via email. CPB responded:  U. S. Border Patrol agents in Nogales, AZ, apprehended three Pakistani nationals on Nov. 11. As a standard procedure, agents processed the individuals and checked their identities against numerous law enforcement and national security related databases. Record checks revealed no derogatory information about the individuals. The individuals are currently in Federal custody while they await the outcome of their immigration cases. Additional information on the individuals was obtained by federal agents working under the umbrella of CBP, but it is important to note that the additional details were not confirmed by CBP. “One of them had a shit load of hits from a bunch of places he’s been. He had entered and exited numerous countries that were not in his route to the U. S. This raises red flags because people leaving a foreign country to come here usually take the quickest route, but one of them did not,” said one of the sources. The source continued, “One of the men had his hair died blonde to disguise his appearance and all of the men spoke perfect English. ” Breitbart Texas previously broke the news that five men from Pakistan and one from Afghanistan were caught within 17 miles of the U. S.  border in the same vicinity as the current apprehensions of Pakistani men. In that case, the FBI later confirmed to other news outlets that the details from Breitbart Texas sources were correct.

"In a Late-Night Move, Russia Arrests a Top Economic Official in a Bribery Case - The New York Times","MOSCOW  —   Russians awoke to an extraordinary scandal on Tuesday with the minister of economic development detained on charges of soliciting a $2 million bribe  —   the   official arrested in Russia in decades. The minister, Aleksei Ulyukayev, 60, a liberal stalwart with a trademark porcupine haircut, was detained in the middle of the night, a   tactic against officials who had fallen into disfavor that many thought had been retired. Mr. Ulyukayev was charged with extorting a $2 million bribe from Rosneft, the state oil giant, as a   for endorsing a deal for it to buy a chunk of Bashneft, a smaller,   oil company that the Kremlin recently confiscated from an oligarch. Late on Tuesday, President Vladimir V. Putin dismissed Mr. Ulyukayev from the minister’s job he had held since 2013, citing a “lack of trust. ” It was a rare bribery case to reach behind the high red walls of the Kremlin  —   though relatively small in a country where corruption is rampant  —   and to an unusual degree parted the curtains on the extended, opaque battle within the ruling elite over the direction and control of the sickly Russian economy. Amid myriad questions about what actually happened, which may never be made public, one explanation emerged as the favorite. The Kremlin and its allies, struggling to right an economy waterlogged by two years of recession, are seeking a life raft, analysts said. Mr. Ulyukayev’s mistake was to question their methods publicly. In this line of thinking, Mr. Ulyukayev was being punished for initially trying to block Rosneft from expanding its reach by purchasing Bashneft, and for generally restraining its growth. On a larger scale, the arrest served as a warning from the increasingly dominant security services that no one should challenge them. “I think the purpose of the whole thing was to eliminate resistance,” said Vladimir S. Milov, an opposition politician and former deputy minister of energy who now leads a think tank. “The message is, ‘Don’t stand in my way.’ A clear message for all future deals. ” The basic scenario goes something like this: As the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, a former K. G. B. agent and Putin confidant, is sitting on about $15 billion in cash. With the state’s two main reserve funds dwindling, the Russian government covets that cash. Mr. Sechin’s purchase of state assets transfers that money directly into the Russian treasury. It also increases his power, though there was a small wrinkle in the form of a law suggesting, except in extreme instances, that state assets should be sold into private hands. A private company, Lukoil, also expressed interest at a lower price. As minister of economic development, Mr. Ulyukayev had to sign off on the sale of any state assets. So Bashneft was a major test case. Mr. Sechin wanted it for Rosneft, despite the law and the widespread, negative public perception that the elite was once again, as it did in the 1990s, abusing privatization laws to seize commodity resources at bargain prices. Mr. Ulyukayev tried to postpone the deal, but Mr. Putin backed the sale after initially hesitating. In October, it was announced that Rosneft would acquire a little more than half of Bashneft for more than $5 billion. Mr. Sechin is known for a take no prisoners attitude toward anyone who challenges him, so the bribery charges against Mr. Ulyukayev were interpreted as revenge. For Mr. Putin, the nation’s special reserve funds have served as Russia’s main, tangible economic cushion. “The reserve funds have been something sacred. Putin always refers to them when he talks about economic difficulties,” Mr. Milov said. “They have been used as a strong, public indicator that the state still has capabilities. ” But they are shrinking fast with no economic revival in sight. Two sovereign funds, the Reserve Fund and the National Wealth Fund, are now down to less than $104 billion, compared with a combined $160 billion at the beginning of 2015, according to the Finance Ministry’s website. The financial reserves are expected to run out by the end of 2017, just as Mr. Putin faces a campaign for a fourth term in the spring of 2018. The Rosneft stash would help tide over the country for a longer period while the Kremlin ties its hopes to a rebound in the price of oil and the possible lifting of Western sanctions imposed over Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the Ukraine crisis. Prospects for the latter brightened with   Donald J. Trump’s criticism of the American policy of isolating Russia. For now, the Russian economy hovers around zero growth, and consumers still struggle with inflation caused by a sharp drop in the ruble, along with food restrictions imposed in response to the Western sanctions. With minimal outside investment, Russia’s economic fate is increasingly in the hands of the state. New statistics from the federal antimonopoly service show that the government controls about 70 percent of the economy, compared with 35 percent in 2005. Olga V. Kryshtanovskaya, a leading sociologist who studies the Russian elite, said the Ulyukayev case cast a shadow over the entire government. “People resent the fact that they had to give up French cheese in order to support the president’s policies and such corruption cases still erupt,” she said in an interview. On Tuesday, the Kremlin cranked its information machinery into high gear to paint the arrest as part of a continuing anticorruption crusade that has included the arrest of three governors in the last two years. A report called “Fight Against Corruption” was the top one for much of the day on the main   television news network. A caravan of politicians appeared on screen to praise the arrest as evidence that nobody was above the law. Mr. Ulyukayev was charged with extorting a   bribe, Svetlana Petrenko, a spokeswoman for Russia’s Investigative Committee, said on state television. Mr. Ulyukayev threatened to use his official standing to create future problems for Rosneft, she said, and was detained on Monday while accepting $2 million. Russian security services had monitored Mr. Ulyukayev’s telephone calls for a year, and Rosneft had put the $2 million in a safe deposit box, according to various news reports, but the accused had not touched it. Timofei Gridnev, identified by Business FM radio as Mr. Ulyukayev’s lawyer, said the minister denied all the charges, calling them a “provocation” by Rosneft against a government official. Mr. Ulyukayev was put under house arrest for two months. Another school of thought, though not as widespread as the revenge story, holds that the bribery scandal was meant to hurt Rosneft, to show that it was a source of corruption and so to weaken Mr. Sechin. Evidence for that was harder to find, however, especially because various politicians had demanded Mr. Ulyukayev’s head. Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the leader of the Communist Party, suggested that Mr. Ulyukayev was happy to enrich himself while denying the funds needed for a children’s cancer hospital in Moscow. Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, told Russian reporters, “This is a very serious accusation which calls for very serious evidence. ” He said a court would make the ultimate determination about Mr. Ulyukayev’s guilt or innocence. There was some mocking criticism of the charges from business leaders and others. Apparently referring to Mr. Sechin’s reputation, Alexander N. Shokhin, the president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, told the website Gazeta. ru that anyone who tried to shake down Rosneft for money should be the subject of a psychiatric investigation rather than a police investigation. “If Alexei Ulyukayev had been accused of running over an old lady while driving a Gelandewagen at high speed through Moscow late at night, even that would look more probable,” Mr. Shokhin said. Ilya Shumanov of Transparency International, which fights corruption, told RBC Daily, a financial newspaper, that a $2 million bribe was a paltry, unrealistic sum in Russia’s moneyed oil industry, suggesting that was the kind of sum a deputy mayor might solicit. A recent   among Mr. Putin’s advisers prompted some analysts to suggest that Mr. Ulyukayev’s arrest was part of a trend of replacing seasoned veterans with a younger generation less likely to question the president’s decisions. Many analysts, however, considered the arrest part of a different trend: the increasing power of the siloviki, or members of the security services, over the whole government. Oleg Feoktistov, the head of security at Rosneft and identified in news reports as the main executive behind Mr. Ulyukayev’s arrest, used to run internal security and corruption cases in the federal security service, or F. S. B. “In the past six to eight months, these repressions have become more widespread,” said Kirill Rogov, an independent political analyst. “This is directly linked to the new people occupying new posts in the F. S. B. who want to expand their turf. ”"
"Watch: Ewan McGregor Plays Jesus, Lucifer in ’Last Days in the Desert’","Actor Ewan McGregor portrays both Jesus and Lucifer in Rodrigo García’s Last Days in the Desert. [The   picture is “an imagined chapter from Jesus’ forty days of fasting and praying in the desert,” prior to the beginning of His ministry. On His way out of the open and unforgiving wilderness, Jesus struggles with the devil over the fate of a family in crisis.  The critically acclaimed film, which is being distributed by Broad Green Pictures, first premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2015. Variety’s Justin Chang wrote that the movie is “a quietly captivating and remarkably beautiful account of Jesus’ time in the wilderness before the beginning of his ministry. ” Chang added: Deliberately paced, sparely imagined and suffused with mystery,   Rodrigo Garcia’s seventh feature is nonetheless quite lucid and accessible in its themes of empathy, compassion and sacrifice, and grounded by a   dual performance by Ewan McGregor that plays vastly better onscreen than it sounds on paper. The film was written and directed by García, and also stars Tye Sheridan, Ciarán Hinds, Ayelet Zurer, and Susan Gray. Last Days in the Desert will make its theatrical debut on May 13."
"Home Invasion Suspect Wearing Only Underwear Shot, Killed After Attacking Pastor and Family - Breitbart","An alleged home invader wearing only underway was shot and killed after breaking into a pastor’s home and attacking the pastor and pastor’s wife.

Weekend ice storm targets central US," (CNN) It’s a dangerous setup that the Central Plains of the US knows all too well, as residents find themselves in the middle of cold, Arctic air blowing down from Canada and much warmer, humid air streaming in from the Gulf of Mexico. During the spring and fall, this clash of air masses often spawns severe storms and tornadoes    but during the winter, the result can be an equally devastating, and much more widespread ice storm. Beginning on Friday and lasting through the weekend, a   storm has been developing over the Southwestern US and is expected to bring a stretch of precipitation across the midsection of the country. With cold air at the surface and warmer air from the south moving on top of the cold, this precipitation will fall as freezing rain or sleet for long periods of the weekend for over a dozen states, from Texas all the way to Maryland. More than 30 million Americans are under some type of wintry watch, warning or advisory from this storm, and 10 million of those fall under an ice storm warning, which is where most of the significant impacts from the storm will occur.  The hardest hit states of Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri will see up to one inch of ice coating trees and roads    making travel impossible and potentially bringing power outages to millions of residents this weekend. Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin declared a state of emergency for all 77 Oklahoma counties on Thursday.  In Kansas and Missouri, nearly 200 National Guard soldiers gear up to provide emergency response assistance to local authorities.  In Missouri, three people have died on highways due to the inclement weather conditions, Missouri Dept. of Public Safety spokesman Mike O’Connell told CNN.  A   crash led to one occupant being ejected and struck by an unidentified vehicle in Platte County going southbound on Interstate 29 on Saturday, the Missouri State Highway Patrol said.  Also on Saturday, another vehicle overturned on an ice covered roadway in Nodaway County and the driver was ejected, the patrol, The Missouri State Highway Patrol reported the first road fatality on Friday. A motorist died after she lost control of her vehicle on an icy overpass while driving on Interstate 55 in southeastern Missouri.  The icy conditions caused another   death, this time in Custer County, Oklahoma.  A motorist died during a traffic collision in the western part of the state, which resulted in   pile up on Interstate 40, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol said.   The National Weather Service in Wichita, Kansas, strongly discourages travel, saying, ”Significant amounts of ice accumulations will make travel dangerous or impossible” and that ”commerce will likely be significantly impacted.”   Another office of the National Weather Service in Kansas City tweeted information aimed at those who believe that their vehicles can drive safely on ice (spoiler alert: they can’t). Ice accumulations ranging from a half inch to an inch can cause significant damage to trees and bring down power lines for widespread areas. Due to expected power outages and travel impacts, the Kansas Department of Emergency Management warns citizens to ”make sure their home emergency kits are stocked for a   supply.”  Click here for a list of what you should include in your emergency supply kit, according to the Department of Homeland Security.  The temperature will be hovering around the freezing mark for long periods of time and will likely move several hundred miles north and south on Saturday and Sunday. This will bring a variety of precipitation types to many locations, often turning from rain, to freezing rain and ice, and back to rain again several times.  If you reside in any of these states that will be impacted by the ice storm, it would be a good weekend to stay safe at home, maybe watching the slate of NFL playoff games, which include one that has been moved back due to the pending ice storm. The Kansas City Chiefs will now host the Pittsburgh Steelers at 8:20 pm ET on Sunday, according to the NFL, as opposed to the previously scheduled start time of 1:05 p. m. ET, due to ”public safety concerns in light of the forecasted storm.” Kansas City will see significant icing through the morning on Sunday, changing over to rain early in the afternoon. Moving the game back seven hours should alleviate the danger of driving on icy roads for those traveling to the game.  "
"How the Philippines saved 1,200 Jews during Holocaust"," (CNN) Even at the age of 7, Lotte Hershfield knew her world was crumbling. She avoided the benches with the sign: No dogs or Jews allowed. She couldn’t attend public schools. And the Nazis and their growling German shepherds raided her family’s house, throwing their books into a fire. As a child, ”we were very aware,” said Hershfield, now 84. Jews weren’t welcome in their own home. Growing increasingly fearful, her parents and her older brother left their hometown of Breslau, Germany, in 1938 and journeyed to an unlikely new home    the Philippines. About 1, 200 European Jews fled to the Philippines from 1937 to 1941, escaping the throes of the Nazis only to face another bloody war under Japanese occupation.   Many of the Jews came from Austria and Germany, as the   policies including the Nuremberg race laws intensified. Unable to immigrate to countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, thousands of Jews escaped to places such as Shanghai in China, Sousa in the Dominican Republic and Manila. Those who arrived in Manila didn’t realize that they had escaped the Holocaust only to be caught in the war in the Eastern Front, where the Philippines came under attack.  ”We were going from the frying pan to the fire,” Hershfield said. ”We went from Nazi persecutors to the Japanese.” The Philippines capital was liberated after a grueling, monthlong campaign in the Battle of Manila, one of the bloodiest battles of World War II, which now marks its 70th anniversary.  From persecution to a welcome, This little known chapter of history about Jewish refugees in the Philippines has inspired two documentaries and talk of a possible movie. ”We know about stories like Anne Frank, ’Schindler’s List’    the things that grab popular imagination,” said Michelle Ephraim, whose father, Frank Ephraim escaped to the Philippines after Kristallnacht in 1938. ”Once you bring an Asia element, it becomes so complicated, interesting and surprising.” About 40 of the Philippines refugees are alive today, according to documentary filmmakers. They were children when they arrived in the Philippines over 70 years ago. ”That was like a rebirth,” said Noel Izon, the filmmaker of the documentary, ”An Open Door: Jewish Rescue in the Philippines,” in which he interviewed several Jewish refugees. ”They went from certain death to this life.” Among them was Frank Ephraim, who arrived in Manila at the age of eight. He recounted his experience in his biography, ”Escape to Manila: From Nazi Tyranny to Japanese Terror.” ”My father got a lot of positive attention, coming from a place where Jews were exiled and treated so poorly,” said his daughter, of his escape from Europe. Frank Ephraim died in 2006.  ”The Filipinos were incredibly kind and treated him extremely well. There was an element of something so redemptive.” How the Philippines became a haven, Manuel Quezon, the first president of the Philippine Commonwealth, and a group of Americans that included future U. S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the Freiders, the   brothers, became increasingly concerned about the treatment of Jews in Europe during the late 1930s.  ”They had a shared view of the world, they were men who understood what was happening in Europe,” said Russ Hodge,   of the documentary ”Rescue in the Philippines.” That documentary was screened in the Philippines with the country’s president, Benigno Aquino in attendance last year.  Over poker, the men devised a strategy to bring Jewish refugees to the Philippines.   The Philippines Commonwealth remained under U. S. supervision so it could not accept people who would need public assistance. The refuge committee sought highly skilled professionals such as doctors, mechanics and accountants.  By 1938, a stream of refugees arrived including a rabbi, doctors, chemists and even a conductor, Herbert Zipper, who survived Dachau concentration camp and later became the founder of the Manila Symphony.  Quezon’s ambitions to settle 10, 000 Jews in the southern island of Mindanao were dashed as the the war arrived to the shores of the Philippines.  A new home in the tropics, For the European Jews who arrived in the Philippines, ”it was a cultural shock,” said Hershfield. ”We didn’t know the language. We had never seen any other than white people before.” The humidity was thick, the heat overpowering and the mosquitoes gigantic.  But the young Jewish refugees saw the Philippines as a new adventure. Children climbed mango trees, swam in the bay and learned Filipino songs.  Hershfield became friends with local neighbors, played sipa (a local kicking game) and relished tropical fruit such as papaya and guava. Life in Manila was running around in sandals and summer clothes. The experience differed for her parents. ”It was very difficult for my parents,” she said. ”They never really learned Tagalog. They had been westernized and they stayed mostly within their circle of other immigrants.” Many of them lived in crowded community housing where fights would break out. They had gone from being wealthy in Germany to having nothing. ”It wasn’t what they’d known before in Germany,” Izon said. ”At the same time, ”they were able to practice their religion, able to intermingle and have businesses.” Hershfield’s idyllic days of playing under the Manila sun came to an abrupt end as the war came ashore to the Philippines.   Japanese occupation, Starting in 1941, the Japanese occupied the Philippines. In some respects, the Jewish refugees were treated considerably better than Filipinos. What ironically protected the Jews was their German passports with the swastikas    they were viewed as allies.   ”It occurred to me later, that’s what kept us from being interned,” said Ursula Miodowski, who was 7 years old at the time.  The Japanese interned British and American residents in camps. Filipinos and American soldiers were forced to march 65 miles in the infamous Bataan Death March in which an estimated 10, 000 prisoners died.   Japanese officers confiscated residents’ homes and also hoarded crops for its military. The local economy shriveled and food became scarce. Life under the Japanese was hard and brutal, surviving refugees said. When Allied forces began taking back the Philippines, bombs fell daily. Families hid in bomb shelters, not knowing where the next one would fall. Frank Ephraim spent days hiding in a ditch, shaking with a mattress covering his head. One of Hershfield’s friends died after stepping on a mine.  ”Fires were going on all the time,” said Hershfield. ”You could see the black clouds, smell of bodies, lying there and decaying.” As the Japanese were losing Manila, the imperial troops launched a brutal urban campaign. Rapes, torture, beheadings and bayoneting of civilians were widely reported, so much so that a Japanese general Tomoyuki Yamashita was later executed for having failed to control his troops.  ”The Japanese decided to destroy Manila. They were going to give them a dead city, they set about doing that,” said Miodowski. ”They burned, they killed.” But war time in the Philippines was ”preferable to being in a concentration camp,” she said.  The monthlong urban street fighting for Manila left the capital in ashes, decimating its economy and infrastructure. The Philippines suffered nearly a million civilian deaths during the war. Despite the trauma of facing both fronts of the war, Hershfield remains grateful. ”We would not be alive today if not for the Philippines. We would’ve been destroyed in the crematorium.” Refuge remembered, In 2009, a monument honoring the Philippines was erected at the Holocaust Memorial Park in the Israeli city of Rishon Lezion. The monument, shaped like three open doors, thanks the Filipino people and its president for taking in Jewish refugees during the Holocaust. Many of the descendants of the Jewish refugees who fled to the Philippines have not forgotten their family’s place of refuge.  When Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines in November 2013, the disaster brought in relief workers from the American Jewish Distribution Committee.  Danny Pins, who is related to Hershfield and is the son of a Jewish refugee to the Philippines, headed its assessment team.  ”For me it was like coming full circle and I couldn’t help but think of what it must have been like when my grandparents and mother arrived 76 years ago,” he said. ”My going to the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan was very special. I was repaying a debt to the country that saved my family.”"
British Parliament backs Brexit ,"London (CNN) The British Parliament has passed a bill that will allow Prime Minister Theresa May to start talks to leave the European Union.  The Queen will now sign it into law, clearing the way for May to trigger Article 50, beginning the process by which Britain will give up its EU membership.  May could begin the process as early as Tuesday, but it’s expected to be postponed until the end of the month to avoid a clash with Dutch elections on Wednesday.  The First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, also threw the timetable into question earlier Monday by saying she’d ask the Scottish Parliament next week to grant her the power to call a new independence referendum    a move Downing Street said would be ”divisive.” The prospect of an independence vote, which could potentially end Scotland’s    link to Great Britain, would add further uncertainty as May embarks on formal Brexit talks.  Amendment dumped  Monday’s approval came after a back and forth in which the House of Commons rejected changes to the bill and then sent it back to the upper chamber for them to vote again.  The House of Lords voted not to insist on its original amendments giving protections to EU citizens in a   Britain and called for a ”meaningful vote” on any divorce deal.  Speaking in Edinburgh, Sturgeon said it was clear the United Kingdom was heading for a ”bad deal” on Brexit. She said May had failed to engage with her call for Scotland to remain in the European single market after Brexit, and that Scotland risked being taken out of the EU against its will.  In the Brexit referendum, Scotland bucked the UK trend and voted 62% to 38% to remain in the European Union. Sturgeon said it was for Scots to decide whether they followed the rest of the United Kingdom or forged their own path. ”I am ensuring that Scotland’s future . .. will be decided by the people of Scotland,” she told reporters at Bute House, the official residence of the Scottish first minister. ”It will be Scotland’s choice and I trust the people of Scotland to make that choice.” Divisive, Sturgeon said she wanted the referendum to take place between late 2018 and early 2019, before Brexit negotiations are completed. That would enable her to argue that Scotland should stay in the European Union as the rest of the United Kingdom left. The UK government must agree to a new Scottish vote. Downing Street on Monday said Sturgeon’s announcement was ”divisive” and that May would seek a Brexit deal in the interests of the whole United Kingdom. But the statement stopped short of saying the United Kingdom would block a new independence referendum. In the last one, in 2014, Scotland voted 55% to 45% to remain in the United Kingdom. Downing Street said there was no appetite in Scotland for a rerun. It would be politically difficult for the UK government to deny Scotland permission for another referendum. But it may seek to argue about the timing, to avoid fighting a battle over independence in Scotland at the same time as negotiating an exit from the EU.  John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, said opinion polling on Scottish independence is close. ”Nobody can be sure who would win,” he said. He said the ”No” camp has generally held a slight lead over the past year and currently leads   if undecided voters are excluded, according to opinion polls tracked by the think tank ScotCen.  But polls suggest there are more than enough undecided voters to swing the results either way. Pressure on May, May has come under increasing pressure from Parliament in recent weeks as the start of negotiations move closer. On Sunday, lawmakers published a report which warned that the government’s failure to prepare for a scenario in which no deal is reached with the European Union over Brexit would be a ”serious dereliction of duty.” The House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee said the United Kingdom should be prepared for the ”real prospect” that the   negotiation cycle may end in deadlock. ”The possibility of ’no deal’ is real enough to require the government to plan how to deal with it,” head of the committee Crispin Blunt said in the report. ”But there is no evidence to indicate that this  is receiving the consideration it deserves or that serious contingency planning is under way. The government has repeatedly said that it will walk away from a ’bad’ final deal. That makes preparing for ’no deal’ all the more essential,” he added."

Source: Sessions’ plans to testify surprised Senate intelligence panel members," (CNN) Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ letter on Saturday offering to testify before the Senate intelligence committee on Tuesday caught members of the panel by surprise, and senators are concerned he’s trying to avoid testifying publicly, a source familiar with the situation says. The committee has not confirmed the Tuesday date for Sessions’ testimony and are still discussing whether to allow him to testify in open or closed session, or both, as former FBI Director James Comey did last week. A number of members are concerned Sessions may be attempting to avoid testifying in public by scrapping his previously scheduled Senate and House Appropriations appearances this week, where he was expected to be grilled on issues related to the federal investigation into Russia’s efforts to influence the US election, several sources say. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the vice chairman of the panel, is among those concerned, a source says. Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, also a member of the intelligence panel, sent a letter to panel Chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina and Warner asking for the hearing to be open. A Justice Department official told CNN on Sunday that department officials expected the hearing would be closed but said the final decision was up to the Senate committee. "
At Least 18 Die as Tornadoes Sweep Southeast U.S. - The New York Times,"ATLANTA  —   At least 18 people were killed and 43 more injured in Georgia and Mississippi after thunderstorms and tornadoes roared through the South this weekend, leaving some things standing and some things fallen, some lives whole and others blown to bits. Charles McDowell, pastor of Barney United Methodist Church in Barney, Ga. was safe at home in nearby Valdosta on Sunday. So was the modest church where he preaches to his flock of a few dozen. But many of his members were suffering  —   their homes damaged, including roofs torn away, and their electricity off. There was little for him to do but try to reach out to them on their cellphones. “As a church,” Mr. McDowell said, “we’re praying for each other. ” Catherine Howden, a spokeswoman for Georgia’s emergency management agency, said 14 people had died and 23 had been injured in central and southern parts of the state. She said there had been up to 20 reports of tornadoes. Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency on Sunday for seven counties: Atkinson, Berrien, Brooks, Colquitt, Cook, Lowndes and Thomas. “The state is making all resources available to the impacted areas,” Mr. Deal said in a statement. He added that he was prepared to expand or extend the emergency declaration, and that he was likely to seek federal help. On Sunday afternoon, during a ceremony to swear in senior White House staff members, President Trump said he had spoken with Mr. Deal, and noted that Florida and Alabama had also been hit. Mr. Trump said he had expressed to Mr. Deal “our sincere condolences for the lives taken” and promised to help Georgia. He added that he planned to reach out to Florida’s governor, Rick Scott. George Wetzel, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Peachtree City, Ga. said that in the past three days, a strong   system had moved east across the South, which had been unseasonably warm, with moisture moving north from the Gulf of Mexico. A statement from Mississippi’s emergency agency said a tornado had caused extensive damage in the southern part of the state early Saturday, killing at least four people in or near Hattiesburg and injuring more than 20 others. Gov. Phil Bryant called for a state of emergency as power lines and debris littered roads. In Georgia, an intense round of thunderstorms that started Saturday morning produced a number of tornadoes, and a second round overnight produced flooding rains, including more than six inches in 24 hours just east of Albany. A third wave of storms began in some parts of the state early Sunday. On Sunday morning in Adel, Ga. Jeff Lane, a county commissioner, surveyed the wreckage at the Sunshine Acres trailer park, where he said all of the county’s deaths had occurred. (He said eight had died, but Ms. Howden said later that the toll was actually seven.) Search and rescue crews were still making their way through the community. Photographs showed an open field surrounded by thin trees, strewn with splintered wood, metal sheeting and destroyed cars. “It’s like a bomb had been dropped out here at ground level,” Mr. Lane said by phone. “You’ve got   frames that look like spaghetti noodles. We’ve tried to evacuate as many as we can. But it’s raining real hard, and we’re getting ready to start another round of storms. ” Mr. McDowell, the pastor in Barney, a small community known for its peaches, said he had canceled Sunday services because of power failures and the continuing storms. “A lot of my people have physical damage,” he said. “Some of the roofs are ripped off, trees are down, and of course the power is off now. ” The weather also caused damage in Alabama, Louisiana and Texas, but it was not clear Sunday whether anyone had been killed or injured in those states. NOAA warned of a “high risk” of severe weather in Georgia and parts of Alabama and Florida. Since Saturday morning, 30 tornadoes were reported in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi, the agency said."
Ann Coulter is not letting Berkeley off easy," (CNN) The showdown continues between the University of California, Berkeley, and Ann Coulter over whether the conservative firebrand will speak at the famously progressive school. Citing safety concerns, administrators on Wednesday postponed Coulter’s scheduled April 27 appearance, saying it needed more time to find a ”suitable venue.”  But Coulter was not having it. In a Twitter rampage and a Fox News appearance, she accused the school of canceling the event and vowed to speak as planned. Event   Berkeley College Republicans also pushed back, saying Coulter, a ”highly sought after speaker,” could not change her schedule. Coulter’s threat to speak on April 27 ”regardless” of Berkeley’s wishes forced the school to act fast and reschedule the appearance for May 2, said Dan Mogulof, assistant vice chancellor for public affairs.  Police have very specific intelligence of threats to Coulter, attendees and protesters, UC Police Dept. Captain Alex Yao told CNN.  They said they expect a repeat of violence that   former Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos’ appearance at the school in February. Again, it seems Coulter will not play ball.  ”I’m speaking at Berkeley on April 27, as I was invited to do and have a contract to do,” she said on Twitter after Berkeley announced the May 2 date. ”GOOD NEWS FOR CA TAXPAYER! You won’t be required to pay $$$$ to compensate me  my crew for rebooked airfare  hotels. I’m speaking on  .” Coulter said the school attached a series of conditions to the April 27 appearance: She had to deliver her speech in the afternoon, only students could attend and the venue would not be announced until close to the event. She said she accepted the terms but the school called off the event anyway. The school said it was taking extra precautions in light of the Yiannopoulos protests and recent riots in the city, adding that it was ”firmly committed” to rescheduling. ”Most Mondays and Tuesdays in September during the day should work,” the school said.  Friday, Berkeley College Republicans and conservative conference organizer Young America’s Foundation    which had been trying to organize the Coulter event    rejected the May 2 proposal. They threatened legal action, saying the school’s actions violate ”fundamental principles of free speech, equal protection and due process.” In a letter from their lawyer, the organizers said the event was intended as a ”counterpoint” to a talk by Maria Echaveste, an adviser to US President Bill Clinton. The organizers said they followed protocol, acceding to the school’s ”discriminatory” conditions, only to have the event rescheduled to a time when most students would be studying for exams. The May 2 date would ”eviscerate” student access to the event, ”depriving Berkeley students of a   counterweight” to liberal viewpoints. ”It is ironic that UC Berkeley, known to many as the birthplace of the free speech movement, is now leading the vanguard to silence conservative speech on campus,” the letter read. ”Surely a public institution of higher learning should be a crucible of challenging ideas and thought, not a kindergarten where wards of the state are fed a steady diet of pasteurized pablum.” The school rejected the allegations said it would discontinue efforts to plan the May 2 event. In a letter to organizers, Berkeley’s counsel said the school had dedicated more resources to facilitating college Republican events this semester than to ”any other student group in memory.” The letter faulted organizers for failing to notify the school or seek a security review before signing its contract with Coulter. ”We are dismayed that your letter suggests a disregard of the professional judgment of law enforcement regarding security concerns,” Chief Counsel Christopher Patti wrote in the letter, ”but we stand ready to work with BCR to find a date, time and venue where its rights and campus security can be maximized.”"
"Six False Accusations by John Lewis, Hero-Turned-Hack","Rep. John Lewis ( ) is a civil rights hero. He is also one of the most partisan members of the Democratic Party, and frequently accuses his political opponents, falsely, of racism. [Lewis also uses his iconic stature to deflect criticism when he is called out for these false attacks, exploiting  —   and, arguably, demeaning  —   the civil rights movement.  Here are five of the worst recent examples of what has become, for Rep. Lewis, a shamefully routine practice. 2008: Falsely accused Sen. John McCain ( ) and Gov. Sarah Palin of racism. Lewis attacked McCain and Palin, then running against Sen. Barack Obama ( ) for president: “Sen. McCain and Gov. Palin are sowing the seeds of hatred and division,” he said, going on to suggest that the Republican ticket were creating the climate for racist terrorism. “[Democrat] George Wallace never threw a bomb   …     but he created the climate and the conditions that encouraged vicious attacks against innocent Americans   …      four little girls were killed on Sunday morning when a church was bombed in Birmingham, Alabama. ” Years later, McCain still had not forgiven him: “I’ll never forgive John Lewis,” he told AL. com in 2013. 2010: Falsely claimed that Tea Party demonstrators said the “ ” during   rally. Lewis joined several other members of the Congressional Black Caucus in claiming that a crowd of thousands of Tea Party protesters on the steps of Capitol Hill had shouted the “ ” at them when they walked through the crowd  —   apparently in the hope of provoking a reaction. “It surprised me that people are so mean and we can’t engage in a civil dialogue and debate,” Lewis claimed. But he never proved the accusation  —   and when Andrew Breitbart offered to donate $10, 000, then $100, 000, to the United Negro College Fund for any video evidence of the “” none surfaced  —   despite hundreds of cameras present. 2012: Falsely accused Republicans of wanting to take Americans back to Jim Crow. Lewis gave a speech at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina in which he recalled being beaten by white racists, along with fellow Freedom Riders, in 1961. He concluded by implying that Republicans wanted to bring back those days of blood and hatred: “Brothers and sisters, do you want to go back? Or do you want to keep America moving forward?” 2016: Falsely compared Donald Trump to George Wallace. Reviving his theme from 2008, Lewis said that Trump reminded him of the governors of the Jim Crow South and the police who let dogs loose on demonstrators: “I’ve been around a while and Trump reminds me so much of a lot of the things that George Wallace said and did   …     Sometimes I feel like I am reliving part of my past. I heard it so much growing up in the South  …    I heard it so much during the days of the civil rights movement. As a people, I just think we could do much better,” he told the Los Angeles Times in an interview. 2017: Falsely claimed Trump is “illegitimate” because of a Russian “conspiracy. ” Joining the tin foil hat brigade, Lewis claimed that Trump was a kind of “Manchurian Candidate” put in place by Russia: “I don’t see the   as a legitimate president.   …     I think there was a conspiracy on the part of the Russians, and others, that helped him get elected. ” Update: 2016: Falsely claimed Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) played no role in the civil rights movement. Lewis, a supporter of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s bid for the presidency, tried to trash Sanders’s civil rights credentials. “I never saw him. I never met him,” Lewis said. Proof later emerged of Sanders’s arrest in civil rights protests in Chicago in the 1960s.   Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

What’s next for Paul Ryan?,"Washington (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan conceded the biggest defeat of his political career Friday: Republicans have failed to repeal and replace Obamacare.  And after nearly three full months into the year, he now has to face a   a challenge that is likely to haunt his tenure as speaker for the foreseeable future: seemingly irreconcilable differences among his fellow Republicans.  ”Moving from an opposition party to a governing party comes with growing pains,” Ryan told reporters Friday. ”And well, we’re feeling those growing pains today.” The stunning setback was particularly excruciating for the    who made his name in Washington as a conservative policy wonk committed to repealing the Affordable Care Act and ascended to the powerful position of House speaker in fall 2015. The bill that too many of his fellow colleagues ultimately rejected was based on Ryan’s signature policy agenda, called ”A Better Way.”     ”I don’t know what else to say other than Obamacare is the law of the land. It’ll remain law of the land until it’s replaced,” he said. ”We’re going to be living with Obamacre for the foreseeable future.” It’s a rough reminder that life is different for Ryan now than before Trump was elected. During the Obama administration, the   House could pass message bills that would repeal Obamacare with impunity, knowing they would die in the Senate or be vetoed by the President.  ”This is how governing works when you’re in the majority. We need to get 216 people to agree with each other to write legislation. Not 210. Not 215,” Ryan said at Friday’s press conference. ”We were close but we didn’t have 216 people. That’s how legislating works.” RELATED: Dems gleeful after Obamacare victory, Even before the decision to pull the health care bill, Republican lawmakers were worried about the impact of a potential defeat.  New York Rep. Chris Collins said Friday afternoon prior to the cancellation of the vote that if the health care bill fails, it would leave a ”black eye” on his party’s ability to legislate. ”If we don’t pass this, I personally don’t think we pass a 2018 budget. We couldn’t pass a 2017 budget. So if we couldn’t pass a 2017 budget and this happens today, how are we going to pass a 2018 budget?” he said. ”And that’s the vehicle for tax reform. And if you don’t do tax reform, where does the money come from for infrastructure? That’s how critical this vote is today.”  But both Trump and Ryan say they plan to go to tax reform next. Ryan spoke alone from behind the podium, and he was not flanked by any of the Republican colleagues or White House officials who had furiously worked with him for weeks to try to get the health care legislation through the House.  And while questions are being raised about Ryan’s relationship with Trump, the two have publicly insisted that they have a healthy dialogue. The Wisconsin Republican said he had directly informed Trump that he did not have the votes, and that the President accepted his recommendation that Republicans yank the bill.  Trump publicly blamed Democrats    not the speaker    for Friday’s failure. ”I like Speaker Ryan. He worked very hard,” Trump said from the Oval Office. RELATED: Trump ready to cast blame, But it will take more than platitudes to unite his party, especially after both conservative and moderate factions demonstrated their strength this week. The GOP’s internal divisions were Ryan’s gravest challenge, and one he never came close to resolving.  Members of the conservative Freedom Caucus refused to get behind the bill, referring to leadership’s proposal as ”Obamacare Lite” that simply didn’t go far enough in gutting the law.  But when Ryan and his deputies attempted to appease that faction by offering to go further than their original bill in gutting Obamacare, that only irked the more moderate lawmakers in the House conference.  In the final days, Ryan worked around the clock to try to bridge the two factions, holding    meetings and    sessions. But the differences could not be reconciled.   ”We came really close today, but we came up short,” Ryan said at a news conference. ”I will not sugarcoat this. This is a disappointing day for us.” "
’Crooked Hillary’ Strikes Back: Trump the ’Presumptuous Nominee’ - Breitbart,"After Donald Trump coined the nickname “crooked Hillary” for Democrat frontrunner Hillary Clinton, she appears to have come up with a nickname for him, the “presumptuous nominee. ”[“Their presumptive nominee, otherwise called their presumptuous nominee,” Clinton said, referring to Republicans, “has made it really clear he basically said wages are too high in America. And that’s why he doesn’t think we need to raise the minimum wage. And I gotta tell you I ask myself all the time, who he is talking to?”  Clinton made her comment on Friday to a crowd while campaigning in Oakland, California, according to ABC News. Clinton has also called Trump a “loose cannon. ” “Donald Trump turns around and says, ‘Oh I don’t care if other countries get nuclear weapons,’” Clinton stated on Thursday while campaigning in Los Angeles. “That is the kind of risk this country cannot afford to take. That is dangerous, that’s like a loose cannon that we cannot afford, right?”"
Number of Swedish Children Wanting to Change Gender Doubling Each Year - Breitbart,"Sweden’s health minister has promised more support for gender identity clinics as it emerged that the number of children claiming to be in the wrong body has risen 100 per cent each year. [Louise Frisén, child psychiatrist at the Astrid Lindgren Children’s Hospital, told Aftonbladet that in 2016, the gender investigation team saw 197 children who were interested in ‘transitioning’ to becoming the opposite sex.  “There’s a 100 per cent increase in numbers each year, and the people we’re seeing are younger and younger and more and more children are coming at very young ages,” she said, adding that “the increase is identical on the adult side of things, too,” she said. Chief of Karolinska University Hospital’s gender identity team, Cecilia Dhejne, said the rise in children unhappy with having been born male or female reflects “greater openness” in Swedish society, but warned that resources are overstretched. “The problem in Sweden is that there’s a long wait for young people, both for initiating an investigation into their gender identity and then also for the different parts of treatment across the country after that. ” “It is worrying” said the   sexologist, cautioning that “having to wait in a queue can worsen the mental health of transgender people”. “It’s sad on an individual level when people feel bad about themselves, and on a wider level it’s much better that young people are able to get started with their lives so they can contribute to society,” said Ms. Dhejne. Sweden’s Public Health Minister Gabriel Wikström said: “It is totally unacceptable that there are deficiencies in care for transgender people at every stage of treatment. ” He told Aftonbladet the government had appointed a commission to investigate waiting times and gaps in care across the country, the results of which will be ready by October. “I believe [municipalities in Sweden] do the best they can with the resources they have, but unfortunately I think society has failed to do enough to listen to transgender people. As a result, we were not aware of the problems now being faced by that group. ” In recent years, left wing activists along with global media enterprises like National Geographic have worked hard to promote the concept of ‘transgender children’ but there is increasing evidence that gender ideology puts minors’ mental health at risk. There is also mounting evidence that children are too young to choose their gender. In June, the American College of Pediatricians released an open letter asserting that   trans children are psychologically confused. “Conditioning children into believing that a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse,” it read."
Dem Introduces Bill to Block Trump Administration from Funding U.S. Troops in Syria,"WASHINGTON D. C.  —   Rep. Barbara Lee ( ) introduced legislation on Friday that would prevent funding for U. S. boots on the ground in Syria as the fight against the Islamic State in the city of Raqqa is intensifying, including the recent deployment of U. S. Marines and Army Rangers. [“The bill I am introducing today prohibits the Department of Defense from funding any attempt by the administration to expand our presence in Syria by putting U. S. combat boots on the ground,” Rep. Barbara Lee ( .) explained in a statement to The Hill.  “It is our constitutional duty as members of Congress to place a check on the executive branch in matters of war and peace,” Lee said. Lee was the only lawmaker who voted against the authorization for the use of military force (AUMF) in the days following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that killed 3, 000 people. The AUMF has given ongoing authority to the U. S. military to continue to fight radical Islamic terror around the globe in all of its incarnations, including the Islamic State in Syria. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, a retired United States Marine Corps General who served as the 11th Commander of the United States Central Command and has experience in the Middle East, Northeast Africa, and Central Asia, said during his confirmation hearing that the campaign to retake Raqqa should be accelerated. On Thursday, Gen. Joseph Votel, commander of U. S. Central Command, confirmed the deployment in a hearing with the Senate Armed Services Committee, The Hill reported. “Our intention here with this  —   and this fell within the authorities that are provided to me right now  —   was to ensure that we had redundant capable fighters support on the ground to support our partners and ensure that we could take advantage of opportunities and ensure the continuing progress that we’ve been seeing,” Votel said. U. S. forces in Syria total 400 in addition to the 500 U. S. military personnel deployed during the Obama administration. Lee’s bill would bar the Pentagon from funding ground combat operations in Syria or hire a private security firm to do the same. The bill includes exceptions to “protect, rescue or remove” U. S. personnel, The Hill reported. Lee also attempted to impose these restrictions in the form of an amendment to the defense spending bill passed by the House on Wednesday, but the House Rules Committee blocked the amendment, The Hill reported."
Reuters: Homeland Security Employees Locked Out of Computer Networks - Breitbart,"(Reuters)  —   U. S. Department of Homeland Security employees in the Washington area were unable to access some agency computer networks on Tuesday, according to three sources familiar with the matter. [It was not immediately clear how widespread the issue was or how significantly it affected daily functions at DHS, a large government agency whose responsibilities include immigration services, border security and cyber defense.  Employees began experiencing problems logging into networks at 5 a. m. ET on Tuesday due to a problem related to the personal identify verification (PIV) cards used by federal workers and contractors to access certain information systems, one source said. At least four DHS buildings were affected, the source said, including locations used by U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Another source said the cards did not appear to be responsible. DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Read the rest of the story at Reuters."
Geller: Turkish President Says No Muslim Family Should Engage in Birth Control - Breitbart,"Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants the terrorist hatcheries to be operating at full capacity. He said Monday: “We will multiply our descendants. They talk about population planning, birth control. No Muslim family can have such an approach. Nobody can interfere in Allah’s work. The first duty here belongs to mothers. ” In the past, he has even said that using birth control was tantamount to treason.  The devout Muslim supremacist Turkish President, who styles himself the next Ottoman caliph, needs an army of vicious, mindless jihadis  —   why else would he issue this edict on birth control? The man who took down Turkey, who buried the founder of secular Turkey, Kemal Ataturk, and all that that he stood for hopes to resurrect the savage reign of the Ottoman empire. The Huffington Post ran a Reuters report on this without a hint of disapproval. They have no problem with this  —   but imagine what their reaction would have been if a Republican had said such a thing. The Express reported that “despite a decline, Turkey’s fertility rate is one of the highest in Europe and the population is just under 80 million. ” Europe is dying, from the combined effects of a low birth rate and suicidal immigration polices. What chance does it possibly have for a future? These comments from Erdogan about birth control don’t take place in a vacuum. The Turkish President has a vision for a Muslim Europe. He has devised a to bring it about and is putting that plan into very real action. Turkey was the gateway country for the unprecedented invasion of Muslims into Europe. Despite myriad attempts by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the European Union to make deals with Turkey to somehow stem the tidal wave of Muslim migrants, Erdogan flagrantly moves ahead with his battle plan. And now EU Commission President   Juncker has accused Turkey of issuing “threats” to secure   travel in Europe for its 80 million citizens. Meanwhile, Erdogan exercises increasing power in Europe. Merkel is allowing a German comedian to be prosecuted for insulting the Turkish President. This is   sharia enforcement in Merkelistan. This woman is adopting Hitlerian policies. Hitler, too, restricted speech and enforced it much the way Merkel is, i. e.   Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook to censor posts that were critical of the migrant invasion. That Zuckerberg did it shows how dangerous the power he wields really is. Merkel has gone off the rails. She has become a tool of the   caliph in Ankara. Freedom of speech is the foundation of a free society. Without it, a tyrant can wreak havoc unopposed, while his opponents are silenced. Putting up with being offended is essential in a pluralistic society in which people differ on basic truths. If a group will not bear being offended without resorting to violence, that group will rule unopposed while everyone else lives in fear, while other groups curtail their activities to appease the violent group. This results in the violent group being able to tyrannize the others. That would be fine with Erdogan. The Jerusalem Post reported in April that Erdogan said: “I am one of the first political leaders officially declaring that   is a crime. I expect an official declaration that Islamophobia is a crime against humanity as well. Islamophobia emerged from the Western countries and this is a challenge that we all together need to surmount. ” What he means is that any opposition to jihad terror should be criminalized. This is the man whom Obama called his best, most trusted friend among world leaders. Europe dismantles while rebuilding the Ottoman Empire. Turkey’s demographics, especially with Erdogan’s new edict about birth control, make Turkey into a ticking time bomb that will go off in the heart of Europe before anyone expects  —   probably while European authorities are still wringing their hands over “Islamophobia. ” Pamela Geller is the President of the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI) publisher of PamelaGeller. com and author of The   Presidency: The Obama Administration’s War on America and Stop the Islamization of America: A Practical Guide to the Resistance.

"Gaffney: Sanctuary Cities Are ‘Magnet’ for Illegals, Don’t Make Us Safer","Frank Gaffney, Center for Security Policy president, praised President Trump’s first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, on Wednesday’s Breitbart News Daily. [“He seems like a most impressive man,” Gaffney told SiriusXM host Alex Marlow.   Following a clip Marlow played, Gaffney said, “The law is not my area of expertise, needless to say  —   but he, I believe, has epitomized over his distinguished career an approach to judicial practice which that clip you just ran spoke to: that it is not the role of judges to make the law. It is to apply the law, to assure the equitable application of the law. ” “That’s a refreshing change from what we’ve been seeing a lot of from the bench, including the Supreme Court, of late,” Gaffney continued, “a necessary corrective, especially in regards to replacing one of the most eminent, most capable, and most important checks on that practice, namely Antonin Scalia, who Judge Gorsuch is being called to replace on the Supreme Court, of course. ” Marlow asked Gaffney about the spectacle of the Council on   Relations (CAIR) throwing Breitbart News reporter Neil Munro out of an event that was supposedly dedicated to “tolerance” and “inclusion. ” “A couple of quick points on this, Alex,” Gaffney said. “One, among the governments that has tied the Council on   Relations, CAIR, to terrorism is the United States government. In fact, in the Holy Land Foundation trial  —     largest terrorism financing trial in the country’s history  —   CAIR was identified by an FBI agent, based upon wiretaps conducted by the FBI back in the day when it did that sort of thing, of a meeting. It turned out to be the founding meeting of this organization CAIR, and it involved representatives of a group the Brotherhood itself has identified as a part of their organizations, the Islamic Association for Palestine, on the one hand, and representatives of Hamas. What the federal government contends in court, and four different federal judges affirmed, was that CAIR is Hamas. ” “So there’s that. And then there’s this point that you’ve made, and I think it’s apt, that the most intolerant people on the planet, bar none, are the jihadists  —   who seek often in this country, doing business as the Muslim Brotherhood, the parent organization of Hamas, including the Council on   Relations, that everybody must be very tolerant of them,” he continued. “It’s absurd. It’s obscene. And unfortunately, to the extent that these guys have gotten away with it for this long, under, I’m sorry to say, Republican and Democratic administrations, they have managed to become influential in our   process, to the point where we are largely, willfully, blind to the real threat that they represent,” he warned. “So yes, I do hope that this is another of the things that Donald Trump will attend to here shortly, namely designating the Muslim Brotherhood as what it is: a terrorist organization, which I hope will speak volumes about the Council on   Relations and other front groups operating in this country under its banner,” he said. Marlow referenced Dr. Zuhdi Jasser’s appearance on Breitbart News Daily the previous day, in which he denounced the Left’s use of Muslims as pawns in its   games. “Zuhdi’s a remarkable man, and I am very proud to have him as a friend,” Gaffney said. “I think he’s absolutely right about that. I think the corollary, of course, is that the Islamists are using the Left, as well. They’re using them as cover for what is, according to the Muslim Brotherhood’s own secret plan  —   written back in 1991 as a report to Cairo, the mothership, the headquarters, not meant for our eyes, called the ‘Explanatory Memorandum on the General Strategic Goal of the Group.’ People can go look at it, download it for free at SecureFreedom. org. It is a fascinating read. ”  “What it makes very clear is the Muslim Brotherhood’s mission in our country is destroying Western civilization from within, by the hands of what you might call the infidels,” he said. “Among the infidels that are most helpful to them, if you’re trained as I was in fighting the old Soviet Communists, think of them as ‘useful idiots’ or ‘useful infidels,’ the term that Daniel Pipes has coined. But whatever they are, they are helping the Islamists in their efforts to take us down, and the Islamists are helping the Left in doing just that. They have a very different vision of what should come next, of course, but they are making common cause.  “And it is bizarre, since among the pillars of the Left, let’s recall, are groups like feminists  —   as we saw in the streets of Washington and elsewhere recently  —   and Jews, and homosexuals, and people of various minority faiths, people who leave their faiths. These are all, especially Muslims, regarded as, you know, the enemy by this   ‘Religion of Peace. ’” he pointed out. “I want to emphasize, there are people like Zuhdi Jasser who don’t agree with this, that don’t practice sharia, as we’ve talked about often, that animates this very intolerant, misogynistic, and   and     program of the Islamists. But it is really appalling that the Left is helping, in so many ways, normalize and socialize and otherwise advance this toxically   agenda. It’s what we see, of course, most immediately in this effort by Donald Trump to stop  —   these are my words, but I think this is what it is, at the end of the day  —   to stop importing more jihadists into the United States. The vast majority of the American people support it,” Gaffney said. Marlow moved to the subject of President Trump’s executive order on immigration by playing a comment from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to the effect that “sanctuary cities” enhance American security because they attract a large number of illegal aliens who can serve as confidential informants to the police when other illegal aliens commit crimes. “I think what we’re watching is an effort to defy common sense,” Gaffney commented. “Most of us who have common sense recognize that bringing more people into this country who aren’t just violent jihadists who want to blow things up, or shoot people, or rape people for that matter  …    I’m just worried, frankly, as I said earlier, about the people who have been engaged in what I think of as kind of ‘ ’: the sharia supremacists who seek to build the infrastructure that supports a violent kind of jihad, that insists that people don’t assimilate into our country, don’t become like Zuhdi Jasser, part of the American fabric and dream. ”  “They’re a problem, and we don’t need more of them,” he contended. “I think that’s what Donald Trump is trying to do with his pause and trying to assess how do we enhance our vetting process? How do we keep those kinds of people out?” Gaffney said that goal was “eminently sensible” and scoffed at the efforts of people like Pelosi to “cast themselves as the people who are protecting us by preventing the police from being able to identify and remove folks as part of an overall   effort, who are engaged in that kind of behavior. ” “To suggest that somehow we’re all going to be safer if we actually keep the magnet for people coming here illegally  —   some of whom, I have to say, are engaged in probably actual or   activity  —   this is a ridiculous position to strike,” he said. “I think Donald Trump is absolutely right to insist that we shut down these sanctuary cities, that we insist that our cities and our states enforce the law, not undermine it to possibly great detriment of public safety and even the national security. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.

Shooter Attacks Turkish Journalist on Trial for Anti-Erdogan Report,"Cumhuriyet’s    Can Dündar, was on trial for authorizing a report seen as unfavorable to Turkey’s ruling government. On Friday afternoon, an assailant ran towards him, shooting and shouting the word “traitor!” as Dündar was walking out of the courthouse. [Leaving Istanbul’s Çağlayan courthouse on Friday and offering comment to assembled journalists there, Dündar narrowly escaped being shot and killed by a man later identified as Murat Şahin. Dündar, his attorneys, and others involved in the case were loitering outside the courthouse during a break in proceedings. Dündar’s wife confirmed that the shooter approached the editor and called him a “traitor” before shooting and being immediately apprehended. A journalist on the scene identified as Yağız Şenkal of NTV was wounded in the leg, according to the newspaper Hurriyet.  Videos have surfaced showing different angles of the incident  —   one, a live report interrupted by the ensuing scuffle behind the reporter, and the other a video of Şahin surrendering to police in front of Dündar.

We know who painted us as a target. I hope they take lessons. ” Dündar and Cumhuriyet’s Ankara bureau editor, Erdem Gul, are on trial for publishing a report in which the newspaper alleged that Turkey’s intelligence agency, the MIT, was arming rebels opposed to dictator Bashar   in Syria, some allied to jihadist groups including the Islamic State. The report was careful not to specify which jihadist groups, only that “security forces stopped a convoy that appeared to be shipping weapons to Syria in early 2014,” later identified to have ties to the MIT. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused the newspaper of being a propaganda outlet for Fethullah Gülen, a U. S.  Islamic cleric Erdogan has branded a national villain, and vowed that the editors responsible for the report will “pay a heavy price. ” Both editors were sentenced to five years in prison shortly after the assassination attempt. Following the incident, Hüseyin Kocabıyık, a legislator belonging to Erdogan’s Islamist Justice and Development Party (AKP) tweeted that the shooting was a “fake assassination scenario. ” He added, “I’ve never seen or heard of such a fraud,” though he did not provide evidence for his theory that Dündar personally staged the shooting. Cumhuriyet is a     publication that has struggled to publish freely under Erdogan. In January 2015, the magazine was raided by police after announcing it would publish a   inset version of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, following a jihadist shooting at its Paris headquarters that left much of its senior staff dead. Two journalists who used Charlie Hebdo cartoons to illustrate their articles were sentenced to two years in prison in May. Its    and senior Ankara editor were arrested in November 2015."

Democrats open to more border security money ," (CNN) Top congressional Democrats have strongly pushed back against approving any money for President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall with Mexico as part of a   government funding bill.  At the same time, Democratic leaders restated their openness Monday to providing some money for other types of border security improvements, suggesting a possible way out of the contentious standoff. Facing a Friday deadline to keep the government open, congressional and administration negotiators are searching for ways to resolve their differences over what was a central campaign promise of Trump’s. Notably, Republicans on the Hill and many top White House officials are not outright demanding that a down payment on the border wall    which could cost tens of billions of dollars over time    be made now.    Providing some money for border security    personnel or equipment designed to crack down on illegal crossings    but not for the wall itself, could provide a   way for both sides to end for now their dispute on the issue and could clear the way for the massive government bill to pass both chambers ahead of Friday. WH officials: Busy week, but no health care vote or shutdown, For instance, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin speaking in the White House briefing room Monday declined to say if the President would insist on border wall funding in a final bill saying only that ”the President is working hard to keep the government open and addressing various issues.” And when Press Secretary Sean Spicer was asked if Trump specifically expected there to be funding for the border wall in the funding bill, he didn’t lay down the gauntlet and instead replied, ”I don’t want to get ahead of the negotiations they are ongoing. But the President’s priorities have been very clear from the beginning.” Knowing they face unified opposition to the wall by Democrats, Republicans in the administration may now be getting the message that even Hill GOP members have been telegraphing throughout the negotiations    it’s not worth risking a shut down over the controversial issue.   ”It is a divisive issue,” Rep. Mike Coffman, a Republican from a swing district in Colorado, said in an interview on CNN.  ”I certainly support securing the border but I also support keeping the government open and I think this would cause the kind of showdown that would lead to a shutdown.” Despite these signals of a willingness to compromise by GOP negotiators, the President may be undermining their efforts    or at least sending mixed messages    by blasting out tweets, touting the wall. Trump administration full of mixed messages ahead of shutdown fight, ”The Wall is a very important tool in stopping drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth (and many others)!  If the wall is not built, which it will be, the drug situation will NEVER be fixed the way it should be!” Trump wrote Monday on Twitter. A senior Democratic aide familiar with the negotiations complained that the two sides on Capitol Hill continue to make progress, but Trump administration officials are the ones interjecting and holding things up, refusing to respond to an offer from Democrats on Capitol Hill to accept a package that includes more money for border security efforts, but does not include any resources to construct a wall.  ”Congressional Republicans appear frustrated by the   White House interventions, which have undermined their ability to achieve an agreement,” the aide told CNN. ”Speaker (Paul) Ryan and Leader McConnell will need to step up and get involved in the process directly in order to move the ball forward at this stage.” RELATED: Bipartisan group wants clean spending bill to avoid shutdown, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democratic member of the Senate budget committee, said in an interview on CNN’s ”Erin Burnett OutFront” that he was fine with including some money to support border security, but chastised Trump over failing to live up to his campaign promise to make Mexico pay for the wall. ”Border security is fine,” Hollen said. ”Wasting taxpayer dollars on a wall? No.” Van Hollen also stressed that the onus of any shutdown would be on the Republican Party, saying that Trump sounded like ”an extortionist” to demand funding for his wall in the shadow of a government shutdown. ”Republicans have the White House,” Hollen said. ”They have both houses of Congress. I think it’s going to be a big mistake for them to shut down the government because the President couldn’t get Mexico to pay for the wall. . .. He told the American people that we wouldn’t have to waste our money on the wall.” In a conference call with reporters, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi,   criticized Trump’s late push for some funding for the wall now, which she said would be wrong if it was budgeted for at the expense of government programs like those that help young people, the elderly and the environment.  ”He did not promise that he would take food out of the mouths of babies and seniors and education, clean air, clean water, scientific research off the table in a significant way in order for him to pay for his immoral, ineffective, unwise proposal of a wall,” Pelosi said.   But she said she was open to some technology and other improvements at the border so long as they were not related in any way to the planning, prepping or building of the wall itself.   Welcome to the biggest week of Donald Trump’s presidency, ”So yes, if we have needs for the technology or the rest to help protect our border, let’s see what that is,” she said. ”Our appropriators were well on a path to resolving their differences and finding their common ground, respecting each other’s priorities until the White House intervened.” Democrats have publicly expressed support for more resources for border security as the two sides have worked on the   funding measure. Since this package rolls together all the spending bills for various agencies they want to show that they back what many Americans views as a national security issue. But their earlier backing has been for the bipartisan process that appropriators have been working on    not any talk about helping Trump pay for a wall that he argued Mexico would ultimately pay for during the 2016 campaign.   While the President may be working now to add something to show progress on the issue as he nears the   mark of his tenure in office, Democrats on the Hill are making it clear it’s a nonstarter. RELATED: These are the   accomplishments Trump is touting, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump had thrown a ”monkey wrench” into the sensitive budget talks when the White House demanded last week that border money be included in the government spending bill. Schumer said if Trump left congressional negotiators to cut a deal they could meet the Friday deadline.   ”In my view if the President stepped out of it, we could get a budget done Friday,” Schumer said. Schumer urged Republicans to push the debate on the wall to a future bill even though he doesn’t think it will pass then.  ”We believe the Republican leaders should tell Donald Trump we can do this at a later time. I don’t think it will pass,” Schumer said ”So instead of risking shutdown by shoving this wall down Congress’s and the American people’s throats, the President ought to let us come to an agreement and we’re happy to debate this wall in regular order down the road once he has a plan. There is not a plan now.” Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the   Senate Republican, opposes Trump’s plan for a massive wall all the way across the border. But he does support building some physical barriers as called for by the Secure Fence Act, a 2006 law that was supported by many Democrats including Schumer. ”I think border security is important and certainly completing or at least making a down payment on something they’ve already voted for and supported seems to me to be kind of a ” Cornyn told reporters in the Capitol explaining that that there are still about 100 miles of the flexible fencing to be funded and built. Cornyn was asked if that approach would save face for Democrats who could say they didn’t fund the ”wall” and save face for Republicans who can say they boosted border security. ”It sounds like everybody is looking to save face in one way or another. I don’t really think that kind of posturing is necessary,” he said. ”I think they ought to just do our job, which is to fund the government through the end of the fiscal year and quit looking for reasons not to do so.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, welcoming senators back from a   recess, said bipartisan talks were continuing but stopped short of predicting when a deal might be reached. ”Bipartisan talks continued through the state work period on the way forward on government funding legislation,” the Kentucky Republican said. ”Those discussions continue this week so we can complete our work on that issue very soon.” Negotiators are still working through issues on legislation that would wrap all the spending bills for the last five months on this fiscal year into one ”omnibus” package. The fight over border wall money emerged as the most contentious issue, especially after Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, floated an idea to link one dollar of Obamacare subsidy money to one dollar of border wall funding, a proposal flatly rejected by Democrats.   Aides from both parties appear confident that remaining policy issues can be resolved, but leaders from either side will need to brief    members on any deal before moving ahead with votes before the deadline, and both agree they may need a stopgap bill to avoid any disruption of funding. Pelosi and Schumer spoke on a conference call with Tom Perez, the Democratic National Committee chairman, that was designed to discuss Trump’s first 100 days in office.  "
"Statistical Tie in Michigan Poll: Donald Trump Catching Hillary Clinton, and 13 Percent Undecided - Breitbart","Thirteen percent of Michigan’s likely voters have not picked their candidate yet, even as Donald Trump has powered up to 4 points behind Hillary Clinton in the Democratic firewall state, according to a new poll from the Detroit Free Press. [That massive “Don’t know” response from one in seven voters comes as a pair of tracking polls shows Trump three points behind Clinton or level.  The Free Press poll’s huge “Don’t know” number may reflect voters’ dislike of both candidates, or an unwillingness to openly admit support for Trump. A recent test by Morning Consult, for example, shows that an estimated 7 percent of college graduates hide their support for Trump by telling   pollsters that they support Clinton.  If Trump wins in Michigan, he’ll get the 270th Electoral Vote he needs to become president, providing he also wins the states where he’s now edging Clinton. Both sides are rushing surrogates into the state help push up their support and to get their voters to the polls. President Barack Obama won the state’s 16 Electoral Votes by 9. 4 percentage points in 2012. The Free Press poll was released Friday, and it shows Clinton at 42 percent and Trump at 38 percent. According to the newspaper:  Hillary Clinton is hanging onto a narrow   lead over Donald Trump in Michigan heading into the last weekend before Tuesday’s election, with a new Free Press poll showing clear momentum for the Republican nominee in a state that several weeks ago was believed all but decided for the Democrat. The poll, done exclusively for the Free Press by   of Lansing, shows Clinton’s support steady at 42%  —   up a point from where it was late last month. But it also clearly shows Republicans and some independents rallying around Trump in the waning days of the campaign season, with his support up four points from two weeks ago to 38%. Meanwhile, the number of undecided voters  —   13%  —   remains extraordinarily high for this late in an election cycle, The poll interviewed 600 likely voters, and it has a   margin of error, meaning there’s a 95 percent chance that each result is actually within 4 points of the true number.  Also tracking poll by Fox 2 in Detroit showed Trump 3 points behind Clinton on Nov. 2 and Nov. 3. The poll was conducted by the Mitchell Poll of Michigan and quizzed 1, 150 likely voters, and concluded: In the   ballot question that includes Libertarian Party candidate former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, it is Clinton 47%  —   Trump 44%  —   Johnson 4%  —   Stein 3% while 2% are undecided   …     The percentages are almost exactly the same as they were the night before.  “Clinton’s weakness with 65 and older white women continued again last night and Trump maintained his small lead with men,” said a statement from Steve Mitchell, the CEO of Mitchell Research  Communications. The firm’s Nov. 2 and Nov. 3 tracking polls showed how: Clinton did take back most of the support she lost with Democrats on Tuesday night.  Although she stanched the bleeding, Clinton’s problems are taking a toll on her candidacy in Michigan and the state is now in play.  That is likely the reason we have we have seen most of the Trump family including the candidate in Michigan along with former President Bill Clinton.  Tomorrow, Hillary Clinton will be in town campaigning, more evidence of a close race. The Mitchell poll has a error margin of 2. 89 percent, meaning each of the numbers may vary by 2. 89 percent. On Nov. 2, a GOP polling firm, Strategic National, showed a gap of only 1 point in its poll of 500 Likely Voters in Michigan. The poll records Clinton’s support at 45 percent, while Trump’s support climbed to 44 percent. On Nov. 3, Trump drew level with Clinton, according to John Yob, CEO of the Strategic National polling firm. “Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are tied in Michigan and we truly have a dead heat going into the final weekend,” Yob said in a statement to Breitbart News.  Trump is over performing in key segments of the electorate especially in rural areas and Macomb County while Clinton is failing to get the numbers she needs out of the city of Detroit.  Michigan is likely to be very busy this weekend and could be the state that determines the next President of the United States.  Republicans have come a long way since Mitt Romney lost it by nearly 10 points just four years ago. The poll’s error margin is 4. 4 percent, meaning each of the numbers in the poll could be 4. 4 percent high or lower. Currently, the Real Clear Politics polling site shows Clinton safely in the lede, with a 5. 4 percent gap in a   race and a 4. 6 percent advantage over Trump in a   race."

Comparing Trump’s inauguration crowd to the Women’s March,"Washington (CNN) It’s going to be impossible to gauge how many people exactly attended the inauguration of Donald Trump in 2017 as opposed to Barack Obama in 2009.  It’s also going to be impossible to gauge how many people exactly attended Trump’s inauguration as opposed to the Women’s March Saturday organized as a direct rebuttal to Trump the previous day. RELATED: Get full coverage of the transition to Trump and of the Women’s March, But there’s going to be a lot of conjecture about it. Trump himself talked about his massive crowds during an appearance at the Armed Services Ball Friday night.  It’s clear that both events attracted many people. Below are pictures from 12:15 p. m. ET on each day from the EarthCam website.  Trump talked about crowd size during an appearance at the CIA Saturday and argued the size of his crowds had been misrepresented. ”We had a massive field of people,” he told the US intelligence agency. ”You saw that. Packed. I get up this morning, I turn on one of the networks, and they show an empty field. I’m like, wait a minute. I made a speech. I looked out, the field was, it looked like a million, million and a half people. They showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there. And they said, Donald Trump did not draw well,” the President said. ”It looked honestly like a million and a half people, whatever it was, it was, but it went all the way back to the Washington Monument and I turn on, by mistake, I get this network, and it showed an empty field. Said we drew 250, 000 people. Now, that’s not bad. But it’s a lie. We had 250, 000 people,” he said.  It wasn’t clear which outlet Trump was referring to. CNN has not reported a specific size to the crowd since there has been no official estimate. Trump took the oath of office just before noon Friday and then gave his inaugural address. A rally associated with the march was slated for between 10 a. m. and 1 p. m. on Saturday. Some differences to note: Trump’s speech was on the West Front of the Capitol, which was at capacity on Friday. It was cordoned off and empty on Saturday as protesters gathered on the Mall.  On the other hand, the Women’s March filled the streets around the mall. Those streets were closed to Trump supporters. His inauguration was on Jan. 20, because of the Constitution, which this year occurred on a Friday. The Women’s March was on Saturday, when more people are off work. Metro, Washington’s subway system, tweeted Saturday there were 275, 000 trips taken Saturday by 11 a. m.   On Friday, there were 193, 000 trips by 11 a. m. according to Metro. Another important point: Both events are occurring in an area opposed to Trump. Washington, D. C. voted overwhelmingly against Trump last November. He got just 4. 1% of the vote in the nation’s capital. He also lost the surrounding states of Maryland by 25 percentage points and Virginia by nearly 5 percentage points. It would be a longer trip for a critical mass of Trump supporters than for a critical mass of marchers. It should also be noted that marchers took to the streets in other cities, nationwide, and in cities around the world.

Let It Go Go Go! Three Stage Versions of ‘Frozen’ Are on the Way - The New York Times,"In 1957, Walt Disney laid out what was then an astonishing plan for an entertainment ecosystem: Animated movies would fuel theme park attractions, which in turn would power merchandise sales, which would create interest in more movies. Today, with “Frozen,” the plan has evolved further. When the movie became a blockbuster in 2013, taking in $1. 3 billion globally, Disney got busy: It rushed out merchandise, sent Princesses Anna and Elsa on an   tour and started work on an Arendelle boat ride at Epcot and three stage musicals. Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, told a Wall Street conference last month that he had recently seen a “Frozen” show bound for Disney California Adventure. He noted that “Frozen” would be part of the parade at the new Shanghai Disneyland. And, he said, “I sat on Friday here in New York in a   of the ‘Frozen’ musical that we’re starting to develop for Broadway. ” It’s an increasingly familiar approach: Both “Beauty and the Beast” and “Aladdin” had theme park shows before New York productions. (Broadway veterans helped create them all.) Keeping all the efforts untangled can be challenging. Is the theme park show a miniversion of the Broadway one? What about the Disney Cruise Line production? Here’s what we know about the   versions of “Frozen” underway: DIRECTOR Liesl Tommy. Raised in South Africa, she tends to pursue   projects about civil and political rights. Ms. Tommy is a Tony nominee for her direction of “Eclipsed,” a searing play, starring Lupita Nyong’o, about captive women in Liberia. Her musical credits include “Party People,” a regional show about the Black Panther movement. OTHER TEAM MEMBERS “Frozen  —   Live at the Hyperion,” as the   theater here is named, uses the film’s score, but some songs initially written as solos (“In Summer”) were rearranged by Jason Michael Webb (“The Color Purple”) to become ensemble numbers. Chad Beguelin, the   author of the book for Disney’s “Aladdin” on Broadway, adapted the “Frozen” book from the film’s screenplay. Video elements, and there are a ton of them, were handled by Aaron Rhyne (“A Gentleman’s Guide to Love  Murder”). STATUS It began an   run on May 27 and has up to five performances daily. The Hyperion was home to “Aladdin  —   A Musical Spectacular,” which ran for 13 years. CAST More than 100 actors, dancers and puppeteers are involved (about 3, 500 auditioned) but Disney declined to identify any by name. With so many daily performances, a spokesman explained, numerous performers share the lead roles. (Disney also, ahem, takes the suspension of disbelief to an extreme at its theme parks: As an usher told a child before a recent performance, Anna and Elsa are real and played by themselves.) RUNNING TIME 55 minutes AUDIENCE The    masses. Everyone from babies to older adults took in a recent performance, with a handful of people in prime seats holding up their phones to videotape the opening number. “There’s going to be a lot of people who have never seen theater before,” Ms. Tommy said in an interview. COST TO ATTEND Ostensibly free. But the Hyperion is inside Disney California Adventure, one of two theme parks that make up the Disneyland Resort. Admission to California Adventure is $95 to $119, depending on the day. HOW IT DIFFERS FROM THE FILM “It’s 10 times better than the movie,” a Disney usher named Yvonne (from Lakewood, Calif. according to her name badge) told guests as they waited in line for nearly an hour for a recent performance. Some film fans may disagree. Some songs are abbreviated and ancillary scenes and characters are cut. There is no Marshmallow (the ice monster) for instance, and Anna does not wander into Wandering Oaken’s Trading Post and Sauna. How it differs from other ‘Frozen’ adaptations A lot more bells and whistles. “People are coming in here full of adrenaline, they’ve been on rides,” Ms. Tommy said. “How do I top that?” There’s a lavish    video wall, a sequence in which Sven the reindeer literally flies, and lots of fake fog. ‘Let It Go’ Moment Hold on tight: Elsa belts it out while standing atop a towering set of crystal stairs that rotates out over the audience. DIRECTOR Alex Timbers. An unconventionally witty theater director known for his steampunk aesthetic, he has twice been nominated for Tony Awards, for directing Disney’s “Peter and the Starcatcher” and for writing the book for “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson. ” OTHER TEAM MEMBERS Music and lyrics by Kristen   and Robert Lopez, who wrote the film’s score, and a book by Jennifer Lee, who wrote the screenplay and directed the film. The set design is by Bob Crowley, who has won multiple Tony Awards, including for Disney’s “Aida” and “Mary Poppins. ” STATUS A developmental lab (two weeks in which actors, accompanied by keyboards and drums, read and sang, using scripts on music stands, before an invited audience that at one point included Mr. Iger) was held in New York last month. A   run is planned at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts in August 2017, and Disney said that it planned to move the show to Broadway in the spring of 2018. CAST At the developmental lab, Betsy Wolfe (“Bullets Over Broadway”) played Elsa, Patti Murin (“Lysistrata Jones”) was Anna, Okieriete Onaodowan (“Hamilton”) was Kristoff and Greg Hildreth (“Cinderella”) was Olaf. Although actors often remain with productions from the developmental process through full productions, Disney has not committed to casting for the Denver production that cast would likely continue on to Broadway. RUNNING TIME Two full acts, presumably running two to two and a half hours. AUDIENCE The Broadway audience is older than that at the theme parks most ticketbuyers are women. Disney’s shows attract more families with children than do some more   Broadway shows, but the company says its shows also draw many adults without children. COST TO ATTEND Prices have not been set, but   tickets to “The Lion King” on Broadway are $99 to $199, with premium seats for up to $225. HOW IT DIFFERS FROM FILM Live actors, obviously. An expanded story and an expanded song list  —   there are eight (and a reprise) in the film, and this production will probably have at least twice that. Among the new songs is “True Love,” an Act II ballad sung by Anna after Hans, a scheming prince, betrays her and locks her in a palace room. HOW IT DIFFERS FROM OTHER ‘FROZEN’ ADAPTATIONS The Broadway version is the only one with new songs and new book material. It will be the most fully realized and ambitious theatrical production. ‘LET IT GO’ MOMENT The song, thanks to its soaring sound and stratospheric popularity, is now the first act’s closing number. DIRECTOR Sheryl Kaller, whose Broadway credits include “Mothers and Sons,” in 2014, and “Next Fall,” which earned her a Tony nomination in 2010. OTHER TEAM MEMBERS Disney has not publicly confirmed this production, but casting notices this year said that Josh Prince, whose Broadway dance résumé includes “Beautiful: The Carole King Musical” and the   “Shrek the Musical,” would be the choreographer. STATUS Still in the early stages. There has been at least one   but this musical is planned for the   cruise ship Wonder, which is headed to dry dock this year for refurbishment. CAST With limited living quarters for performers, Disney’s ships often look for people who can simultaneously play a range of characters. But the casting notice for this effort included some specific requirements. For the role of Kristoff, for instance, Disney advertised for a baritone who stands six feet tall or more and can play a “rugged   type, a little rough around the edges, yet endearingly awkward. ” RUNNING TIME The show that will likely be replaced, “Toy Story  —   The Musical,” runs about an hour in the Wonder’s   theater. (Or “glitzy   theater palace at sea,” if you’re going by the Disney Cruise Line website.) AUDIENCE Disneyphiles. While intended to appeal to a wide range of travelers, guests tend to be well acquainted with Disney’s singular style of entertainment, and that means any efforts to cut corners are noticed. COST TO ATTEND Included with the price of passage, which starts at $507 a person (plus port fees and taxes) for a     Bahamian cruise. HOW IT DIFFERS FROM FILM Like the theme park version, this will be about presenting what’s in the movie  —   in   fashion  —   for already captive crowds. HOW IT DIFFERS FROM OTHER ‘FROZEN’ ADAPTATIONS Disney Cruise Line, which mounts its stage productions without much interaction with its corporate siblings, bills its musicals as “ . ” Marketing pitches aside, this show will almost certainly be the least extravagant. ‘LET IT GO’ MOMENT You can bet that the climactic scene will include fake snow. Choose your seat wisely."
"White House: Trump’s Carrier Deal Saved 1,000 Jobs Obama Saved Over a Million Manufacturing Jobs - Breitbart","The White House appeared unimpressed by the news that Carrier had decided not to move 1, 000 manufacturing jobs to Mexico, after negotiating with   Donald Trump about keeping the jobs in Indiana. [White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest admitted that Carrier’s decision appeared to be “good news” but pointed out that Obama had done a better job at creating and saving jobs.  “If he is successful in doing that 804 more times, then he will meet the record of manufacturing jobs that were created in the United States while President Obama was in office,” he said. Earnest pointed out that under Obama, 805, 000 manufacturing jobs were created in the United States. He also boasted that Obama had saved over a million jobs during his presidency by bailing out the auto industry. “President Obama has set a high standard, and   Trump can meet that standard, if this Carrier deal is completed in the way that he expects that it will be,” he said. “If he does that 804 more times, then he will match the standard established by Obama. ”"
Pamela Geller: Megyn Kelly Says ’No Question’ That I’m a ’Hateful Person’ - Breitbart,"In hitting   Trump and supposedly defending the freedom of speech, Megyn Kelly on NPR Wednesday night referred to “Pam [sic] Geller, who there’s no question is a hateful person, who held this Draw Muhammad contest down in Texas. ”[Kelly said this in the context of defending the freedom of speech: “Now she’s a provocateur and she’s not a fan of anyone who’s Muslim from the sound of what she says, but this is America and she has the right to say those things. And she has the right to have a contest like that. ” But in smearing me as “hateful,” she demonstrates that she doesn’t really know what was at stake when Islamic jihadis attacked our free speech event in Garland.  Why am I hateful for standing for the First Amendment? Is she copying the tactics of Islamic propagandists, smearing as “hateful” those of us who refuse to submit to the most brutal and extreme ideology on the face of the earth? And I’m a “provocateur”? Why? The Garland attack was part of a longstanding jihad war against the freedom of speech. Those who say I provoked the jihadis don’t remember, or care to remember, that as jihadis were killing the Muhammad cartoonists in Paris, their accomplice was murdering Jews in a nearby kosher supermarket. Were the Jews “hateful”? Did they “provoke” the jihadis? I held the event in the same venue where Muslim leaders held a conference in support of the sharia, in support of the ideology behind the Charlie Hebdo jihad massacre. Was that provocative? Should we submit to the devout Muslims who use violence to impose the speech laws under the sharia? Drawing Muhammad offends Islamic jihadists? So does being Jewish, as many   attacks have proven. How much accommodation of any kind should we give to murderous savagery? To kowtow to violent intimidation will only encourage more of it. Megyn Kelly should know that. What does Megyn Kelly know about my work as a whole? What did she do to help Rifqa Bary, the Ohio teenager who was threatened with death by her father for converting from Islam to Christianity? What has Megyn Kelly done for the other Muslim girls who wanted to live a free life, and whom I helped to safety? Megyn Kelly has never had me on her show. She covered the jihad attack against our free speech event in Texas for over a week but did not have me on. How does she know what I think, or why I did what I did? She made her “stand” for free speech regarding the Garland jihad attack while excoriating me. The thing about Kelly is that she assumed my mantle and championed my work while attacking and smearing me that is the hallmark of a true  . Meanwhile, the scallywags, scoundrels, and misanthropes to whom she gives a platform on her show are reprehensible. Kelly has oppressors and   operatives on her show, including representatives of the   Council on American (CAIR). The lovefest between Megyn Kelly and Michael Moore pulled the curtain back on the RINO news network. It was jarring. Ever since Megyn Kelly got her mancut haircut (emulating iconic female TV personality Diane Sawyer) she has seemingly been on a mission to move to the alphabets (ABC, NBC, CBS). Sadly, Rupert Murdoch’s   sons, Tweedledee and Tweedledum (who took over after Roger Ailes was stupidly forced out) have made complete asses of themselves furiously trying to keep her. They have offered her over 20 million dollars a year. Why? She has alienated the Fox News audience by attacking Trump and shamelessly trying to curry favor with   news executives at the big three. The auction for her services never materialized, and Kelly has kicked it up several notches, making her show unwatchable. The good news? Hannity has skyrocketed, pulling even with her in the ratings and at times surpassing her. I hope her ego gets the better of her and she goes. She will go down with that ship. We saw what happened when FOX gave her a special on the FOX Network. She bombed. Drop Kelly and replace her with Tomi Lahren. Two birds, one stone. We the people get our kind of gal, and the Murdoch idiots get a millennial icon.

LA Times: Milo Says Twitter Ban Is ’The Most Gigantic Possible Gift’ - Breitbart,"From David Ng writing at the Los Angeles Times:  Conservative lightning rod Milo Yiannopoulos was in high spirits late Tuesday night just hours after he learned that he had been permanently banned from Twitter. “Are you kidding? This is the most gigantic possible gift!” the Breitbart News senior editor said by phone from Cleveland, where he was attending the Republican National Convention. He contended that his ban was politically motivated and represents a threat to free speech.   …     Yiannopolous sees his permanent ban as a political move by Twitter. “There’s a systemic bias against conservatives and libertarians [on Twitter],” he said. “The progressive press is going to take their side, dishonestly suggesting that I was making life difficult for a black woman. ” He added: “This is a political decision. With this they are sending a message to conservatives that they’re not welcome on Twitter. ” Read the rest of the story at the Los Angeles Times."
Chelsea Clinton May Be Willing to Lend a Hand if Her Mother Wins - The New York Times,"PHILADELPHIA  —   Bill Clinton does not know his way around a china pattern. He is unlikely, friends said, to dwell on the trimmings of the White House Christmas tree. And if he is still smooth at small talk when he must be, happy to riff on sports and science until the last guest has left, the staid ceremonial duties of a presidential spouse do not hold much appeal. With this in mind, old family hands have gravitated toward a typical Clintonian solution should the former president find himself as first gentleman in 2017: Perhaps the first daughter could help. Just as she assumed a lead role in her father’s foundation and became a chief campaign surrogate for her mother, Chelsea Clinton is willing to step up should her parents need her if they return to the White House, according to the former first daughter’s friends. She is the third partner in the family business of being Clintons, and Ms. Clinton’s bond with her parents, so familiar to Americans from her adolescence in the 1990s, was on display once more on Thursday. One week after Ivanka Trump served as her father’s chief character witness at the Republican gathering in Cleveland, Ms. Clinton introduced her mother at the convention inside the Wells Fargo Center, making the case for Hillary Clinton’s compassion and maternal touch. “That feeling of being valued and loved  —   that’s what my mom wants for every child,” she told the crowd. “It is the calling of her life. ” Mrs. Clinton’s historic nomination has already scrambled the established political family order, compelling Mr. Clinton on Tuesday night to deliver his own take on a traditional   speech: a former president producing a humanizing, if airbrushed, portrait of a partner and a parent. Clinton advisers say that Chelsea Clinton’s influence and involvement in a prospective administration have not been given much thought. But they also say that Ms. Clinton is likely to lend a hand around major events and holidays, at least by phone and email, and to help her father with some of the traditional duties of a president’s spouse. “She has a deep bond with them, and she knows that she can be a lot of help to them if they return to the White House,” said Thomas F. McLarty III, known as Mack, a close friend of the Clintons and a former chief of staff to Mr. Clinton. “Chelsea is so substantive, and has two young children, that I don’t see her playing White House social secretary. But I do think she will chip in to help her father and mother with managing life in the White House. ” Given that the spousal role often comes down to what the person makes of it, Mr. Clinton has some freedom to rethink the job, and Mrs. Clinton has signaled that she would want him to play a policy role. But the Clintons are also sensitive to not giving short shrift to the influence that first ladies have had, and advisers to the couple say that the three Clintons, as a family, will discuss ways to carry out that role. Betty Ford arguably had more   impact on American life, by easing stigmas on breast cancer and alcoholism, than her   husband did. Jackie Kennedy and Nancy Reagan defined style for many women of their generations. Lady Bird Johnson remains deeply admired as a symbol of strength and loyalty to her husband. So does Eleanor Roosevelt, who became a political force in her own right. Hillary Clinton redefined the role of first lady by taking on a policy role on health care  —   failing on the goal of national health insurance but succeeding with congressional allies to enact the federal children’s health insurance programs. And Michelle Obama has been a significant role model for women of color and a particular inspiration for young black girls in   communities. But any suggestion that Chelsea Clinton might be relied upon to perform traditional   tasks has the potential to strike a nerve, prompting concerns about an overly gendered view of presidential family roles. And such a role might seem incongruent with Ms. Clinton’s graduate degrees from Oxford and Columbia and her career in business consulting and nonprofit management. But friends of Ms. Clinton say she would never be offended if her parents asked her for help. Her mother, after all, was a Yale Law School star and accomplished lawyer when she threw herself into the role of first lady in the 1990s. Ms. Clinton is 36  —   on the millennial borderline  —   seasoned enough to headline panels on global health and women’s rights and young enough, particularly in her mother’s orbit of   supporters, to serve as an ambassador of sorts to   skeptical of the Clinton name. She has two children, Charlotte, almost 2, and a    Aidan. She will not be moving back into the White House. “I honestly think she’s trying to get through the convention,” said Elizabeth Weindruch, a childhood friend from Little Rock, Ark. stressing that Ms. Clinton had not determined what she hoped to focus on after the election. It was a heady week for Ms. Clinton, preparing to address the convention 24 years after joining her parents, as not quite yet a teenager, in New York for her father’s nomination. In 1992, she grinned through orthodontic braces, played cards with friends and sustained a minor sightseeing injury. (She got leg cramps racing up the steps at the Statue of Liberty with Ms. Weindruch.) “We were just kids running around New York,” Ms. Weindruch said Wednesday, en route to Philadelphia to be with Ms. Clinton once more. Ms. Clinton’s schedule this week was at least as busy. On Tuesday night, perched in a box beside her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, and Senator Elizabeth Warren, Ms. Clinton choked up throughout her father’s speech. He recalled the evening of her birth, the time they watched a “Police Academy” marathon, the day he dropped her off at college (Stanford) as Mrs. Clinton spread liner paper across a drawer. On Wednesday, Ms. Clinton held forth on gay rights and voter outreach at a lunch for the Human Rights Campaign, earning two standing ovations and telling the crowd that she had been straining to suppress tears all week. An attendee, John Klenert, said he had watched Ms. Clinton grow up. He “felt sorry for her” in her youth, he said, marveling at her evolution now. And he chafed, unprompted, at grumblings that Ms. Clinton should assist her mother in social affairs. “It’s an insult,” he said. “If and when Hillary is in the White House, she can hire somebody. ” Donald J. Trump’s campaign is likewise considering how it might put family members to best use if the Republican nominee is elected. The Trump team has made clear that Ivanka, his oldest daughter, would take a leading role in an administration, along with her husband, Jared Kushner. At a panel event on Tuesday, Ms. Clinton took aim at Ms. Trump, with whom she had become friends in recent years, in response to a question about Mr. Trump’s policies. Ms. Clinton reminded the crowd that some of Ms. Trump’s paeans to women’s economic issues in her convention speech last week bore little resemblance to anything Mr. Trump had said on the campaign trail. “There are no policies on any of those fronts that you just mentioned on his website,” she said, imagining a conversation with Ms. Trump. “Not last week, not this week. ” A few minutes later, the   gathering  —   hosted by Glamour and Facebook, with an open bar  —   neared its end with an appearance from a   dance group, performing to a Beyoncé song. Soon, the party was over. Ms. Clinton smiled politely and walked off the stage. She was expected a short while later in the convention hall, to cheer her parents on."
’These are not allies’: The most potent force fighting ISIS in Iraq has been accused of torturing and executing civilians,"’  ’ ’   The US has been leaning heavily on militias in its fight against   ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and while these forces have proved very   effective on the ground, some have been accused of committing   atrocities akin to their enemies. ’ ’   A  details allegations of torture   and abuse at the hands of Shia militias in Iraq, which have been   instrumental in aiding Iraqi Security Forces in seizing territory   back from ISIS (also known as the Islamic State, ISIL, or Daesh). ’ ’   The organization has ”received credible allegations of summary   executions, beatings of unarmed men, enforced disappearances, and   mutilation of corpses by government forces” that have been   fighting on the outskirts of Fallujah to retake the city from   ISIS, according to the report. ’ ’   Here are some of the allegations from the report: ’ ’   The abuse allegations, which have become widespread in Iraq, are   deepening the very sectarian tensions that facilitated the rise   of ISIS in the first place. ISIS is a Sunni terror group that   markets itself as a protector of Sunni civilians who have become   targets of Shia militias, which have the support of the     Iraqi government. ’ ’   Iran, a Shia theocracy and ally of Iraq, also backs these   militias as it attempts to extend its influence in the Middle   East. ’ ’   As the Human Rights Watch report makes clear, civilians often end   up caught in the middle of this sectarian power struggle. ’ ”   The Iraqi government, wanting to keep Iran happy, hasn’t done   much to rein in these militias. As a result, they often go   unchecked, using their power to suppress Sunnis. ” ’   ”It’’s a concerted effort [on behalf of the Shia militias] to   punish the Sunni population for, in their minds, accepting ISIS   or allowing ISIS,” Michael Pregent, an adjunct fellow at the   Hudson Institute and former US Army intelligence officer in Iraq,   told Business Insider. ’ ’   ”But in reality [Sunnis] had nowhere to go. They couldn’’t call   the police. They couldn’’t call the army.” ’ ’  ’ ”   And it doesn’t help that Fallujah has historically been a   stronghold for extremists in Iraq. ” ’   Phillip Smyth, a researcher at the University of Maryland who is   a leading expert on Shia militias, told Business Insider that   people in Fallujah ”gave Americans problems” during the Iraq War,   and ”gave the Iraqi government problems,” so the militias’’   solution to routing the extremists ”is to just smash” everything. ’ ’   The Human Rights Watch report notes a video posted online that   shows a Shia commander telling a room full of fighters that   ”Fallujah had been a bastion of terrorism since 2004 and that no   civilians or true Muslims were left inside the city.” ’ ”   Treating all civilians in Fallujah as ISIS sympathizers plays   right into ISIS’ hand. If civilians are targeted by the militias   that are supposedly liberating them from terrorist control, they   become even more likely to turn against the Iraqi government. ” ’   ”If the US continues to support Iraqi units that integrate Shia   militias into their operations, they’’re simply resetting the   conditions that led to ISIS to begin with,” Pregent said. ”You’’re   further entrenching Sunni distrust of their government   …     and the   United States.” ’ ’   These Shia militias are no friend to the US, either. ’ ’   ”These are not allies,” Pregent said. ”Everybody keeps thinking   that these militias are working on a friendly basis with the US.   They still hate us as much as they hate ISIS.” ’ ”   Still, there aren’t many good alternatives, and it might be too   late for the Iraqi government to rein in the militias without   facing blowback from Iran. ” ’   ”There’’s very, very little that can really be done in order to   turn this ship and make this all go away,” Smyth said. ”The genie   has now been let out of the bottle, so how do you react to that?” ’ ’  ’ ’   Militias are now deeply entrenched in Iraq. ’ ’   ”These groups are extremely powerful,” Smyth said. ”They have   sometimes tens of thousands of members, they’’re actively deployed   in multiple battlefronts. And beyond that they have very strong   backers, particularly Iran.” ’ ”   On top of that, the Iraqi Army  as a fighting force that they can’t   effectively take on ISIS without the help of these militias. ” ’   ”When you really look at it from a government point of view, they   are not on the strong end of this,” Smyth said. ”They also have   to deal with these forces because they’’re the ones taking the   battle to the Islamic State.” ’ ”   Despite the evidence of Shia militia abuses, they’re unlikely to   face much punishment. There’s too much support for the militias   in the   Iraqi government   these organizations have   fully integrated themselves not just on the battlefield, but in   Iraqi politics as well. ” ’   ”I don’’t think anything is going to come of it because if [Iraqi   Prime Minister Haider]   opposes the militias, he’’s likely   to be deposed.   …     He has to accept their role in these   operations,” Pregent said. ’ ’   ”He could come back and say ’’a couple of guys were punished,’’ but   we don’’t ever really see these groups punished.” ’ ”   And it’s not just the militias   Shiites from these organizations   have also permeated the Iraqi Security Forces and federal police,   Smyth said. ” ’   ”You’’re not going to get much done,” Smyth said. ”They are   integrated into the system.” ’ ’The US has been leaning heavily on militias in. ..’"
BOILING POINT: Reports of GOP turmoil swirl as Trump goes rogue,"’  ’ ”   Donald Trump’s refusal to endorse House Speaker Paul Ryan, his   unabashed criticism of a family whose son was killed fighting in   Iraq, and a series of other   missteps have infuriated   key members of the Republican Party and left his campaign staff   demoralized, according to multiple reports published Wednesday   morning. ” ’   One source close to the campaign  by characterizing the Trump staff as ”suicidal.” ’ ’   ”Manafort not challenging [Trump] anymore,” said the source,   described as an ally of campaign chairman Paul Manafort. ”Mailing   it in. Staff suicidal.” ’ ’  ’ ”   Officials within the GOP didn’t seem to have much more optimism. ” ’   ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl  that ”senior officials at the party   are actively exploring what would happen if Trump dropped out”   and are wondering about ”how to replace him on the ballot.” ’ ’   ”He is so unpredictable right now, they are so unable to control   his message that they just don’’t know and they clearly think it   is a possibility, which is why they’’re looking at these rules,”   Karl said on ”Good Morning America.” ’ ’   A top Republican  that Reince Priebus, the   Republican National Committee chairman, was ”apoplectic” over   Trump’’s refusal to endorse Ryan in his House reelection race.   Priebus was described as ”furious” by sources who spoke with   Karl. ’ ’   Even Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, Trump’’s running mate, distanced   himself from Trump by telling Fox News on Wednesday that he   ”strongly support[s]” Ryan and endorses his reelection. ’ ’   And former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, one of Trump’’s most   ardent supporters,  for what he called   ” ” behavior. ’ ’   ”Trump is still behaving like as though it was the primaries and   there were 17 candidates,” Gingrich told Fox Business Channel on   Wednesday. ”He has not made the transition to being the potential   president of the United States, which is a much tougher league.” ’ ”   Republicans close to Trump were plotting an intervention to   protect other Republican candidates who will also be up for   election this November, NBC News reported. Top Republicans were   said to be hoping that Trump’s children could help rein him in. ” ’   A CNN reporter cited a Trump adviser who said the media needed to   focus more on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and   less on Trump: ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’t. says a big part of the frustration inside the Trump campaign is that the media is focused too much on   HRC. ’t’t’ ’   Trump spokesman Jason Miller pushed back on the reports of   turmoil within the campaign,  out a statement. ’ ’   ”The idea that Paul Manafort is mailing it in is completely   erroneous,” the statement said. ”Our campaign just finished up   our strongest month of fundraising to date, we’’re adding talented   and experienced staffers on a daily basis, and Mr. Trump’’s   turning out bigger and more enthusiastic crowds than Hillary   Clinton ever could.” ’ ’   Manafort has also denied the reports: ’ ’ ’ ’  just told me  report wrong    that all is ok on the  Train. From outside of course it looks like no rails. ’t’t’ ’   And Trump stood firm, saying nothing was amiss. He tweeted   Wednesday morning: ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tThere is great unity in my campaign, perhaps greater than ever before. I want to thank everyone for your tremendous support. Beat Crooked H! ’t’t’"
Mark Cuban Would Rather ‘Lose Every Penny’ Than Have Trump as President - Breitbart,"In case you happened to wonder what billionaire businessman, investor, and NBA owner Mark Cuban thinks of a potential Donald Trump presidency, the Dallas Mavericks owner held court on NBC Sports Radio’s Newy Scruggs Show, and informed all that he would rather go flat broke, and experience all Mavericks fans turn on him and his team, than see Donald Trump in the White House. [Cuban told Scruggs, “When it’s all said and done, I’d rather lose every penny than have Trump as president, because I care more about the future of my family, my children than I do about my pocketbook. And if it means we have to play in empty arenas, I’m down with that.  “Maybe I pick up some fans. Maybe I lose some fans. I don’t know. I’ve heard it from both. I’ve had people say, ‘There’s no way I can support you. I won’t go to another Mavs game.’ And I’ve had people say, ‘You know what? We’re buying Mavs tickets. ’” This represents quite the shift from what Cuban said about Trump in May, when he told NBC he would consider running on Trump’s ticket if the Republican nominee asked him to. Of course, in the same interview, he also said he would consider running on Hillary’s ticket. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn"
Toni Anderson: Dashcam footage shows traffic stop before drowning ," (CNN) Just hours before Toni Anderson vanished, a police officer stopped her for driving the wrong way on a   street    then let her drive off, dashcam video just released by police in suburban Kansas City, Missouri, shows. The footage, from about 4:25 a. m. CT on January 15, is among the last known records of Anderson, 20, before her car, with her body in it, were pulled March 10 from the Missouri River. The tape has raised questions about the officer’s decision to let Anderson simply drive away in a case that set off a weekslong search for her across Missouri, her native Kansas and on social media. READ MORE: Medical Examiner’s report, Anderson died from accidental drowning, with ”ethanol, cocaine and amphetamine intoxication” described as contributing factors, the Jackson County, Missouri, Medical Examiner’s Office announced last week. ’I don’t feel good’ The dashcam video, released by police, includes an audio exchange in which Anderson tells the North Kansas City, Missouri, officer she doesn’t ”feel good.” Anderson giggles when the officer, a   veteran of the force whom the department declined to name, tells her she was on the wrong side of the road.  ”Have you been drinking,” he asks, according to the video. ”Are you taking any medications or anything?”  ”No, I am just really sick,” Anderson responds. ”I don’t feel good.” The officer asks for Anderson’s license and registration, which she appears to provide. He walks back to his squad car while she stays in her black 2014 Ford Focus. He quickly returns and tells Anderson to ”pull into that parking lot” across the street, pointing to a QuikTrip service station.  ”Sit there for a while and gather yourself,” he says.  After the   exchange, the dashcam video shows the officer follow Anderson in his squad car as she drives across the road and pulls up to a gas pump. The   camera stays trained on Anderson’s car for about seven more minutes until the officer drives off.   ’Officer’s actions were reasonable’ The video was just released by the North Kansas City Police Department because the Kansas City Police Department has closed its investigation. The Kansas City Police Department was investigating because a missing person report on Anderson was filed with the department. ”Based on this review, we believe that the officer’s actions were reasonable,” North Kansas City police said in a statement.  Anderson was headed home from her job at a local club when police stopped her, her boyfriend, Pete Sanchez, told CNN. She left work at 4:11 a. m. and was adamant about going to a gas station, he said. During the time the dashcam video shows Anderson’s car at the gas pump, she reportedly sent a text to her friend, Roxanne Townsend. ”It was exactly 4:42 when she texted me and said, ’I just got pulled over again.’ She said ’again’ because she gets pulled over all the time,” Townsend told CNN affiliate KDAF. Anderson’s parents think she got disoriented after the traffic stop and inadvertently drove onto an icy boat launch, they told CNN affiliate KCTV. When her car was pulled from the river, a window was down and her seat belt was off, the medical examiner’s report states. Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated the location of the officer’s traffic stop and also misidentified the police department that has since closed an investigation of the incident. The article has been updated to reflect that the officer was inside his own jurisdiction when he stopped Toni Anderson and that it was the Kansas City Police Department that closed its investigation.

George H.W. Bush still hates broccoli,"Washington (CNN) Not even a heartfelt letter from a      can produce a change in President George H. W. Bush’s hatred of broccoli. On Saturday, the 41st president tweeted a photo of a letter purportedly from a boy named Cooper who endorsed the vegetable and urged the    president to start embracing the green sprout. Cooper wrote, ”My grama told me that you do not like broccoli and never want it served . .. Mr. President, broccoli is really good for you. I wish you liked broccoli like I do.” In the tweet, Bush replied, ”Proud of young Cooper’s interest in healthy eating. His declared love of broccoli is genuine, if also unpersuasive.” Bush, who reportedly banned broccoli from Air Force One during his presidency, has long made his distaste for the vegetable known. ”I do not like broccoli. And I haven’t liked it since I was a little kid,” he memorably said in 1990. ”And my mother made me eat it. And I’m president of the United States, and I’m not going to eat anymore broccoli.”"
"After Backlash, DeVos Backpedals on Remarks on Historically Black Colleges - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Facing a fierce backlash after she called historically black colleges and universities “real pioneers” of school choice, Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, spent Tuesday afternoon backtracking on the controversial statement and highlighting the institutions’ roots in racism and segregation. Ms. DeVos, in a series of Twitter posts on Tuesday and in remarks at a luncheon with presidents from some of the schools, repeatedly acknowledged that the schools were not created simply to give   students more choices but because black students across the country were not allowed into segregated white schools. The controversy is the latest gaffe for Ms. DeVos, who has had a rough start. Since Vice President Mike Pence cast the tiebreaking vote to confirm her, Ms. DeVos has fled from a small group of protesters who temporarily blocked her from entering a school, been criticized by a middle school’s administrators for saying their teachers were in “receive mode,” and suffered through the embarrassment of the Education Department misspelling the name of the civil rights icon W. E. B. Du Bois in an official tweet. The latest controversy began on Monday evening when Ms. DeVos released a statement shortly after meeting with several presidents of historically black colleges and universities. In it, Ms. DeVos began by praising the schools for making “tangible, structural reforms” that allowed students, often underserved, to reach their full potential. “They started from the fact that there were too many students in America who did not have equal access to education,” she said in the statement. “They saw that the system wasn’t working, that there was an absence of opportunity, so they took it upon themselves to provide the solution. ” Historically black colleges and universities “are real pioneers when it comes to school choice,” the statement continued. “They are living proof that when more options are provided to students, they are afforded greater access and greater quality. Their success has shown that more options help students flourish. ” On Twitter, hundreds of angry users accused her of ignoring the fact that many of the schools were founded because black students were not allowed to attend segregated white schools, not because education pioneers wanted to give   more options in higher education. Many accused her of using the nation’s history of segregation to advance a contemporary political agenda. Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, said the comment was “tone deaf. ” Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, called the statement “totally nuts. ” Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, was biting. On Tuesday afternoon, Ms. DeVos seemed to backpedal on her statement at a luncheon for the school presidents at the Library of Congress. “Bucking that status quo, and providing an alternative option to students denied the right to attend a quality school is the legacy of HBCUs,” she said, according to prepared remarks released by her office. “But your history was born, not out of mere choice, but out of necessity, in the face of racism, and in the aftermath of the Civil War. ” She added that historically black colleges and universities “remain at the forefront of opening doors that had previously been closed to so many,” and that the schools “made higher education accessible to students who otherwise would have been denied the opportunity. ” Ms. DeVos later published several tweets repeating those sentiments in an effort to clear up her earlier comments. Still, Ms. DeVos in her speech referred to Mary McLeod Bethune, a famous civil rights activist and educator, as a leader who “is less well known than others in the HBCU legacy. ” Ms. DeVos said Ms. Bethune, who founded   University in Daytona, Fla. inspired her because she recognized that traditional school “systemically failed to provide   access to a quality education  —   or, sadly, more often to any education at all. ” Ms. DeVos, an aggressive backer of publicly funded vouchers that public school students could use for private school tuition, also used her speech before the presidents of several historically black colleges and universities to highlight school choice programs. She pointed out that her friend and a black woman attending the luncheon, Denisha Merriweather, had been raised by a single mother in poverty, failed the third grade twice, but is now scheduled to graduate in May with a master’s degree because a family member intervened in her life “with the assistance of a school choice program in Florida. ” Ms. DeVos also mentioned an executive order signed by President Trump on Tuesday afternoon dealing with historically black colleges and universities. A White House official said the order was designed to more closely coordinate the White House with efforts to increase funding to the schools and to encourage more private groups and organizations to work with the schools."
Iran Launches First Navy Drill Since Trump Took Office,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP)  —   Iran’s navy began an annual drill Sunday near the strategic Strait of Hormuz, its first major exercise since the inauguration of U. S. President Donald Trump, state television reported. [The TV report quoted navy chief Adm. Habibollah Sayyari as saying the   maneuver will cover an area of 2 million square kilometers (772, 000 square miles) in the Sea of Oman and the Indian Ocean near the strait. It showed Iranian warships and helicopters taking part in the exercise.  Nearly a third of all oil traded by sea passes through the strait and it has been the scene of previous confrontations between the U. S. and Iran. But the drill does not involve Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guard, a paramilitary force the U. S. Navy often criticizes for harassing its vessels. The U. S. Navy’s 5th Fleet, based in Bahrain, declined to comment on the exercise or discuss if it had any plans to monitor the drill. Iran’s navy routinely holds war games it says are aimed at improving its readiness against threats. It also sends its warships to international waters off the Gulf of Aden to fight piracy."
"DELINGPOLE: Breitbart Is ’Very Extreme Right,’ Berkeley Prof Tells BBC - Breitbart","Breitbart is a “very extreme right” organization that pumps out “fake news” but has no impact in the real world because it is ignored by the mainstream media. [I learned this from a Berkeley professor of linguistics called George Lakoff who was given space by the BBC to spout his views, virtually unchallenged, for half an hour this week on a Radio 4 programme called Word of Mouth.  Lakoff was introduced as an “eminent linguist” at the “forefront of the debate. ” But no indication was given by the presenter Michael Rosen that he is, in fact, a   professor from a   university best known for writing   books about how awful conservatives are and, most recently, for his vocal opposition to Donald Trump. Perhaps this is because Rosen is   himself. As I’ve argued over similar issues before, none of this would matter a damn if Radio 4 were a commercial channel paid for by advertising or a subscription channel for smug liberals who wanted none of their prejudices challenged. But Radio 4 is neither of those things. It’s a branch of Britain’s state broadcasting arm, the BBC  —   an organization funded by a compulsory subscription fee which all users are obliged to pay on pain of imprisonment. While it’s true that you don’t need a TV license to listen to the radio, it’s also true that Radio 4 is a   beneficiary of the BBC’s   domination of Britain’s airwaves. It has virtually no competition in the field of   features on the radio, firstly, because it has dominated the medium for so long and secondly because it is so massively subsidised (hence the lack of irritating adverts!) it would be virtually suicidal for any commercial venture to try to compete with it. In return for this extremely privileged position —  which ought, by rights, to have long since been withdrawn by   regulators  —   it is obliged under the terms of the BBC’s charter to produce output that is rigorously fair and balanced. This is why we should get cross: not because nasty, horrid, untrue things were said about Breitbart, but because nasty, horrid, untrue things were said about Breitbart by an organization wearing the mantle of authority and the mask of objectivity. Whether rightly or no, the BBC is a media outfit that commands considerable respect around the world. By allowing this professor to make his claims unchallenged on air, the BBC has legitimized the malign, dangerous, and defamatory notions that Breitbart is a) unprofessional, b) outside the realms of acceptable public discourse, and c) on par with the Nazis, the fascists, the Ku Klux Klan, and all the other groups routinely associated with the “extreme right. ” And, note, that “extreme right” was not the phrase Lakoff used. Nope, it was “very extreme right. ” Now, suppose for a moment the BBC had managed to find a conservative professor of linguistics  —   unlikely, I know, but just suppose  …      —   and he’d vented about some   media outfit he didn’t like, calling it “extreme  ” and accusing it of putting out “fake news. ” How do you think he would have been treated by the BBC? At the very least, I would suggest, the BBC would have invited him to justify his criticism. He certainly wouldn’t have been given the free pass that was afforded this Berkeley leftist. The other thing that would have been routinely expected of him is a degree of expertise. What, after all, is the point of inviting an “expert” on if he’s not going to display superior insights into the subject that is supposedly his field? But, shamingly, Lakoff failed almost completely on this score. He claimed that “snowflake” is used as a “slur against gays, who are seen as delicate and flakey. ” Really? I don’t think I’ve ever seen “snowflake” used in that context. It’s used as a term of mockery for hypersensitive millennials who prefer to be protected from ideas or language they don’t agree with, whether they happen to be gay or straight is neither here nor there. He claimed that the phrase “alt right plays on the word ‘alt,’ meaning old, calling up issues from Germany, which is interesting. ” Do you see what the professor did there? Yep. Shameless beyond belief, I know, but he really did just invent a spurious etymology for the “alt” in “alt right. ” (Of course, it stands for alternative and has nothing to do with the German word for “old. ”) He then used it as a way of hinting that the people involved in the “alt right” are sorta, kinda like Hitler. He claimed that the term “fascists” has been embraced by people on the right and that they are proud to define themselves in opposition to the “antifas. ” Nope. Again, he has got it completely wrong. It’s the left that uses “fascist” ad nauseam to describe anyone it disagrees with. “Antifa” is a term the left has chosen to point up this false distinction. He claimed that “ ” is a phrase proudly used by progressives to indicate “I know what’s right. These are our values. ” Again, 100 percent incorrect, professor. “ ” was a phrase coined by the classical   journalist James Bartholomew in the Spectatori to mock the left’s priggish  . This, remember, is a professor of linguistics speaking. Knowing this stuff is his   job. But though he doesn’t appear to have mastered even the basics, he is yet taken seriously enough by the BBC to spout his vile and ignorant prejudice for a full   on an afternoon radio show. Fake news indeed."
Hillary Clinton’s campaign is clobbering Bernie Sanders 2 days before the next big contest,"’’ ”Ahead of Saturday’s Democratic caucuses in Nevada, several   Latino surrogates for Hillary Clinton aren’t containing their discontent with Bernie Sanders’ voting record.” ’In a press call on Thursday, US Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, US Rep. Luis Gutiérrez ( ) and activist Dolores Huerta hammered Sanders repeatedly for his votes against a 2007   bill and his support for a 2006 bill allowing people who live in the US without permission to be detained indefinitely.’ ’Castro, widely rumored to be on the short list of Clinton’’s potential   picks, criticized Sanders for touting a   record that ”doesn’’t exist. ”’ ’”It’’s disappointing to see Sen. Sanders talk up a record that just doesn’’t exist,” Castro said. ”And that’’s really what I want to emphasize of what we said: Sen. Sanders consistently wasn’’t there when we needed him the most. ”’ ”Gutiérrez acknowledged Sanders’ support for the US Senate’s 2013   bill, one of the most highly contested congressional battles of the Obama administration. But Gutiérrez said that that wasn’t enough.” ’”I never remember Bernie saying, ’’By the way, can you use a helping hand if there’’s something we can do together. Is there something we can work on together on immigrant and Latino issues? ’’” Gutiérrez said. ”Never once. ”’ ’He added:’ ”Thursday’s press call came as Clinton and Sanders attempt to woo Latino voters before Saturday’s Nevada caucuses, where the voting bloc is expected to play a key role.” ”Clinton’s campaign has been on the ground for months attempting to shore up support and train local volunteers to canvas and conduct caucuses in English and Spanish.” ’’ ”But Sanders isn’t conceding Nevada or the immigration debate.” ’Over the past several weeks, the senator’’s campaign slammed Clinton for asserting in 2014 that the wave of immigrant children fleeing strife in Latin America should be sent back to ”send a message. ”’ ’”Secretary Clinton is wrong. We should never put children back into harm’’s way to ’’send a message’’ to anyone,” Sanders’’ Hispanic media director, Arturo Carmona, said in a statement. ”That’’s why Sen. Sanders has put forward a serious immigration plan that focuses on protecting kids and keeping families together. It is time for Secretary Clinton to do the same. ”’ ’Carmona, during a call with reporters in December, said that the campaign was already seeing a major uptick in interest from Hispanic volunteers.’ ’”Latinos are really gravitating towards our campaign, and the numbers are changing every day, especially in states like Nevada,” Carmona said.’ ’”We had thousands of Latino and   volunteers doing a call a couple weeks back with one of our celebrity endorsers, George Lopez,” he continued. ”We got nearly 1, 000 volunteers in one hour. ”’ ”Ahead of Saturday’s Democratic caucuses in. ..”"
The American suburbs as we know them are dying,"’  ’ ’     Look no further than the suburbs to see how American ideals     about success are transforming.   ’ ’     People in the US suburbs are changing the way they shop, where     they eat, and what they want in their homes.   ’ ’     Malls are shutting down as   continues to take over,     and the   chains that fed shoppers after a day of     hoofing it through the mall are struggling to cope.   ’ ’     Business Insider reporters from our consumer, transportation,     news, graphics, video, and innovation teams have explored this     idea in a series of stories.   ’ ”     We’re calling it the Death of Suburbia  —   because if the trends     that they identified continue, the many suburbs as we know them     will be forever changed.   ” ’     Urban and suburban areas are becoming less distinguishable as     modern populations value convenience and location over     size.    ’ ’     The line between city and suburb has already started to blur,     Fadi Masoud, an urban planning professor at the University     of Toronto who contributed to a forthcoming book called     ”Infinite Suburbia” told Business Insider’’s Leanna     Garfield.    ’ ’     ”Some people still attribute the oldest part of the city, which     is predominantly   and more dense as ‘urban,’     and then everything else that starts going out further in     distance from the core as ’’suburban. ’’ But that definition     doesn’t work as well now,” he tells Business Insider. ”What you     would usually define as urban and suburban is eroding.”   ’ ’     Urban planners across America are rethinking how suburbs are     designed. Towns like New Rochelle, a suburb of New York     City, are evolving to focus less on space and possession and     more on walkability and environmental impact.    ’ ’  ’ ’       The   mansions of old are plummeting in       value as homebuyers become more discerning.     ’ ”       In an article from August 2016,  from   site Trulia that       showed that the premiums paid for McMansions have declined       significantly in 85 of the country’s 100 biggest cities.     ” ’       For the purpose of the study, Trulia defined a McMansion as a       home that was built between 2001 and 2007 and that has       between 3, 000 and 5, 000 square feet of space.     ’ ”       To cite one example, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the extra       money that buyers were expected to be willing to pay to own a       McMansion fell by 84% from 2012 to 2016. In that same city in       2012, a typical McMansion would be valued at $477, 000, about       274% more than the area’s other homes. Today, a McMansion       would be valued at $611, 000, or 190% above the rest of the       market.     ” ”       Experts told Business Insider’s Madeline Stone that the       youngest generations of homebuyers tend to value efficiency       more than ever before, and feel McMansions are       impractical and wasteful.      ” ’  ’ ”       As anchor store behemoths like Macy’s, Sears, and JCPenney       close hundreds of locations, the future of malls is in       jeopardy.       ” ”       The commercial real estate firm CoStar estimates that nearly       a quarter of malls in the US, or roughly 310 of the nation’s       1, 300 shopping malls, are at high risk of losing an anchor       store.      ” ’       Once that happens, it spells trouble for communities  —         especially those in the suburbs where job opportunities are       more limited than in cities.      ’ ’       ”Malls are big, big contributors to city and state taxes,       jobs, and everything,” Howard Davidowitz, chairman of       research firm Davidowitz & Associates, told Business       Insider’’s Hayley Peterson. ”Once they close, they are a       blight on the community for a very long time.”     ’ ”       As a transformation in retail continues to shutter giants       Sears and Macy’s and threaten malls across the country, food       court mainstays like Sbarro, Cinnabon,  and Panda Express face an uncertain       future.      ” ’  ’ ’       ”In the past several years, a handful of America’’s largest       corporations have joined a mass exodus from their suburban       headquarters to new home bases in the city, and millennials       seem to be the driving force,” writes Business Insider’’s       Chris Weller.      ’ ’       Beginning in 2015,  and  have all left the leafy suburbs of Chicago       for office spaces downtown.  ’ ’ General Electric announced it was ditching       Fairfield, Connecticut, for Boston.

"Barack Obama Warns Black Lives Matter ’Rhetoric,’ Violence, May Stop His Takeover of State, Local Police - Breitbart","President Barack Obama is warning his angry supporters that more violence and “rhetoric” by the Black Lives Matter movement could derail his campaign to federalize state and local police forces. [“In a movement like Black Lives Matter, there’s always going to be some folks who say things that are stupid, or imprudent, or overgeneralized, or harsh,” Obama told reporters at a Sunday press conference, just three days after an     racist murdered five police officers who were guarding a Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas.   “Everybody involved in the Black Lives Matter movement   …     I want all of them to maintain a respectful, thoughtful tone  —   because, as a practical matter, that’s what’s going to get change done,” Obama said.  The shocking attack in Dallas has wrecked the political momentum gained by the   movement when stressed police killed two   suspects during that first week of July, in Minnesota and Louisiana. Immediately after those shootings, Obama had sought to use the two shootings to push his campaign to get more federal regulatory control over state and local police forces. But because his campaign has been accompanied by a growing number of riots and of attacks on police, including in Dallas, Obama is being forced to defend and calm his angry allies, amid growing criticism that his   rhetoric has ignored a nationwide,   “War on Cops. ” So far this year, 26 police have been killed in shootings, marking a 63 percent increase over 2015, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page. After the Dallas shooting, gunman shot at three more policemen in Tennessee, Missouri, and Georgia. On Sunday, in Missouri, an   man was shot and killed as he broke into a police officers’ home following an argument on Facebook. The anger among Obama’s allies was recorded July 9, when a BLM activist in St. Paul, Minn. frantically berated a TV reporter, while others shouted ‘Get Out of Here,’ and urged each other to attack him. “He is the face of white supremacy,” the activist shouted. FOX reporter asks the ”peaceful protesters” why they are blocking a roadway: https:  .   —   Alison Arkin (@Cronikeys) July 11, 2016,  The video can be viewed here. The     movement also put rioters on the streets of several cities over the weekend. In 2014 and 2015,   rioters wrecked the town of Ferguson, Mo. and damaged the center of Baltimore. For the moment, Obama and his deputies are simply pretending that the Dallas attack had nothing to do the Black Lives Matter movement, despite the killer’s decision to explain his     motives to Dallas police. “The shooter is not reflective of the large movement to bring about change that was out in Dallas to peacefully demonstrate,” Jeh Johnson, Obama’s loyal head of the the Department of Homeland Security, told a CBS interviewer on Sunday. But the growing wave of attacks on cops has put Obama on the political defense, and his supporters may spin further out of control to create more riots or attack that would delegitimize his campaign to federalize state and local police forces  —   and also damage Hillary Clinton’s election chances. “I would just say to everybody who’s concerned about the issue of police shootings or racial bias in the criminal justice system that maintaining a truthful and serious and respectful tone is going to help mobilize American society to bring about real change. And that is our ultimate objective,” he said at the Sunday press conference.  Obama did briefly condemn attacks on police, but spent much of the Sunday press conference repeatedly telling his   allies that angry rhetoric against police is counterproductive to his political goals.  Any violence directed at police officers is a reprehensible crime and needs to be prosecuted.  But even rhetorically, if we paint police in broad brush, without recognizing that the vast majority of police officers are doing a really good job and are trying to protect people and do so fairly and without racial bias, if our rhetoric does not recognize that, then we’re going to lose allies in the reform cause. Yet Obama simultaneously raised the political temperature by portraying the   movement as similar to the prior   political groups, some of which have include violent campaigns, such as the attacks launched by the terrorist groups, such as the Black Panthers, the Weathermen and violence by union members. Obama even cited the abolitionist movement, whose work was completed by the very bloody U. S. Civil War.  One of the great things about America is that individual citizens and groups of citizens can petition their government, can protest, can speak truth to power.  And that is sometimes messy and controversial.  But because of that ability to protest and engage in free speech, America, over time, has gotten better.  We’ve all benefited from that.  The abolition movement was contentious.  The effort for women to get the right to vote was contentious and messy.  There were times when activists might have engaged in rhetoric that was overheated and occasionally counterproductive.  But the point was to raise issues so that we, as a society, could grapple with it.  The same was true with the Civil Rights Movement, the union movement, the environmental movement, the   movement during Vietnam.  And I think what you’re seeing now is part of that longstanding tradition. Obama also said that the “flip side” of   by his allies is for the cops to admit they’re in the wrong.  The flip side of that   …      would hope that police organizations are also respectful of the frustration that people in these communities feel and not just dismiss these protests and these complaints as political correctness, or as politics or attacks on police.  There are legitimate issues that have been raised, and there’s data and evidence to back up the concerns that are being expressed by these protesters.  “If police organizations and departments acknowledge that there’s a problem and there’s an issue, then that, too, is going to contribute to real solutions,” he said, without describing what would happen if police organizations do not submit to his political demands.

What happened the night of the Secret Service crash?,"Washington (CNN) The circumstances surrounding the two Secret Service Agents under investigation for allegedly driving under the influence and reportedly interrupting an active bomb investigation remain murky, according to accounts from law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation. CNN interviews with multiple sources reveal that while the two agents were returning from a farewell party, it’s still unclear when, exactly, the agents were stopped, and what gave the impression that they weren’t entirely sober. RELATED: Top House Republican: Secret Service failings put Obamas in ’jeopardy’ According to one source, the agents implicated in the incident are George Ogilvie, a top supervisor in the Washington field office, and Mark Connolly, a   member of President Barack Obama’s personal security detail.  Ogilvie was driving Connolly back to his car, parked on West Executive drive, the source said, after a farewell party for retiring agency spokesman Edwin Donovan held at Clyde’s restaurant near downtown D. C.’s Verizon Center. The two agents drove through the area that was part of the suspicious package investigation, first apparently driving under the police tape.   Multiple sources emphasized that, at least in arriving at the initial security checkpoint, the agents did not appear to be behaving erratically. A law enforcement source familiar with the incident said ”the car was moving pretty slowly,” a speed another source described as ”literally one mile an hour.” The Washington Post reported that the agents under investigation disrupted an active bomb investigation and drove right past the package. The Post has also reported the agents appeared intoxicated. While approaching the first security checkpoint at the White House, the car nudged an orange barrel out of the way, moving it just a few feet, one source said. There was no collision, the source said, and no damage to the car. The source said the security checkpoints went smoothly  —   the car was stopped at the first for a few seconds while the agents’ IDs were checked, and again at the second, where officers checked the car for explosives using a dog and a detection device. This source could not explain when the conduct of the agents became an issue with the other officers, but indicated it didn’t happen during the initial security checkpoints  —   opening the possibility that the incident under investigation took place at a later point that night. A U. S. law enforcement official confirmed to CNN that the officers in question were allowed to go home that night after a supervisor on duty overruled   law enforcement who wanted to arrest the agents and conduct sobriety tests, a breach of protocol that’s sparked a Homeland Security Inspector General investigation. Secret Service Director Joe Clancy did not learn about the incident until five days after it occurred, according to a law enforcement source close to the investigation. Sources could not say whether that was before or after the White House was informed. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Thursday decried the latest misconduct from the agency, with House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz saying the situation ”begs a lot of questions” and warning the state of the Secret Service has put the first family at risk. ”The more I’ve learned about [the incident] the more concerned I’ve become,” he said on CNN. ”We’re very united, Republicans and Democrats, in saying that the safety of the president is paramount, and we’re putting this person in jeopardy, and his family in jeopardy.”"
Obama Considers ‘Proportional’ Response to Russian Hacking in U.S. Election - The New York Times,"GREENSBORO, N. C.  —   President Obama is weighing a “proportional” response to Russia’s efforts to interfere with this fall’s election campaign through hacking, the White House announced Tuesday. “The president has talked before about the significant capabilities that the U. S. government has to both defend our systems in the United States but also carry out offensive operations in other countries,” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters traveling with Mr. Obama on Air Force One to Greensboro, where he was holding a town   meeting with students and campaigning for Hillary Clinton. “There are a range of responses that are available to the president, and he will consider a response that is proportional,” Mr. Earnest said. Whatever the president opts to do would probably not be announced in advance and may never be acknowledged or disclosed if it is carried out, Mr. Earnest said. On Friday, the Obama administration publicly acknowledged for the first time that it believed that the Russian government was responsible for stealing and disclosing emails from the Democratic National Committee and a range of other institutions and prominent individuals, most recently Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta. The emails were posted on the   WikiLeaks site and two newer sites, DCLeaks. com and Guccifer 2. 0. “Only Russia’s   officials could have authorized these activities,” said a statement from the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr. and the Department of Homeland Security. The statement did not name President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, but that appeared to be the intention. Emails from the Democratic National Committee appeared to show party officials conspiring to sabotage the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, leading to the resignation of Debbie Wasserman Schultz as chairwoman and the departure of several staff members from the organization. Much of the Russian efforts in the election appear directed at undermining the campaigns of Mrs. Clinton and other Democrats. Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, has called Mr. Putin a better leader than Mr. Obama and suggested a more collaborative relationship between the United States and Russia. The Russian efforts have become a talking point in the campaign. In Sunday’s debate, Mrs. Clinton called Russia’s interference in the campaign unprecedented. “And believe me, they’re not doing it to get me elected,” she said. “They’re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump. ” In the debate on Sept. 26, Mr. Trump said the identity of the hackers was unknown and “could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, O. K. ” On Sunday night, he again suggested that Russia might not be to blame for the email releases and said that “they blame Russia because they think they’re trying to tarnish me with Russia. ” “I know nothing about Russia. I know  —   I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia,” Mr. Trump continued. “I don’t deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia. ”"
"Michael Ian Black, Simon &amp Schuster Prepare to Release ’A Child’s First Book of Trump’ Before GOP Convention - Breitbart","  Michael Ian Black has teamed up with the children’s division of publisher Simon  Schuster to release A Child’s First Book of Trump, a parody children’s picture book that will explore the “curious creature” that is the GOP presidential frontrunner.  According to its Amazon page, the   book  —   authored by Black and illustrated by Marc Rosenthal  —   is intended for adults, even though it will reportedly be published by Simon  Schuster’s Books for Young Readers imprint. “The Trump is a curious creature, very often spotted in the wild, but confounding to our youngest citizens. A business mogul, reality TV host, and now  …    political candidate?” the book’s synopsis reads. “Kids (and let’s be honest many adults) might have difficulty discerning just what this thing that’s been dominating news coverage this election cycle is. Could he actually be real? Are those  …    words coming out of his mouth? Why are his hands so tiny? And perhaps most importantly, what on earth do you do when you encounter an American Trump?” In a statement released through the book’s publisher, Black played up the children’  humor the book will likely draw on. “Yes, Trumps are wild and unpredictable creatures, but with a little knowledge, I hope everybody can learn to appreciate the Trump for the misunderstood, absurd creature it is,” Black said in a statement, according to the New York Post. The book’s Amazon page also includes a short excerpt of the kind of humor readers can expect: “The beasty is called an American Trump. Its skin is bright orange, its figure is plump. Its fur so complex you might get enveloped. Its hands though are, sadly, underdeveloped. ” The    Wet Hot American Summer star has used his trademark snark to skewer (mostly Republican) presidential candidates this election cycle. After Trump won the New Hampshire primary in February, Black took to Twitter to poll followers on whether they thought   Marco Rubio would perform a sex act on Trump to secure the vice presidential slot.  Black also came under fire on social media in November for politicizing the Paris terror attacks while the attacks were still underway. A Child’s First Book of Trump is due out July 12.   have begun on Amazon."

Alice Stewart Pitches Ted Cruz as Donald Trump’s Vice President,"Could the two most ferocious Republican presidential candidates in a generation put aside their very personal differences and unite for the good of the country? That’s what the communications director for the one who lost said in an Independence Day appearance on CNN. [“I think we’re looking at someone like Newt Gingrich or possibly Chris Christie,” Alice Stewart, Sen. Ted Cruz’s   director from his 2016 GOP presidential bid, said on CNN when asked whom she thinks presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump will pick as his vice president.  But as to  who would be best for Trump in a general election against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton, Stewart pushed her old boss Cruz for the job. “I think Ted Cruz has tremendous momentum,” Stewart said next. “Needless to say, I think there’s some water that needs to be mended in between the two candidates. But that would be my pick. ” That Stewart would pitch Cruz —  clearly another talented GOP candidate who if he joined forces with Trump would make them virtually unstoppable —  is yet another sign that Cruz’s camp has clearly come a long way since the divisive primary. Other signs of recent progress include that Jason Miller, a senior communications adviser to Cruz, has joined the Trump campaign as communications director and Cruz Super PAC adviser KellyAnne Conway has joined the Trump campaign in a senior capacity as well. “I’m saying who I think would be the best VP given [that Cruz was] number two coming out of the primary has tremendous support,” Stewart continued. “He is the leader of the conservative movement right now and I think he would be the best pick. ” That’s a long way from where Cruz and his allies were even a week ago, when Sen. Mike Lee ( ) appeared on the Steve Malzberg show on NewsMax TV to rip into Trump. Lee said: We can get into the fact that he accused my best friend’s father of conspiring to kill JFK. We can go through the fact that he has made some statements that some have identified, correctly, as religiously intolerant. We can into the fact that he is wildly unpopular in my state in part because my state consists of members who are a religious minority church, a people who were ordered exterminated by the governor of Missouri in 1838, and statements like that make them nervous. Now look, these things are not some things that I couldn’t get over if I heard the right things out of him. But if you want to go to why it is I have concerns, I can go on if you like. I hope I can get over these concerns. I hope Mr. Trump can help me identify them, but don’t sit here and tell me, Steve, that I have no reason to be concerned about Donald Trump. Cruz has been particularly quiet in recent weeks since dropping out of the race on May 3 after losing Indiana to Trump in the finale of a brutal, tumultuous,   ride of a race. Despite appearing in support of some Senate candidates like Darryl Glenn in Colorado —  Glenn has come out in full support of Trump for president —  Cruz has not said much about the presidential race since dropping out. If somehow Cruz were able to put aside personal grievances he has with Trump —  and Trump were willing to mend fences to pick Cruz as his vice president —  the two would be an essentially unstoppable force. Trump has received more votes in the GOP primaries than any other nominee in the GOP’s history, while Cruz received about as many votes as average GOP nominees. Both men would be ready for the presidency, and are in their own right individually viewed as formidable political forces. Together, these forces could be insurmountable. Ultimately, the two would have to come to an agreement that they would fully put everything that happened to them in the primaries aside, and agree to work together to win in November —  and to govern together after that. It remains to be seen if this will be the pick in the end, but right now Trump and his team are hyping other possibilities like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Sen. Jeff Sessions ( ) Sen. Joni Ernst ( ) Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, and Sen. Tom Cotton ( ). But if Cruz were willing to put aside his differences —  basically all personal, not   —  with Trump and come to the table, he just might skyrocket to the top of the list. If it all works out, too, they may just be unstoppable."
John Sununu: Republicans May ’Look at Alternatives’ if a ‘Disaster’ Candidate Like Trump Becomes Nominee,"John Sununu, the former New Hampshire senator and John Kasich supporter, urged Republican voters to “choose the strongest nominee they can  —   someone who will win. ” But he thinks Republicans may “look at alternatives” if “we have a nominee who is a disaster for the party. ”[On Breitbart News Daily, Stephen K. Bannon asked Sununu what he thought about the potential for a third party candidate should Trump become the nominee. Sununu cautioned that if Hillary Clinton is not defeated, she would continue Obama’s agenda, and would be able to appoint a Supreme Court nominee.  “That is one of the reasons why people need to look at John Kasich because he will win. He’ll win Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire,” Sununu added, claiming that top contenders Sen Ted Cruz ( ) and real estate developer Donald Trump have “no chance” to win those states against Hillary Clinton. “Whoever the nominee is, I think and I hope that Republicans support them, but what you’re talking about is a hypothetical where what happens if we have a Donald Trump who is running 10, 15 points behind HIllary Clinton,” Sununu said. “There’s been a lot of polling showing Trump is the weakest Republican we could put up. “What Republicans will do, if we have a nominee who is a disaster for the party, a nominee who is trailing badly, are they going to look at alternatives? I can’t tell you,” he added. “I want a Republican who is strong, who will generate broad support across the spectrum,” Sununu said of Ohio Governor John Kasich, who he is supporting.

Oklahoma Passes Bill That Would Subject Abortion Doctors to Felony Charges - The New York Times,"The Oklahoma Legislature on Thursday passed a bill that would effectively ban abortions by subjecting doctors who perform them to felony charges and revoking their medical licenses  —   the first legislation of its kind. In a year in which states have tried to outlaw abortions at 20 weeks of pregnancy, to ban the main surgical method used in the second trimester and to shut down abortion clinics with onerous regulations, Oklahoma’s bill is the most  . The measure, which passed the   Senate by a vote of 33 to 12, will be presented to Gov. Mary Fallin, a Republican, who will have five days to sign it, veto it or allow it to take effect without her signature. If it becomes law, it is certain to face a quick challenge in state or federal court. And because the Supreme Court has consistently ruled that women have a right to obtain abortions until the fetus is viable outside the womb, legal experts say, it will soon be declared unconstitutional. That has not deterred   politicians in a state dominated by conservative Republicans. Some say they welcome the chance to make a strong statement and to engage the issues in court. “Most people know I am for defending rights,” Senator Nathan Dahm, the author of the bill and a software developer from Broken Arrow, Okla. told The Oklahoman. “Those rights begin at conception. ” Mr. Dahm told reporters that he knew the measure would be challenged but expressed hope that the case would lead the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. Ms. Fallin, who has signed several   bills that were later blocked by the courts, will not comment on the new bill “until she and her staff have had a chance to review it,” Michael McNutt, her communications director, said in an email. But some legislators called the measure an   diversion. “I’m   and a Roman Catholic, but I don’t think we should waste our time on legislation that someone will declare unconstitutional,” Senator Ervin Yen, an anesthesiologist from Oklahoma City, and one of a small number of Republicans to oppose the bill, said in an interview. In an open letter on Thursday, the Center for Reproductive Rights, a legal group based in New York, urged Ms. Fallin to veto what it said was a “blatantly unconstitutional measure. ” Noting that it has sued Oklahoma eight times in the last six years, blocking lesser restrictions like the state’s effort to ban the   surgical method, the center said that “this bill will almost certainly lead to expensive court challenges that the State of Oklahoma simply cannot defend in light of longstanding Supreme Court precedent. ” The bill would strip doctors who perform abortions of their medical licenses unless the procedure was necessary to save a woman’s life. The felony provision does not include that exception. Currently, only two clinics in Oklahoma, one in Norman and one in Tulsa, provide abortions. A third, owned by Trust Women, a foundation based in Wichita, Kan. is under construction and is to open next month. Julie Burkhart, Trust Women’s chief executive, expressed dismay at the bill and urged Ms. Fallin to veto it. Oklahoma’s proposal to criminalize abortion may be the most stringent, but it is one of many new measures that continue in conservative states. This year, South Dakota joined 12 other states in banning abortions at 20 weeks of pregnancy, with a similar bill in South Carolina awaiting the signature of Gov. Nikki R. Haley. Alabama, Mississippi and West Virginia have passed laws to ban the use of the   surgical technique even though courts in Oklahoma and elsewhere have previously overturned such laws. Texas regulations that could force a majority of the state’s abortion clinics to close are the subject of a major Supreme Court case. The rules require that doctors have admitting privileges at local hospitals and that abortion clinics meet the stringent building and staffing standards of ambulatory surgery centers. The decision, expected in June, could have major effects on access to abortion in several other states. But the Supreme Court, while it is debating how far states may go in regulating abortion, has given no sign that it will overturn the basic right of women to obtain the procedure, which is at stake in the new Oklahoma bill."
Saudi beheadings:," (CNN)”I did not kill! I did not kill!” a woman shrieks as Saudi police wrap her head with a black scarf. ”Praise God,” a Saudi executioner dressed in white tells her. He lifts his long silver sword and strikes her neck    a gasp, then she falls silent. Twice more the hangman hacks at her neck, before stepping away to carefully wipe the blade.  Ambulance workers immediately start placing the woman’s remains on a stretcher as charges against her are hurriedly read out over a loud speaker in the Muslim holy city of Mecca.   She was accused of raping her    stepdaughter with a broomstick and beating her to death. ”A royal decree was issued to carry out the sharia law, in accordance with what is right,” the statement says. Cell phone footage of the execution, leaked last week by activists, gives a rare glimpse into what human rights groups call a barbaric practice of public decapitation as a punitive measure handed down by Saudi Arabia’s judicial system. The country executed 87 people in 2014, most by beheading, Human Rights Watch told CNN. Saudi officials told CNN the punishment is an integral part of their system of Islamic law, and the only violation that took place at the macabre scene was the illegal filming of the act.  The man responsible for the recording now faces charges of violating the country’s cyber laws and will be tried, a Saudi official not authorized to speak on the case said. ”We emphasize respect for the right to life as one of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the law. It should not make us forget the rights of other parties violated by the perpetrators, which has to be seen with the same degree of respect, Mohammed   of the government backed Saudi Human Rights Commission told CNN when asked specifically about the practice of beheading. The   kingdom appears unyielding to international pressure, but domestically, a quiet debate is ongoing between hardline conservatives and more moderate members of the legal community, experts tell CNN.  Abdulaziz Algasim, a former sharia law judge, said: ”From a pure Islamic law point of view there is no limitation for developing capital punishment.” But he said that methods such as lethal injection may be considered in coming years. ”There is dialogue in the jurisprudence society that another alternative action can achieve the goal with more mercy, and fit better with human rights.” A project inaugurated by the ruling King Abdullah to put laws into writing has ushered in a shift from the current uncodified system, which provides judges with little guideline or precedence.  ”This is all part of big issue of division. The sharia court led by conservatives wants to keep the regulation away from the influence of the political regime, so they are very sensitive,” Algasim says,  ”On the other side, the modernization has to be achieved and it needs a lot of development in the public policy if you want to develop a way to measure punishment and establish a more humanized alternative.” READ: Has Saudi Arabia bought world’s silence on human rights abuses?

LGBT Protests of Chick-Fil-A at Duquesne University Garner National Attention,"The ongoing saga of LGBT protests of an upcoming    restaurant on campus at Duquesne University, a Catholic college in Pittsburgh, has taken on biblical dimensions as a   of safe spaces and microaggressions in American higher education. [According to its mission statement, Duquesne University is “a Catholic university founded by members of the Congregation of the Holy Spirit,” dedicated to serving God while espousing a “profound concern for moral and spiritual values. ” It also professes a commitment to “an ecumenical atmosphere open to diversity. ”  For its part,    CEO management has articulated a biblical understanding of marriage that exactly mirrors Catholic teaching, while also emphasizing that they do not discriminate in any way, and are more than happy to serve anyone who wishes to eat at their establishment. In 2012, Dan Cathy, CEO of    stated: “We are very much supportive of the family  —   the biblical definition of the family unit. We are a   business, a   business, and we are married to our first wives. We give God thanks for that. ” “We know that it might not be popular with everyone, but thank the Lord, we live in a country where we can share our values and operate on biblical principles,” he said. Lambda   Alliance, the LGBT student organization on campus, considers   ’s commitment to traditional marriage potentially offensive to gay students, despite the obvious fact that no one is required to patronize the restaurant who doesn’t want to. At the March 26 meeting, Lambda executive board member Niko Martini proposed that the Student Government Association (SGA) pass a resolution asking the university to reconsider the inclusion of    as a dining option for students. Martini said he made the proposal on his own behalf and not Lambda’s. “   has a questionable history on civil rights and human rights,” Martini said. “I think it’s imperative the university chooses to do business with organizations that coincide with the [university’s] mission and expectations they give students regarding diversity and inclusion. ” Martini did not explain how eliminating a food establishment committed to a biblical understanding of marriage would increase diversity on campus. Meanwhile Lambda President Rachel Coury expressed worries that the safety of LGBT students might be at risk. “I’ve tried very hard within the last semester and a half to promote this safe environment for the LGBTQ+ community,” Coury said. “So I fear that with the    being in Options that maybe people will feel that safe place is at risk. ” Debate sparked by the confrontation, swirling around a series of issues from religious liberty to gay rights to a proper academic environment, have now reached a national level, according to the Duquesne Duke, the university’s campus newspaper. In an interview on Fox and Friends, retired U. S. Army Ranger Sean Parnell, an alumnus of Duquesne University, minced no words in expressing his dissent from the contemporary environment on the campus of his alma mater. “They’re a bunch of babies. College is supposed to prepare you for the real world, not shield you from opposing opinions, and safe spaces do exactly that. Who doesn’t want as an undergrad    on their campus? I would have killed for a c on my campus when I was at Duquesne,” he said. “My message is: toughen up. there are no safe spaces in the real world,” he said. “If you’re going to be successful in this life after you leave college you’ve got to learn to embrace adversity and open yourself up to a litany of different opinions. You will never be a CEO of a major company or an entrepreneur or a manager if you are not willing to work with people different than you. ” Hostility toward proponents of traditional marriage was foreseen by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito in his potent dissent of the landmark 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges case that made gay marriage the law of the land. Alito prophesied that the misguided decision would be used to damage citizens who do not share a contemporary view of marriage as an elastic arrangement between an unspecified number of unspecified persons. “It will be used,” he wrote presciently, “to vilify Americans who are unwilling to assent to the new orthodoxy. ” Follow Thomas D.

Democratic campaign erupts into firefight after Bernie Sanders ad criticizes Hillary Clinton on Wall Street,"’’ ”Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign pounced on Thursday after her chief primary rival, US Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) swiped at her in a television ad.” ’The Sanders ad never mentioned Clinton by name, but it did take an implicit shot at the Democratic   for her support on Wall Street.’ ’”There are two Democratic visions for regulating Wall Street. One says it’’s OK to take millions [in campaign contributions] from big banks, and then tell them what to do,” Sanders narrated in his spot.’ ’He added: ”My plan: Break up the big banks, close the tax loopholes, and make them pay their fair share. ”’ ”Although Sanders’ commercial is tame compared to the brutal attack ads seen elsewhere in politics, the Clinton campaign organized a phone call with reporters on Thursday to accuse Sanders of breaking his pledge to not run negative ads.” ’”We were very surprised today to see that Bernie Sanders had launched a negative television advertisement against Hillary,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said on the call.’ ’”We were particularly surprised because he had personally pledged  —   and his campaign had pledged  —   never to run a negative advertisement,” he added.’ ’Mook suggested that the ad was a sign that Sanders isn’’t the ”different kind of politician” his campaign had promised Democrats. The Clinton camp also said that it was very clear to both reporters and voters that the Sanders ad was attacking the former secretary of state  —   even if it didn’’t mention her by name.’ ’In a statement to Business Insider responding to the Clinton call, Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs suggested that his team rejected the idea that Sanders was now slinging mud on the airwaves.’ ’”This is not an ad directed at Secretary Clinton exclusively. It’’s about people in the Democratic establishment who believe you can take Wall Street’’s money and then somehow turn around and rein in the greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior,” Briggs said.’ ”Briggs went on to sharply contrast Clinton’s and Sanders’ approaches to regulating Wall Street.” ’”Obviously she is part of the establishment that Wall Street has showered with financial support. Bernie is not,” he continued. ”She wants Wall Street and corporate special interests to like her. Bernie does not. Bernie is showing that you can take on the corrupt   system. ”’ ”Thursday’s dispute represented only the latest firefight between the Clinton and Sanders campaigns, which comes as Sanders has  the first two states to weigh in on the Democratic primary. Clinton previously tended to ignore Sanders on the campaign trail, but she has shifted tactics to confronting him as the race careens toward February 1, the day of the Iowa caucus.” ”Earlier this week, Clinton’s campaign  that implicitly went after Sanders. That ad similarly featured the candidate narrating the spot, in which Clinton said she stood with US President Barack Obama on holding firearms manufacturers accountable for gun violence.” ’View the Sanders ad to which the Clinton camp objected below:’ ’’"
"Investigating Donald Trump, F.B.I. Sees No Clear Link to Russia - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   For much of the summer, the F. B. I. pursued a widening investigation into a Russian role in the American presidential campaign. Agents scrutinized advisers close to Donald J. Trump, looked for financial connections with Russian financial figures, searched for those involved in hacking the computers of Democrats, and even chased a lead  —   which they ultimately came to doubt  —   about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank. Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, F. B. I. and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump. Hillary Clinton’s supporters, angry over what they regard as a lack of scrutiny of Mr. Trump by law enforcement officials, pushed for these investigations. In recent days they have also demanded that James B. Comey, the director of the F. B. I. discuss them publicly, as he did last week when he announced that a new batch of emails possibly connected to Mrs. Clinton had been discovered. Supporters of Mrs. Clinton have argued that Mr. Trump’s evident affinity for Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin  —   Mr. Trump has called him a great leader and echoed his policies toward NATO, Ukraine and the war in Syria  —   and the hacks of leading Democrats like John D. Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign, are clear indications that Russia has taken sides in the presidential race and that voters should know what the F. B. I. has found. The F. B. I. ’s inquiries into Russia’s possible role continue, as does the investigation into the emails involving Mrs. Clinton’s top aide, Huma Abedin, on a computer she shared with her estranged husband, Anthony D. Weiner. Mrs. Clinton’s supporters argue that voters have as much right to know what the F. B. I. has found in Mr. Trump’s case, even if the findings are not yet conclusive. “You do not hear the director talking about any other investigation he is involved in,” Representative Gregory W. Meeks, Democrat of New York, said after Mr. Comey’s letter to Congress was made public. “Is he investigating the Trump Foundation? Is he looking into the Russians hacking into all of our emails? Is he looking into and deciding what is going on with regards to other allegations of the Trump Organization?” Mr. Comey would not even confirm the existence of any investigation of Mr. Trump’s aides when asked during an appearance in September before Congress. In the Obama administration’s internal deliberations over identifying the Russians as the source of the hacks, Mr. Comey also argued against doing so and succeeded in keeping the F. B. I. ’s imprimatur off the formal findings, a law enforcement official said. His stance was first reported by CNBC. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader, responded angrily on Sunday with a letter accusing the F. B. I. of not being forthcoming about Mr. Trump’s alleged ties with Moscow. “It has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisers, and the Russian government  —   a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity,” Mr. Reid wrote. “The public has a right to know this information. ” F. B. I. officials declined to comment on Monday. Intelligence officials have said in interviews over the last six weeks that apparent connections between some of Mr. Trump’s aides and Moscow originally compelled them to open a broad investigation into possible links between the Russian government and the Republican presidential candidate. Still, they have said that Mr. Trump himself has not become a target. And no evidence has emerged that would link him or anyone else in his business or political circle directly to Russia’s election operations. At least one part of the investigation has involved Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman for much of the year. Mr. Manafort, a veteran Republican political strategist, has had extensive business ties in Russia and other former Soviet states, especially Ukraine, where he served as an adviser to that country’s ousted president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. But the focus in that case was on Mr. Manafort’s ties with a kleptocratic government in Ukraine  —   and whether he had declared the income in the United States  —   and not necessarily on any Russian influence over Mr. Trump’s campaign, one official said. In classified sessions in August and September, intelligence officials also briefed congressional leaders on the possibility of financial ties between Russians and people connected to Mr. Trump. They focused particular attention on what cyberexperts said appeared to be a mysterious computer back channel between the Trump Organization and the Alfa Bank, which is one of Russia’s biggest banks and whose owners have longstanding ties to Mr. Putin. F. B. I. officials spent weeks examining computer data showing an odd stream of activity to a Trump Organization server and Alfa Bank. Computer logs obtained by The New York Times show that two servers at Alfa Bank sent more than 2, 700 “ ” messages  —   a first step for one system’s computers to talk to another  —   to a   server beginning in the spring. But the F. B. I. ultimately concluded that there could be an innocuous explanation, like a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts. The most serious part of the F. B. I. ’s investigation has focused on the computer hacks that the Obama administration now formally blames on Russia. That investigation also involves numerous officials from the intelligence agencies. Investigators, the officials said, have become increasingly confident, based on the evidence they have uncovered, that Russia’s direct goal is not to support the election of Mr. Trump, as many Democrats have asserted, but rather to disrupt the integrity of the political system and undermine America’s standing in the world more broadly. The hacking, they said, reflected an intensification of    operations that never entirely abated after the Cold War but that have become more aggressive in recent years as relations with Mr. Putin’s Russia have soured. A senior intelligence official, who like the others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a continuing national security investigation, said the Russians had become adept at exploiting computer vulnerabilities created by the relative openness of and reliance on the internet. Election officials in several states have reported what appeared to be cyberintrusions from Russia, and while many doubt that an Election Day hack could alter the outcome of the election, the F. B. I. agencies across the government are on alert for potential disruptions that could wreak havoc with the voting process itself. “It isn’t about the election,” a second senior official said, referring to the aims of Russia’s interference. “It’s about a threat to democracy. ” The investigation has treated it as a counterintelligence operation as much as a criminal one, though agents are also focusing on whether anyone in the United States was involved. The officials declined to discuss any individual targets of the investigation, even when assured of anonymity. As has been the case with the investigation into Mrs. Clinton, the F. B. I. has come under intense partisan political pressure  —   something the bureau’s leaders have long sought to avoid. Supporters of both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump have been equally impassioned in calling for investigations  —   and even in providing leads for investigators to follow. Mr. Reid, in a letter to Mr. Comey in August, asserted that Mr. Trump’s campaign “has employed a number of individuals with significant and disturbing ties to the Russia and the Kremlin. ” Although Mr. Reid cited no evidence and offered no names explicitly, he clearly referred to one of Mr. Trump’s earlier campaign advisers, Carter Page. Mr. Page, a former Merrill Lynch banker who founded an investment company in New York, Global Energy Capital, drew attention during the summer for a speech in which he criticized the United States and other Western nations for a “hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change” in Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union. Mr. Page responded with his own letter to Mr. Comey, denying wrongdoing and calling Mr. Reid’s accusations “a witch hunt. ” In an interview, he said that he had never been contacted by the F. B. I. and that the accusations were baseless and purely partisan because of his policy views on Russia. “These people really seem to be grasping at straws,” he said. Democrats have also accused another Republican strategist and Trump confidant, Roger Stone, of being a conduit between the Russian hackers and WikiLeaks, which has published the emails of the Democratic National Committee and Mr. Podesta, the Clinton campaign manager. Mr. Stone boasted of having contacts with the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, and appeared to predict the hacking of Mr. Podesta’s account, though he later denied having any prior knowledge. Mr. Stone derided the accusations and those raised by Michael J. Morell, a former C. I. A. director and a Clinton supporter, who has called Mr. Trump “an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation. ” In an article on the conservative news site Breitbart, Mr. Stone denied having links to Russians and called the accusations “the new McCarthyism. ”"
Spanish bullfighter gored to death ," (CNN) A professional bullfighter was gored to death by a bull during a competition on live television in Spain over the weekend.  Victor Barrio, 29,  was killed in Teruel, in the eastern Aragon region.  Plaza de Las Ventas bullring, where he’s worked as a bullfighter fox six years, announced his death in a statement Saturday. It said a moment of silence will be held in his honor. Spanish towns hold annual summer festivals in which bulls dash after humans in a short run that seems like an eternity. Spanish matador takes baby to work, sparks outrage, In Pamplona, where Spain’s famous bull run is held, the event dates to 400 years. It gained fame worldwide after author Ernest Hemingway wrote about it in his 1920s novel, ”The Sun Also Rises.”  The annual festival is so popular that Pamplona’s population of 200, 000 can triple during the eight consecutive days of running in July. Throngs of revelers travel to Spain every year for a chance to watch from the barricades and balconies.

A Reporter Recalls One of the Many Victims of Colombia’s War: Her Father - The New York Times,"The first person I wanted to call when I heard that Colombia’s government and the country’s largest leftist rebel group had reached a peace deal last week was my father. In 1999, my father, Jaime Correal Martinz, was kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. He was captured by a gang on his way home from work driven high into the mountains outside Bogotá, the capital and turned over to the rebel group, which held him for ransom for more than eight months. While my stepmother, Samantha, negotiated with the rebels and took care of my younger siblings Nicolas and Lorena in Bogotá, and I finished my sophomore year of college in the United States, my father was moved from camp to camp, hidden under the jungle canopy as military planes swarmed above. He slept in 38 different places. He wasn’t targeted for any particular reason. At the time, kidnapping for ransom was rampant in Colombia, one of the ways the rebels financed the insurgency, along with trafficking cocaine, and he was presumed to be wealthy. What would my father think of the peace deal with his kidnappers? While my father was being held, his travel company went out of business. We lost everything. And we were among the lucky ones. The   conflict, involving the FARC, the military and brutal   paramilitaries, is believed to have claimed more than 220, 000 lives, left 40, 000 people missing and displaced more than five million. The news that the FARC rebels have agreed, after four years of negotiations, to permanently lay down their arms, disband and join the political system is a cause for celebration for some in Colombia. It is the closest the country has ever come to ending its conflict, the longest war in the Americas. Peace in Colombia, the elusive dream of millions who have marched in the streets, seems finally within reach. President Juan Manuel Santos called the accord the door to “a new stage in our history. ” Yet on Oct. 2, when Colombians will have the final say on the peace deal by voting in a referendum, the decision will not be simple. Under the agreement, FARC fighters will receive amnesty for crimes such as drug trafficking. Those who confess to crimes like kidnapping and executions will be subject to five to eight years of restricted mobility, but no prison time. During that time, they are expected to perform social work in communities affected by the conflict. The deal faces significant political opposition, and many Colombians are furious. My father seldom mentioned his time with the FARC after he came home. Once, at the grocery store, he pointed to a package of crackers. “That’s what they gave us to eat during marches,” he said. Another time, he told me that rubber boots made a good pillow if you slipped one inside the other. Those moments offered glimpses of the distant world he had been pulled into, and how it lingered. Generally, and surely for our benefit, he made light of the kidnapping, calling it “my  ” and a   vacation. A decade after the fact, he told me more. I had gotten a grant from Transom. org to make a radio documentary, and we met in Bogotá. (A version of the documentary later aired on “This American Life. ”) Sitting at a friend’s kitchen table, he doodled on a notepad, smoked and talked. Yes, he was fed, even given cigarettes. No, he wasn’t kept in chains. But he was held alone for six months, confined to his   or caleta, where at night he lay awake thinking, or listening in secret to a radio program that aired messages for hostages. He was also forced to trek for days over punishing terrain. Once, when the military moved into a   area, he walked for 11 days straight, climbing a mountain pass in driving rain. Among the hostages on that march were the Ángulos, a   couple in their late 60s who had been kidnapped outside Bogotá. At some point, he told me, Carmenza Ángulo fell behind  —   her feet had swelled and wouldn’t fit into her boots. As she limped along in bare feet, her husband, Gerardo, stayed by her side. A FARC fighter circled back with them. When my father’s group stopped to rest for the night, the fighter reappeared the Ángulos did not. The guerrilla had led them into the trees and, acting on orders, killed them. They were too slow. Their children paid a ransom and searched for them for years in vain, their son Héctor Ángulo told me. Eventually, Héctor returned with a team of investigators and captured guerrillas to look for their bones. My father saw the complexity of the conflict from up close: the FARC’s capacity for cruelty, but also the helplessness, if not innocence, of some young fighters. A few of his armed guards were just 13. Many fighters had been taken from their homes and forced to join as children. One of these fighters played a role in his release. On my father’s 265th day in captivity, as he languished in a camp with several hostages, gunfire erupted outside their caletas. It was the Colombian military, with around 60 soldiers. They fired machine guns, threw grenades. When the noise stopped, a soldier wearing a bandanna approached. “Guys,” my father remembered him saying, “you’re free men. ” The rebels had fled. Among the soldiers was a figure smaller than the others, in a balaclava. After the ambush, she took off her mask, and my father recognized her. She was about 17, and a FARC fighter. He had seen her washing dishes in a camp mess hall. She had escaped, risking execution by the FARC, and turned herself over to the military. If it would free her    brother, who had been forced into the FARC, she would lead it to the captives, including a   hostage, the journalist Guillermo Cortés. She helped free five hostages. At the time, it was one of the largest rescues in Colombia’s history. (It is not clear what happened to her, or to her brother.) After the rescue, my family immediately moved to Panama, where we had family roots. We rarely returned to Colombia, but my father kept track of the news. In the years that followed, the FARC suffered a long string of battlefield setbacks, which ultimately led it to peace talks in Oslo and Havana. Through the peace process, my father remained deeply skeptical of the guerrillas, but hopeful. Was the deal finally reached last week something that he, a victim of the FARC, could endorse? Sadly, I couldn’t call and ask. My father died in June, after a series of strokes, at 63. In the end, the conflict outlived him, if only by a couple of months. After he died, as I prepared to fly back home to New York from Panama, I opened his closet and stood amid his shirts and suits. Seventeen years before, when he was taken from us the first time, I had done the same thing. Then, somewhat miraculously, he had returned. He was reunited with his wife, Samantha, and together they washed away the dank stench of the jungle before he slipped back into his clean, old clothes. With somewhat more effort, he let go of the rancor, the outrage at what had happened, quite senselessly, to him and to our family. Like so many victims of Colombia’s conflict now, in his time, he chose peace. “Did you know Jaime wanted peace with the FARC?” Samantha texted me over the weekend, adding a little heart. That did not mean that he had forgotten. He carried what he saw in that jungle within him forever."

It sounds like ISIS is in dire financial straits,"’  ’ ’   The terrorist group ISIS, while dealing with a consistent    in Iraq and Syria and unfulfilled  has shed benefits and raised taxes as it   starts . ’ ”   An ISIS memo found earlier this year saying the group had    for fighters by 50% was widely circulated as   evidence of the group’s financial problems. ” ”   But Adam J. Szubin, the acting under secretary for terrorism and   financial intelligence at the US Treasury Department, explained   that’s not the extent of the measures ISIS has taken to rein in   its spending. ” ’   ”Overall, ISIL is significantly constrained in terms of its   funding,” he  a publication of the Combatting   Terrorism Center at West Point. ’ ’   Szubin noted that ISIS is cutting benefits as it tries to deal   with a cash crunch. ’ ’’ ’   ”We received information earlier this year indicating that ISIL   stopped paying death benefits to families of ISIL personnel,”   Szubin said. ”That’’s a core benefit that a group like ISIL needs   to promise to the families of those going on suicide or likely   suicide missions in order to maintain their operational tempo.” ’ ’   ISIS is also relying more on taxation for revenue. ’ ’   ”We’’ve seen them significantly increase taxation rates and   increase the categories of activity they’’re now taxing,” Szubin   said. ”While they had once held off from taxing the poorest   civilians on humanitarian grounds, they are now taxing across the   board.” ’ ’   And the group is increasing rates and dipping into pensions,   according to Szubin. ’ ’   ”Where the rates might have once been 3% or 5% we see those   doubling, and we see them going after everything from income to   remittances to picking up pension payments,” Szubin said. ”Every   aspect of life is being taxed, including real estate.” ’ ’   Szubin also disputed the notion of    salary cuts   for ISIS fighters, speculating that its highly skilled workers   are probably still being paid the same while its foreign fighters   are likely suffering the most from the cutbacks. ’ ’   ”I have no doubt that ISIL continues to pay its chemical   engineers and the people who are advanced on the weapons side,   people who are helping it on the   side, the same   salaries they used to pay them,” Szubin said. ”The 50% pay cut is   probably for the foreign fighters or those who are in the second   or third ring, and it’’s a pretty significant pay cut.” ’ ’   Defections from ISIS are thought to be increasing as salaries   decrease. ’ ’   In its propaganda, ISIS paints a picture of a thriving   ”caliphate,” the name is uses for the territory it controls, but   many foreigners who have traveled there have returned to the West   disillusioned and with stories of extreme poverty and hardship in   ISIS areas. And local fighters  —   especially in Syria, where a   civil war is raging  —   will sometimes choose to join whichever   militia or group has the most resources. ’ ’   ”They have been able to attract unprecedented numbers of foreign   fighters to come join their cause based on two things,” Szubin   explained. ”One was battlefield success and this narrative that   they were moving towards establishing a caliphate. They no longer   have that. The last six months have been nothing but loss of   territory followed by loss of territory.” ’ ’   The second reason ISIS was able to grow so quickly was the   competitive salaries the group offered. ’ ’   ”Secondly, they were paying better than the going rate, more, for   example, than a civil servant could be expected to receive in a   place like Iraq and more than other militia groups were paying,”   Szubin said. ’ ’   ISIS is also seeing its oil revenues plummet as the US targets   tanker trucks. The military has also seen some success in   targeting cash storehouses. ’ ”   Despite ISIS’ financial woes, it doesn’t look like a total   collapse is imminent. But the group is struggling both   financially and militarily, and it no longer looks to be growing. ” ’   ”I do think they’’re feeling financial strain across the board,”   Szubin said. ”If you look at a number of the military fronts,   they’’re feeling strain there. I think they’’re feeling it in terms   of the public narrative. And they’’re feeling strain in terms of   the internal support by Sunni populations who have soured even   further on ISIL. They are back on their heels.” ’"
Why I’ve read the same book every year for the past 3 decades,"’’ ’Every year over the Christmas break, I have a ritual that I have adhered to for over 30 years. I dig out a copy of Dale Carnegie’’s ”” and read it.’ ”Yes, I’ve read it over 30 times now.” ”What more can I possibly learn from reading the same book after the second, third or fourth (or thirtieth) read? Well that’s the interesting part. Every single time I have read this book, I’ve learned something new, I’ve interpreted some of the information in a completely different light, I’m reminded about the key messages in the book that sometimes I forget amongst a busy life and last but not least, I get just as much enjoyment reading it today as I did the first time I read it.” ”In fact I   quite a few books. To me they are the classics of business,   and even fiction. Those books have been very influential on my life in so many ways. And I find the same with each and every one of them. Whilst there is a familiarity about them, I always learn something that I didn’t know before, that somehow I seemed to have missed in past readings. The reading experience is somehow different and the meaning I take from these books is likewise a little different in an interesting way.” ”Of course the reality is that the book hasn’t changed, I have. What is going on in my world at any specific time that I am reading the book is different. The trials and tribulations I am experiencing are not the same as they were last time. I’ve become older, hopefully a little more wise and it’s fair to assume I’ve had more life experiences that make me a different person, open to interpreting information in a different way.” ’Whilst this might not be for everyone,   those books that have had a profound influence on my life, over and over again, helps to keep me on track and inspires me to be a better entrepreneur and a better person. And I’’m hoping I get to read ”How to Win Friends and Influence People” at least another 30 times.’"
Pat Caddell: ’Politics Has Been Reduced to Tribal Warfare’,"Pollster and political analyst Pat Caddell joined Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Thursday to discuss the state of American politics, as well as the newly installed Trump administration and how “the legitimate dissent of the American people” led to his election.

First Look: Woody Allen-Miley Cyrus Series ’Crisis in Six Scenes’,"Amazon released the first trailer for its upcoming Woody     television series Crisis in Six Scenes on Wednesday. [The trailer gives viewers a closer look at Allen’s character Sidney Munsinger, a married suburbanite caught up in the social turmoil of the 1960s whose world is turned   by the arrival of Miley Cyrus’ hippie character.  “I don’t dislike you, just everything that you stand for,” she tells Munsinger in the trailer.  Crisis in Six Scenes marks Allen’s first serious foray into television. In an interview with USA Today at the Cannes Film Festival in France last year, Allen warned that the   series could wind up being a “cosmic embarrassment” for Amazon. “This was a catastrophic mistake for me. I’m struggling with it,” Allen told the outlet. “I never should have gotten into it. I thought it would be really easy, to do six  . I thought it would be a cinch. But it’s not. It’s very, very hard. ” Amazon was forced to defend its collaboration with Allen at the Television Critics Association Press tour shortly after the series was announced last year, after the auteur’s adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, leveled sexual assault allegations against him in a   open letter in the New York Times. “I think you have to look at the whole picture but  …     yeah, take everything into account, but our focus is on the fact that he is a great filmmaker and storyteller,” Amazon Studios head Roy Price told reporters when asked about the allegations against Allen. “And so we look forward to the show in 2016. ” Crisis in Six Scenes also stars Elaine May, Michael Rapaport, Lewis Black, Joy Behar, Rachel Brosnahan and John Magaro. The series begins streaming on Amazon Prime September 30.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum"
"Top Ex-Clinton Pollster: Dems Losing Working-Class Voters of ALL Races Due to Illegal Immigration, Trade - Breitbart","Former President Bill Clinton’s top pollster acknowledged that Democrats have been losing   voters of all races and backgrounds —  not just solely white   voters —  because the party’s elites support open borders, are soft on illegal immigration, and favor trade deals that screw American workers.  Stan Greenberg —  who has written extensively about the importance of   Reagan Democrats in places like Macomb County, Michigan —  declared that Democrats do not just have a “white   problem. ” Writing in the American Prospect, Greenberg notes that Democrats have lost support “with all   voters across the electorate, including the Rising American Electorate of minorities, unmarried women, and millennials” because of the party’s “seeming embrace of multinational trade agreements that have cost American jobs. ” In addition, he says “Democrats have moved from seeking to manage and champion the nation’s growing immigrant diversity to seeming to champion immigrant rights over” those of American citizens. “This decline contributed mightily to the Democrats’ losses in the states and Congress and to the election of Donald Trump,” he says, noting that Democrats have failed to “attack a political economy that works for the rich, big corporations, and the cultural elites, but not for average Americans. ” Voters, Greenberg points out, are worried “about the costs” that come with massive immigration, with 60 percent believing that granting legal status to illegal immigrants “would lead to greater competition for public services and more than half believe it would take jobs from American citizens. ” He points out that even a whopping “41 percent of Democrats think those immigrants would “take jobs from U. S. citizens” and half of Democrats believe granting legal status “would be a drain on government services. ” In the 2016 election, Trump hammered Clinton among white   voters, winning their voters by nearly 40 percentage points. Though   class men were most opposed to illegal immigration, Greenberg curiously reveals the inconvenient truth that Democrats should “not assume that African Americans do not share some of those concerns” for “many in our focus groups raise anxieties about competition from new immigrants. ” In addition, he says, “like the more conservative   whites, African American women place a high premium on faith in God and the need to put American citizens before immigrants. ” During the 2016 election, Jamelle Bouie acknowledged that it would not be a “bad play” for Trump to appeal to black workers with an immigration agenda that favors American workers. And Hillary Clinton’s support for amnesty programs may have turned off enough black voters to make Trump president. According to the Census, black Americans “showed the sharpest decline in voter turnout —   7. 1 percent since 2012. At 59. 6 percent, it was the lowest black turnout rate since 2000. ” Immigration may have also arguably been the reason that propelled trump to the GOP nomination. As Breitbart News    Joel Pollak has pointed out, on July 10, 2015, nine days after an illegal immigrant murdered Kate Steinle in San Francisco, Trump met with victims of illegal immigrant crime. Trump was in seventh then, trailing former Florida Governor Jeb Bush by 10 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of the polls. Nine days later, Trump rocketed into first place in the RealClearPolitics average and never looked back. Another Greenberg survey a month into Trump’s presidency found “how central concerns about immigration, borders, foreignness, and Islam were” to white   Trump voters in Macomb County, Michigan who had previously voted for Obama. These voters were convinced that Clinton and today’s Democrats wanted “open borders,” according to his surveys. Democrats have also been losing   voters because of trade. Greenberg notes “that separation grew wider with Obama’s battle for the   Partnership and with Trump making his opposition to it central to his vow to represent ‘the forgotten Americans. ’” “The Obama presidency produced a partisan realignment on trade, reinforcing the class and gender bases of the two parties that will disrupt the politics of both, if it hasn’t already,” he wrote. “Before 2008, Republicans were more supportive of NAFTA than Democrats, but at the end of Obama’s presidency, GOP support for NAFTA collapsed, pushed off the cliff by Trump. Democrats, on the other hand, became more favorably disposed to NAFTA. ” His surveys have discovered that the “white working class, who live amid the remains of the manufacturing sector in the industrial Midwest, strongly oppose these trade agreements with increasing ferocity, particularly the men who were disproportionately employed in manufacturing. ” During the 2016 campaign, Trump relentlessly opposed the   Partnership (TPP) deal and called out Clinton for waffling on it and never giving a clear answer about where she stood. One of Trump’s first actions as president was signing an executive order formally withdrawing the United States from the TPP. Greenberg also points out that   Americans of all backgrounds “pulled back from Democrats in this last period of Democratic governance because” of Obama’s “insistence on heralding economic progress and the bailout of the irresponsible elites, while ordinary people’s incomes crashed and they continued to struggle financially. ” Interestingly, according to Greenberg, Obama’s embrace of policies favored by elites who live in the country’s wealthiest zip codes did the party no favors with minority voters, who have been left behind in liberal cities like San Francisco and New York. “That is why the simple embrace of metropolitan America’s liberal values and economic elite hurt Democrats with   voters in both the big cities and in rural America,” he notes."
PC Mag: Banning Milo from Twitter Is a Super Bad Idea - Breitbart,"From Sascha Segan writing at PC Mag:  Twitter stepped neatly into Lord of the Shitlords Milo Yiannopolous’s trap this week by permanently banning him from the service, thereby justifying his entire thesis that he is a lone flag carrier for “free speech” being persecuted by powerful forces.   …     Although Milo has been involved in nearly every   harassment controversy on the Internet, for some inexplicable reason, Twitter decided to ban him yesterday for supposedly inciting the massive racial harassment of Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones. That reached a fever pitch after trolls apparently faked screenshots of Jones’s Twitter account to make it look like she was tweeting racist and   filth. Perhaps Milo is responsible for that, but only in the way dry timber is responsible for a forest fire. Banning Milo is like burning a witch and then saying you’ve done something about the plague. It makes him a scapegoat and a   martyr while doing absolutely zero about the broader problem he represents, which is widespread, anonymous, sexist, racist, and   abuse. Like a Mafia don in a friendly,   prison, Milo will have no problem ordering his legions from exile. In fact, his street cred has now improved. Read the rest of the story at PC Mag."
Neymar broke down in tears after scoring gold-medal-winning penalty kick for Brazil,"’  ’ ”   Brazil won its   Olympic gold medal in men’s soccer on   Saturday, beating Germany   in penalty kicks.  ” ”   Neymar, the team’s captain and the country’s biggest soccer   star, converted the fifth and final penalty kick to win the game.   Afterwards  —   indeed, almost at the exact moment the ball   appeared to cross the    —   Neymar broke down in tears like   we’ve never seen him before.  ” ”   Here’s Neymar:  ” ’  ’ ”   His teammates didn’t even have time to mob him before the tears   were pouring down his face:  ” ’  ’ ”   It’s a terrific moment  —   not just for Neymar, but for the entire   country. Brazil, somehow, had never won a gold medal in Olympic   men’s soccer, and to do it on their home turf is special.   What’s even more special is that they managed to do it   against Germany, the country that beat them in the World Cup   semifinal,   back in 2014. That game, remember, was also   in Brazil and considered a national embarrassment.  ” ”   The pressure on the Brazilian soccer players was enormous, and   nobody felt that more than Neymar. He faced harsh   criticism leading up to the Games, and throughout his side’s   lackluster start to the tournament the weight fell on his   shoulders. ” ”   But in the final, the Barcelona star showed why he’s one of the   best in the world. In the first half, he put the host nation   in the lead with a   free kick. The ball curled   over the wall and hit the bottom of the crossbar, bouncing down   and across the line. ” ’   The goalie had no chance, even if he was just fingertips away: ’ ’  ’ ’   Germany equalized in the second half, which set up the dramatics   in extra time and then penalty kicks. ’ ”   The decision to have Neymar shoot fifth was certainly a   questionable one. If a Brazilian player had missed, there   could have been a scenario in which Germany won and Neymar   wouldn’t even had had a chance to shoot. Imagine the   critics if that had happened. ” ”   Luckily, it didn’t. Instead, we get the ending to the Olympic   soccer that Brazil deserves.  ”"
Obama Drinks from Orange Cup to Support Gun Control Campaign - Breitbart,"June 2 is National Gun Violence Awareness day, which is a fancy way of saying Michael   Everytown for Gun Safety’s Day to #WearOrange for gun control. [Never one to miss out on the opportunity to push a curtailment of Second Amendment rights, Barack Obama took to Twitter to show his solidarity with the gun control cause. He held an orange coffee cup and tweeted, “On this National Gun Violence Awareness Day, let your voice be heard and show your commitment to reducing gun violence. ”  On this National Gun Violence Awareness Day, let your voice be heard and show your commitment to reducing gun violence. pic. twitter.   —   Barack Obama (@BarackObama) June 2, 2017,  During his two terms in the White House, Obama’s   Amendment stance drove background checks for gun sales sky high. Moreover, concealed carry surged under Obama as social unrest and the Democratic Party’s pursuit of gun control —  and complete gun bans —  flourished. May 2015 set a record for the most background checks of any May on record. Then June 2015 set the record the most background checks of any June on record. Then July, and August, September, November, and on and on. Every month set a record for 19 consecutive months beginning May 2015. By that point in Obama’s presidency it was clear that every   gun crime would be viewed as an opportunity to propose more gun control, even if the proposed gun control had nothing to do with the crime that spurred its introduction. We saw this with the Sandy Hook Elementary attack a horrific crime wherein the criminal stole his guns then killed 26 innocents in a   zone. Neither Obama nor his fellow Democrats said anything about removing the   zones that forced teachers to be sitting ducks, but they did recruit Senator Joe Manchin ( ) to push universal backgrounds (even though background checks have absolutely zero to do with an attack where the guns are stolen). Now it is June 2, 2017, and Obama is back —  with an orange cup —  pushing gun control.

[Williams walked on stage alongside her Get Out   Lil Rel Howery to present the Best Kiss award.  Before they announced the winners, the pair performed a skit that saw Howery jokingly stepping slowly away from Williams, as if in fear of the character the actress played in the   horror film. “What do I have to do to get back the trust?” Williams asked. The actress then suggested several ideas that might help her regain the confidence of the black community, like making it “illegal to ask ‘Can I touch your hair? ’” and offering to replace George Washington’s face on Mount Rushmore with the face of actor Denzel Washington. Howery turned down both ideas. Williams then suggested putting Beyonce’s latest album, “Lemonade,” on Spotify, to which Howery agreed.

"Rene Lima-Marin pardoned, still held by ICE"," (CNN) Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper on Friday pardoned Rene   a convicted armed robber who won the sympathy of immigrant groups and politicians by turning his life around after he was mistakenly released from prison. ”The case of Rene   presents an extraordinary set of facts,” the governor said. ”Mr.   committed serious crimes when he was much younger, and I believe he was justly convicted and punished for those crimes. To the extent rehabilitation is a goal of imprisonment, Mr.   appears to have achieved it.” But   is still behind bars.  Agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement took him into custody a few days ago. Hickenlooper’s pardon does not affect a 2000 removal order from an immigration judge, ICE spokesman Carl Rusnok said. But  ’s immigration lawyer hopes the pardon will make a difference. ”Rene’s immigration fight is still not over,” Hans Meyer’s office said. ”We still have critical and immediate work to do to prevent his deportation and reunite him with his family.  ”We hope that ICE will work with us to release Rene from custody and allow us to reopen his immigration case, restore his lawful permanent status, and reunite (him) with his family. Thanks to this important step by the governor, we are one step closer to reuniting Rene with his wife and children.” There is no timetable on when a federal judge could determine his removal, Rusnok said. It’s possible, he said, that an order of supervision could be issued instead. That would require   to report to ICE on a periodic basis and allow him to stay in the country.  Mistakenly freed,   is married with two children    one in elementary school, the other in middle school, his lawyers said Thursday. He came to the United States when he was 1 year old as part of the Mariel boatlift, the lawyers said.   was sentenced to 98 years for robbing two video stores in 1998.  In 2008, he was mistakenly released because of a paperwork error that said his sentences were to be served concurrently, instead of consecutively. He was rearrested in 2014, when authorities realized the mistake. In the six years he was free, he found a job, got married, started a family, and bought a home, said one of his lawyers, Kimberly Diego. ”His case was unique in that sense,” she said. ”Not all people who are rehabilitated behave that way.”  ’Asset to society’ In a   decision this week, Arapahoe County District Court Judge Carlos Samour Jr. ordered him to be released from prison. ”It would be utterly unjust to compel   at this juncture, to serve the rest of his extremely long sentence,” he wrote.    is an ”asset to society” and an ”outstanding citizen” who worked with young people and encouraged them to make good decisions, according to the judge’s ruling.    started his prison term in April 2000, after being found guilty of multiple counts of kidnapping, burglary, aggravated robbery and use of a deadly weapon during commission of a crime. While a gun was used in the   no shots were fired and no one was injured, according to the judge.    seemed on the cusp of freedom this week when the judge’s order was put into effect, but before he could walk out of the Colorado Department of Corrections, agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement took him into custody.  ’s wife, Jasmine, speaking Friday at a news conference, said the turn of events was very unexpected. ”We were pretty much preparing for a celebration that we’d been waiting for over three years,” she said. ”To have this happen, we just kind of feel like, for some reason, they want to keep our family apart.”  ’Case for redemption’  ’s complicated case drew heavy media attention in Colorado and there was widespread support for letting him out of prison. The Colorado House of Representatives, for instance, approved a resolution last month urging the governor to grant clemency to  . ”Rene’s case is a study in the case for redemption and for justice and fairness, particularly in our criminal justice system,” Meyer said at a Friday news conference.  ”It’s also a story about our state courts, and our state  justice system making one decision after years of litigation, agreeing that the just, the right, the constitutional thing is to reunite him with his family. And having ICE making the exact opposite decision in the 11th hour.” Meyer said it will be a miscarriage of justice if   is deported to Cuba, a country he barely knows. Governor’s pardon questioned, But 18th Judicial District Attorney George Brauchler maintains Hickenlooper circumvented the law when he pardoned  . Brauchler said   only applied for a commutation of his sentence, not for a pardon, as required by law. Brauchler also said Hickenlooper made ”no reasonable effort” to contact the judge who sentenced   for input, which the law also requires.  A statement from Brauchler’s office said the prosecutor doesn’t oppose the commutation of  ’s sentence and doesn’t believe he should be deported. But, ”I do not believe that   deserves to skip over the clemency and pardon procedures dozens of others have endured,” Brauchler said in statement.  ”The governor may exercise his discretion to pardon whomever he wants for whatever reasons he deems best, but only as the law permits. The law has requirements. The governor failed to meet those requirements,” Brauchler said. In his statement on  ’s pardon, Hickenlooper said the ”extraordinary circumstances of this case and Mr.  ’s demonstrated ability to live successfully in the community . .. it would be unjust for Mr.   to suffer further consequences for his convictions.”"
"Obama: Climate Change ’Could Mean No More Glaciers In Glacier National Park,’ Threaten the Statue of Liberty - Breitbart","During Saturday’s Weekly Address, President Obama stated, “the threat of climate change means that protecting our public lands and waters is more important than ever. Rising temperatures could mean no more glaciers in Glacier National Park. No more Joshua Trees in Joshua Tree National Park. Rising seas could destroy vital ecosystems in the Everglades, even threaten Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. ”  Transcript as Follows: “Hi everybody. Earlier this summer, Michelle, Malia, Sasha and I headed west —  to the national parks at Carlsbad Caverns and Yosemite. And I’ve got to say, it was a breath of fresh air. We explored hundreds of feet underground, standing beneath dripping stalactites in New Mexico. We hiked up a misty trail next to a waterfall in California. And I even took a few pictures of my own  —   not bad, right? But the truth is, no camera  —   especially one with me behind it  —   can fully capture the beauty and majesty of America’s national parks. From Glacier and Denali to Gettysburg and Seneca Falls, our more than 400 parks and other sites capture our history and our sense of wonder. As FDR once said: ‘There is nothing so American as our national parks  …     the fundamental idea behind the parks  …     is that the country belongs to the people.’ This month, we’re celebrating the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service. And I want to encourage all of you to ‘Find Your Park’ so that you and your family can experience these sacred places, too. If you’re a military family, you can even get in free through Michelle and Jill Biden’s Joining Forces initiative. And if you’ve got a fourth grader in your family, you can get a free pass, too, by going to EveryKidInAPark. org. I hope you do. Because all across the country, the National Park Service is preparing for a big year. We’re revitalizing a grove of giant Sequoias in Yosemite repairing the Lincoln Memorial and enhancing the iconic entrance to our first national park at Yellowstone. As President, I’m proud to have built upon America’s tradition of conservation. We’ve protected more than 265 million acres of public lands and waters  —   more than any administration in history. We’ve recovered endangered wildlife species and restored vulnerable ecosystems. We’ve designated new monuments to Cesar Chavez in California, the Pullman porters in Chicago, and the folks who stood up for equality at Stonewall in New York  —   to better reflect the full history of our nation. And we’ve got more work to do to preserve our lands, culture, and history. So we’re not done yet. As we look ahead, the threat of climate change means that protecting our public lands and waters is more important than ever. Rising temperatures could mean no more glaciers in Glacier National Park. No more Joshua Trees in Joshua Tree National Park. Rising seas could destroy vital ecosystems in the Everglades, even threaten Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. So in the coming years and decades, we have to have the foresight, and the faith in our future, to do what it takes to protect our parks and protect our planet for generations to come. Because these parks belong to all of us. And they’re worth celebrating  —   not just this year, but every year. Thanks everybody. Have a great weekend. And see you in the parks!” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"
Report Accuses Facebook of Gender Bias Against Female Developers - Breitbart,"A newly published report has accused Facebook of rejecting female developer’s code 35 percent more often than code written by male developers. [The Wall Street Journal reports that an engineer at Facebook gathered data last year showing that code written by women at the company was more frequently rejected than code written by male developers. The report apparently set off a debate within Facebook internally about possible gender bias within the Silicon Valley tech company. CEO Mark Zuckerberg was even asked about the report during a weekly town hall meeting.  Senior Facebook officials conducted their own review of the Facebook engineer’s report following the outcry. Facebook’s Head of Infrastructure, Jay Parikh, published an internal post a month after the review which attributed the rejection rate gap to the engineer’s rank and level of work rather than their gender. This was seen by many employees as evidence that female developers were not rising through the ranks of Google at the same rate as their male counterparts. A Facebook spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal that the initial analysis by the Facebook engineer was, “incomplete and inaccurate  —   performed by a former Facebook engineer with an incomplete data set. ” However, the spokesperson did confirm Mr. Parikh’s analysis, which was based on data unavailable to the majority of employees. The spokesperson also stated that there aren’t enough women at senior engineering levels at Facebook and across many Silicon Valley tech companies. Tracy Chou, a diversity advocate and former software engineer at Pinterest said, “especially for mass consumer products, there are just going to be blind spots. ” The engineer that conducted the report who has reportedly been at the company for several years stated that she conducted the analysis, “so that we can have an insight into how the review process impacts people in various groups. ” The engineer stated that she analyzed five years of data that she pulled from Facebook’s own open repository of   data.

It Took Obama Six Hours to Respond to Benghazi and Hillary Didn’t Find Him - Breitbart,"President Obama did not personally respond to Benghazi on the night of the attack until more than six hours after the White House convened an emergency conference call, according to   State Department records reviewed by Breitbart News. [Obama’s   absence, during which the United States military did not have presidential orders to enter Libyan airspace to potentially save Americans, was apparently not interrupted by Hillary Clinton.  A State Department Operations Center Watch Log noted that the White House convened a “NOIWON” at 1621 Military Time, or 4:21 PM Eastern Time, on September 11, 2012 to respond to the developing “attack” on the U. S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. “1621 The White House Situation Room convened a NOIWON, on behalf of the Watch, in which INR also participated, to report on an attack on the Diplomatic Mission in Benghazi,” according to the records. “NOIWON” stands for “National Operational Intelligence Watch Officer’s Network. ” A historycommons. org article on the   attacks defines NOIWON: A National Operations and Intelligence Watch Officer Network (NOIWON) conference call is established to allow government agencies in the Washington, DC, area to quickly share information regarding the ongoing events. But despite the White House acknowledging the emergency, Obama is nowhere to be found in the Watch records. The “ExecSec,” or Executive Secretary in the office of the Secretary of Defense, “visited the Watch” at 1635, or 4:35 PM. The Watch sent out three targeted alerts to various government agencies within the first hour. Finally, at 2227, or 10:27 PM, President Obama shows up in the Watch Log records. “2227 The Watch patched President Obama to the Secretary,” according to the records. The “Secretary” refers to Hillary Clinton. The secret records were obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request by attorney Mark Zaid on behalf of the group Veterans For a Strong America. “This is the watch log created by the State Department. The State Department has an operations center, and they maintain a log of all actions and communications that take place. This is the watch log, the record of communication, going in and out of the operations center,” Joel Arends, chairman of Vets For a Strong America, told Breitbart News. “For the president of the United States to have not interjected himself sooner in this process is a tragedy,” Arends said, noting that only President Obama could have obtained permission from the Libyan transitional government to use their airspace to send in the U. S. military. “Why did it never happen? Where was the president during this time?  …    He should have known that we had to request a formal order from the Libyan government to enter into their airspace,” Arends said. Arends thinks that Hillary Clinton should have intervened to find Obama. “Let’s ask the same questions of the Secretary herself. She’s a lawyer. Why wasn’t she pushing the president to fly Why did she never request presidential permission for our forces to fly into Libyan airspace?” Arends asked."
"NYT columnist: Yale detained my son, at gunpoint"," (CNN) As a noted memoirist and New York Times columnist who writes often about race, Charles Blow has spoken about the police killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, deaths that sparked a national debate over how police treat   men. On Monday, Blow wrote about another young black man’s encounter with police    his son, who was allegedly held at gunpoint on the Yale University campus where he’s a student. Blow took to Twitter on Sunday, writing that he was ”fuming” after his son called to tell him what happened Saturday    that he was walking out of the library when university police ”accosted” him and drew their weapons. Blow tweeted that his son was detained because he ”fit the description” of a suspect. Blow’s son was released, and Yale has said that the real suspect was found and arrested later. The columnist’s son was shaken. On Monday, Blow told CNN that his son is back in class and feeling better.  ”He’s a good kid, and just wants to go to school. But one thing that he told me was really astute and worth sharing: he doesn’t want this story to only be about him,” Blow said. ”He realizes that there are other young people who have fewer privileges, less access and endure even greater traumas, but whose stories go unreported until something truly tragic happens. He wants the focus to remain on them. I couldn’t be prouder of him for having the wisdom to recognize that.” Sunday night, the columnist was incredibly angry after he says his son called him to explain what happened. ”#I can’t breathe and #blacklives matter,” Blow posted in a series of tweets. ”This is exactly why I have NO PATIENCE for ppl trying to convince me that the fear these young blk men feel isn’t real #RacialBattleFatigue,” the columnist wrote in tweets that were shared hundreds of thousands of times. Yale released a statement Monday that said Blow’s son was detained in the vicinity of a reported crime, and that he closely matched the physical description of the suspect. ”Let us be clear: we have great faith in the Yale Police Department and admire the professionalism that its officers display on a daily basis to keep our campus safe. What happened . .. is not a replay of what happened in Ferguson Staten Island Cleveland or so many other places in our time and over time in the United States. The officer, who himself is African American, was responding to a specific description relayed by individuals who had reported a crime in progress,” it read. The statement continued: ”Even though the officer’s decision to stop and detain the student may have been reasonable, the fact that he drew his weapon during the stop requires a careful review.” The school promised to share the results of that investigation with the broader community. On Sunday, Yale spokeswoman Karen Peart wrote in email that Yale police responded to an emergency call from undergraduates in a residential community on campus, saying that someone had ”entered their rooms under false pretenses, pretending to be looking for someone.”  Students in the same community had been burglarized that week, Peart explained, and the police were looking for someone who was ”a tall,     student wearing a black jacket and a red and white hat.” The real suspect was later found on an adjacent residential community, was arrested and is expected to face felony burglary charges, according to Peart. Blow declined Sunday to talk to CNN about the incident, but he gave a detailed account in his Times column of what his son said happened.  When his son was leaving the Yale library around 5:45 p. m. Saturday, he saw an officer ”jogging” toward the entrance of another building across the grounds. Blow’s son recounted to his father that he started walking back to his dorm when he noticed a police officer following him and then speaking into his radio, saying, ”I got him.” The officer shouted, ”Hey, turn around!” according to Blow’s recounting of his son’s story.  The officer raised his gun and told the college student to get on the ground. Blow’s son, the columnist writes, dropped to his knees, raised his hand and laid down on his stomach. He was then asked for his name and where he went to school.  The student answered, according to the columnist. Then the officer told him to get up, gave the student his name and told the student to call him the next day, according to the column’s retelling. Then Blow’s son said he got up and started to walk back to his dorm.  According to Blow, his son told him: ”’I was scared. My legs were shaking slightly. After a few more paces, the officer, ’Hey, my man. Can you step off to the side?’ ” The student did as he was told. Then one officer asked him to turn around to get a better view of the jacket the student was wearing. The officer asked for the student’s name again and his ID. Blow’s son complied, according to the columnist. Then the officer held him longer, asking more questions, Blow writes.  ”Now, don’t get me wrong: If indeed my son matched the description of a suspect, I would have had no problem with him being questioned appropriately,” Blow wrote in the Times. ”School is his community, his home away from home, and he would have appreciated reasonable efforts to keep it safe. The stop is not the problem the method of the stop is the problem.” Blow wrote that the dean of Yale and the university police chief have apologized to him.  But he wants answers.  ”Why was a gun drawn first? Why was he not immediately told why he was being detained? Why not ask for ID first? What if my son had panicked under the stress, having never had a gun pointed at him before, and made what the officer considered a ’suspicious’ movement? Had I come close to losing him?  ”Triggers cannot be unpulled. Bullets cannot be called back,” Blow wrote. ”This is the scenario I have always dreaded: my son at the wrong end of a gun barrel, face down on the concrete,” he added. ”I had always dreaded the moment that we would share stories about encounters with the police in which our lives hung in the balance, intergenerational stories of joining the inglorious ’club.’ ”"
Van Jones: Trump Won Rust Belt Because of Dems ’Arrogance and Elitism’ - Breitbart,"Thursday on ABC’s “The View,” former Obama administration green jobs czar and CNN contributor Van Jones said Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton lost to   Donald Trump because Democrats’ “arrogance and elitism,” caused them to ignore the suffering in the rust belt states.  Partial transcript as follows: JONES: There’s more going on than the media has gotten to. There’s heartbreak all around and we got to start listening to each other. GOLDBERG: But here’s my question. Now that we are starting to see the plans and the people Donald’s putting in, how is this going to affect them? Because you know, all of the things that these families have put their hopes and dreams on him  —   JONES: Listen, tell you what, they’re going to be patient with Donald Trump because they’ve been waiting for a long time. And I’m going to tell you something as a liberal, when those factories started closing, did the NAACP come help? Did Green Peace? Did the National Organization for Woman, did any liberal group come? We as liberals can’t be mad. We didn’t ask them for a date. We didn’t try to say come with me to dinner. So then Donald Trump shows up and takes them out and now we’re mad. BEHAR: How do you account for the fact that she has 2. 5 million more popular votes than he then? JONES: It was the weakness in the rust belt. That’s where she lost it. I was saying back in June —  those   blue states are hanging by a thread and nobody went there to fix it. BEHAR:  They didn’t agree. They didn’t see it. When I interviewed Nancy Pelosi, I said what if he wins, she said ‘he’s not going to win.’ JONES: Arrogance and elitism, and I love Nancy Pelosi. Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN"
Netanyahu: We Must Retain West Bank to ’Assure Our Existence’,"The Times of Israel reports: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday said that Israel must maintain its military control over the West Bank in the event of a peace agreement with the Palestinians. [“The idea that we can give up territory and achieve peace is not right,” Netanyahu told Army Radio in a   holiday interview. “In order to assure our existence we need to have military and security control over all of the territory west of the Jordan [River],” he said, reaffirming his commitment to a policy that is rejected by Palestinians, who seek a full Israeli withdrawal from the territory.  In the radio interview, Netanyahu asserted the root of the conflict lies not with Israeli settlements in the West Bank, but rather in Palestinian intransigence regarding recognition of Jewish rights to any part of the land.

My husband and I had been trying to conceive for a long time and during a difficult year, so I held off looking at the stick for as long as I could to give it plenty of time to think about its answer. While I was showering, a beautiful magenta plus sign materialized. I ran into our bedroom and pounced on my   husband with a cry of joy. I tried to speak but ruined the moment by squeaking out the news in a choked, shrill voice. As I cried, he held me and called me sweetheart. We were both so happy. Like many   I have an app for just about every important thing in my life. I have a health tracker that I ignore, a budget tracker that I ignore, an app to pay my bills that I try to ignore, and a period tracker that I’m obsessed with. Every week, I religiously tracked my mood on the period tracker along with my core temperature, the viscosity of various fluids, how often my husband and I were having sex, if sperm was present, etc. The app had more intimate knowledge of my reproductive behavior than my husband or any doctor. On the day of my positive pregnancy test, I logged into my period tracker to share the good news. When I did, it suggested a pregnancy app that I downloaded immediately. It was full of bright colors and interactive graphics. The app used words like zygote and blastocyst, which were not Pokémon names but developmental stages where brain stems or cell clusters form what would eventually become ears, kneecaps, nostrils, toes, lips and everything else. With a quick tap on the screen, I could see how big my baby’s hands were, look ahead to what new and weird things my body would do in the coming days and weeks, and read blogs from new and seasoned mothers. All it asked of me was some basic personal information: email, address, age and date of my last period. I typed in all that info without a second thought. According to my app, my baby was the size of a lavender bud: tiny, perfect and mine. I miscarried a month later. It happened around 2 a. m. on Dec. 27, two days after our Christmas Day announcement to our families that we were expecting. I had the perfect miscarriage. I’m not just saying that the doctor used those exact words while she had her hand between my legs. At home, my body had shed the pregnancy, and my uterus had already tilted back into   position. The doctor assured me that in a day or two the swelling would be gone and everything would be back to normal. She was impressed. I tried to feel flattered, but I’ve never been good at taking compliments. “Thanks,” I said. The doctor had been treating me as if I were made of glass. When I described the mass I’d passed earlier that could have fit in my cupped palm, she winced with empathy and confirmed that it was unlikely that they could have saved the pregnancy. “Yes,” I’d said in response. “I assumed so. ” Then she asked me a third time if my husband knew where I was. I didn’t blame her for her concern. My hair was unwashed, and I was swimming in my husband’s dirty sweats. I had already made a 3 a. m. Walmart run for feminine products and spent hours rotating between my room, the couch and the bathroom trying to ease my labor pains while I waited for the clinic to open at 10 a. m. Yes, I was fine, I told the doctor, again. Yes, my husband knew I was pregnant. I hadn’t thought he would need to accompany me to get checked out, but I made a mental note to bring him with me if I ever went through this again. After the doctor left, the nurse asked me if I was O. K. I assured her I was fine. I spent the next few weeks assuring people I was fine. “One in three first pregnancies ends in miscarriage,” I would say. Or, “I never really felt pregnant. ” Which was true. The most seemingly real thing about my pregnancy, oddly enough, had been the lavender bud avatar on my pregnancy app that had grown to the size of a chocolate chip before dying. When I got home from the clinic, I opened the app and terminated my virtual pregnancy with the touch of a button. The app immediately responded with a consoling email and cleared my data. It was then, when the chocolate chip avatar disappeared, that I finally let go and cried. As the months passed, I felt less and less fine about the miscarriage. It wasn’t that I had affected serenity or acceptance at the time. (I’d truly felt in control and somewhat detached.) I was grateful that my body had done exactly what it was designed to do. But as time wore on, I found myself crying at unexpected moments or talking too defensively when someone who was unaware asked if my husband and I were going to try to have children. Meanwhile, all those milestones I had been anticipating came and went: first ultrasound, hearing the heartbeat, fingernail development, the gender reveal and so on. Had I been pregnant, each phase would have filled me with excitement, trepidation and wonder. As each   ticked by, I lay awake at night imagining the little chocolate chip growing to the size of a walnut and then a peach as the sadness descended upon me and remained until I fell asleep. I hadn’t realized, however, that when I had entered my information into the pregnancy app, the company would then share it with marketing groups targeting new mothers. Although I logged my miscarriage into the app and stopped using it, that change in status apparently wasn’t passed along. Seven months after my miscarriage, mere weeks before my due date, I came home from work to find a package on my welcome mat. It was a box of baby formula bearing the note: “We may all do it differently, but the joy of parenthood is something we all share. ” I took the box inside and read the congratulatory card that gently urged    mothers toward formula feeding. I pulled out the various types of formula and wondered about the nutritional quality of a product that could sit in the sun for hours before being consumed by a brand new  . After packing the formula back into the box, I snapped a picture and texted it to my best friend. “Well, the internet still thinks I’m pregnant,” I wrote. “Maybe the mailman now, too. ” Then I laughed, because what else could I do? It seemed ludicrous that the only remaining evidence of my pregnancy was an erroneously sent product I’d never intended to use from people I had never told at a company I’d never heard of. My husband and I had been careful to tell just close friends and family of our pregnancy. We hadn’t wanted to share the news beyond that tight circle until we were past the first trimester, for obvious reasons: We hadn’t wanted to explain ourselves if anything had gone wrong. After spending months carefully managing our news, it was the internet, of all things, that bungled our plan. The same internet that seems to know everything about us  —   what TV shows we watch, which bras I prefer, what our political and religious affiliations are  —   had no idea that our baby had died. This might have upset me. Instead, I laughed. And I found comfort in the laughter. Part of me liked the idea that a   entity like the internet, which is so intimately involved in every trivial aspect of our lives, had completely missed the most important news of all. I also liked that our baby remained a piece of living data to someone. As far as the internet is concerned, my pregnancy proceeded normally and I gave birth and became a mother last month. Two years from now, it will probably assume I’m dealing with potty training and send me samples of training pants. And in five years, it will surely come calling with offers of school supplies for my kindergarten student. Where will it end? Someday it may think I’m panicking about an insufficient college fund and then express concern about whether or not my husband and I are embracing our empty nest. In the end, though, it’s this thought I like most: My little chocolate chip, long since deleted, is indeed out there somewhere, drifting around in cyberspace, endlessly trolling the internet."
Bill Clinton Went There: ’We Are All Mixed-Race’ - Breitbart,"While Hillary Clinton is looking to clinch the Democratic nomination with strong support from black voters in southern states, her husband Bill Clinton’s recent comments may end up alienating them. [During a campaign rally in Tennessee Friday, the former president was introduced by Rep. Steve Cohen as a “  for the first black president. ”  Bill Clinton took the joke and ran with it, asking the audience, “You know what we learned from the human genome?” “We learned that unless your ancestors, every one of you, are 100 percent, 100 percent from   Africa, we are all   people,” Bill Clinton said.  President Clinton (not to be outdone by actress Meryl Streep, who just days earlier told reporters in Berlin that “we’re all Africans“) also said President Barack Obama wasn’t a “ ” like his wife Hillary Clinton. The Clinton campaign still boasts a double digit lead over the socialist Senator Bernie Sanders. But signs suggest Sanders is cutting into that lead with a growing ground game, according to liberal MSNBC reporter   Reid. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson"
NYPD mourns a messenger of forgiveness," (CNN) New York Police Detective Steven McDonald may never have known the impact he made on others, but he wasn’t great at getting attention anyway. Watch ”New Day” and ”CNN Newsroom” each Friday to see inspiring stories of officers going above and beyond the call of duty. ”My dad was the most humble person, it was never about him,” said his son, Conor McDonald. Last month, thousands of mourners crowded New York streets and overpasses as McDonald’s body traveled from his home on Long Island to St. Patrick’s Cathedral. His funeral was officiated by Cardinal Timothy Dolan and attended by hundreds of members of the NYPD and New York City government. His wife, Patti Ann McDonald, said, ”Knowing what he went through 30 years after he was injured. (The funeral) was beautiful. The city, the outpouring of support, I was speechless.” Stunning act of forgiveness, Three decades ago, Steven McDonald was a new cop with the NYPD.  He was on patrol in Central Park when he questioned a group of teens. One of them, a    boy, shot McDonald three times. A bullet pierced McDonald’s spine and he was paralyzed from the neck down. Doctors gave him five years to live.  McDonald remained hospitalized for months, while Patti Ann gave birth to Conor. On the day of Conor’s baptism, McDonald publicly forgave his attacker, charting a new course for his life. ”I wanna forgive the kid that shot me,” he said.  McDonald’s act of forgiveness came less than a year after the shooting. ”When he decided to forgive, some people didn’t agree with him,” recalled Patti Ann. ”But, in order for him to move forward, to let go what was inside, he needed to.” McDonald brought his message of forgiveness, faith and love to   schools and church groups. He also traveled around the world to   communities in places like Northern Ireland, Bosnia and Israel.  ”He spoke with President Reagan, met with Pope John Paul II and Nelson Mandela, and    in 2015    saw Pope Francis in Central Park, not far from where his life changed forever,” said NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill at the funeral. The family said McDonald would hand out cards with a poem titled, ”You are special” to fellow police officers, reminding them to protect and serve, and to always return home safely. ”We still get notes with pictures of those original cards from people who were touched by my father,” said Conor, ”I would come home and say, ’Dad, you don’t know how important you are’ and he would say, ’I’m just doing my thing. ’” In the McDonald home, there is a wall filled with pictures of some of McDonald’s memories and travels. One, in particular, is Conor’s favorite. It’s shows Patti Ann holding a baby Conor up to his father, their foreheads touching. ”My dad and I would rub our heads together, because we couldn’t hug,” Conor said. ”That’s how we’d show affection toward each other. We’d do that until the day he died.” A family united by service, In 2010, like his father, Conor joined the NYPD. He recently was promoted to the rank of sergeant. It was the bond between Conor and his father that Patti Ann said was Steven’s greatest accomplishment. The two McDonald men could often be found   at Madison Square Garden, both loyal fans of hockey’s New York Rangers. ”He and I weren’t afforded the opportunity to play catch, throw a ball, or pass the puck around. We were just   it was the greatest experience,” Conor remembered. ”When the Rangers won, my dad could walk again.”  In the   season, the New York Rangers established the Steven McDonald Extra Effort Award in his honor.  And on the evening of McDonald’s funeral, the New York Rangers again honored Steven for his loyalty and life.  Rangers fans participated in a standing ovation, while Conor and Patti Ann dropped the puck for the team’s game.  A standing cheer for a man who    despite his appearance    had no limitations. He was a father, husband and hero, who devoted his life to others, up until his last breath. ”I truly believe he is in a better place,” Patti Ann said. ”He’s not suffering or in pain. He’s walking and he’s free.”"
"76ers Apologize for Axing BLM Protester, Invite Her Back to Sing Anthem - Breitbart","Friday the Philadelphia 76ers apologized to soloist Sevyn Streeter for canceling her singing of “The Star Spangled Banner” at their home opener for wearing a “We Matter”  . [The club   Streeter to come back to sing the national anthem saying that they were “sorry that this happened. ” Wearing a shirt that said “We matter,” the singer told the Associated Press that the team axed her performance just moments before she was about to sing.   According to the NBA official website, the Sixers released a statement Friday which said: “We are sorry that this happened.  After receiving feedback from our players, basketball operations staff and ownership group, we believe that the wrong decision was made, and Sevyn should have been welcomed to sing. We apologize to her, and in an effort to move the conversation forward, we have reached out to offer her an opportunity to return and perform at a game of her choice. We are waiting to hear back. ” Streeter explained to the AP in a phone interview, ”I’d say two minutes before we were about to walk out   …     the organization told me that I could not wear my shirt while singing the national anthem at their game. ’’ She complained that she was never given a  specific dress code, nor asked to show her wardrobe before her performance. ESPN reported that   entertainers must sign a contract which is subject to cancellation if the 76ers deem that the performance does not meet the standards described in the agreement. Streeter admitted the entire episode has been disturbing and tweeted Wednesday night: Was suppose to sing the anthem at  @sixers  @okcthunder game but mins b4 @sixers said I couldn’t because I was wearing a ”We Matter” jersey pic. twitter.   —   Sevyn (@sevyn) October 27, 2016,  She has since expressed that she “was angry  —   extremely, extremely angry  —   and disappointed and honestly brought to tears by all of it.

I was really looking forward to that. ” The   joins protesters such as San Francisco 49ers quarterback Collin Kaepernick and national anthem singer Denasia Lawrence  in using the anthem as a platform to express their dissatisfaction with America. Streeter said that ”it was important to express the ongoing challenges and ongoing injustice we face as a black community within the United States of America  —   that’s very important to me. ” She added, “Yes, we live in the greatest country in the world, but there are issues that we cannot ignore. This can’t be ignored. ”"
Reuters: Trump Support Edges Higher in Wake of Orlando - Breitbart,"The latest polling data from Reuters finds voters shifting support to Donald Trump in the days following the Orlando terrorist attack. [Prior to the attack, Hillary Clinton led Trump by almost 15 points in the Reuters tracking survey. In the latest results, Clinton leads Trump by 10 points.  The results run counter to the media narrative since the terrorist attack in Florida. Politico, for example, has run    stories this week exploring how Trump “flubbed” his response to the attack. Voters, however, don’t simply look at snap political statements in the wake of significant events to gauge candidates. The specifics of events themselves can shift the political landscape. The Reuters survey is based on a   rolling average of interviews with around 1, 200 likely voters. Most polls capture a   of the race within a small window of time. Many of the polls released this week included a large number of interviews conducted prior to the Orlando attack. The overwhelming majority of interviews in the widely cited Bloomberg poll earlier this week, for example, were conducted before the terrorist attack. That survey showed Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump by 12 points. The poll was released, of course, after the country was reeling from the aftermath of the Orlando attack and was breathlessly reported by the media as somehow reflecting the state of the race. The poll itself, though, was outdated as soon as Omar Mateen murdered 49 people in his own act of jihad. Terrorism has shot back to the top of voters’ concerns since the Orlando attack. In early May, terrorism was a distant third on the issues most important to voters, according to Reuters data. It was essentially tied with a host of other issues, including healthcare, unemployment and immigration. By   however, terrorism was again the number one issue on voters’ minds, edging out concerns over the economy. All other issues, like healthcare and immigration, had slipped to the   digits. Support for a temporary ban on Muslims also increased. Today, a plurality of voters support a ban on Muslim immigration into the US. A small majority of likely voters support a ban. At the end of May, a solid majority of voters opposed such a ban. Practically speaking, a blanket ban, even temporary, on Muslim immigration into the U. S. is unworkable. It is hard to imagine how such a policy could be crafted or implemented. It would likely be tied up in litigation long before it came into effect. Indeed, House Republican Speaker Paul Ryan, showing the aggressivness Republicans only show to each other, threatened to sue a President Trump over such a proposal. That said, a ban is supported by a large segment of voters. Politically, it is a split decision, with equal numbers of voters supporting and opposing a ban. This alone speaks volumes about the frustrations and distrust voters have with political leaders today. A blanket ban, after all, makes sense if one doesn’t trust the government or political leaders to enforce existing laws or pursue potential threats with the necessary vigor. The attack by Omar Mateen exposed, again, multiple failures of law enforcement or federal authorities to recognize potential threats. A blanket ban simply saves us the consequences of future bad decisions by federal authorities. With terrorism catapulting back to the top of voters’ concerns and support for a ban on Muslim immigrants increasing, it isn’t surprising that Trump has gained in the polls this week. Events like the Orlando terrorist attack shape a Presidential campaign far more than the   statements and punditry that fills cable news hours. Hillary Clinton’s strong showing in polls conducted before the Orlando attack also weren’t surprising. She had finally “won” her primary against Vermont socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to the media. Her campaign was enveloped by warm headlines about this or that national Democrat figure endorsing her campaign in the wake of her victory. Her campaign “success” was the story of last week, just as Trump’s primary campaign success was story in the final weeks of May. Trump got a poll bump in the wake of his victory, just as Hillary Clinton was receiving a bump from her win. And, then, Orlando happened. Former UK Prime Minister Harold Macmillan was famously asked by a journalist what could derail his government’s plans. “Events, my dear boy, events,” Macmillan is alleged to have responded. A great deal of a Presidential campaign is already “baked into the cake,” because of particular demographics, partisan loyalties, the overall economy and unique features of each candidate. Outside   though, can change the trajectory. The financial crash in late 2008 altered that election in ways that couldn’t have been forseen. The Orlando attack is already changing the opening days of the general election. Hillary Clinton was set to dominate polling for at least a few weeks following her primary win. Her polling honeymoon, however, seems to have ended just days after she left the Democrat alter. Orlando was certainly an event. It may have sparked another change in the Presidential race."
"Election Recount, Fidel Castro: Your Monday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1.   Donald Trump was criticized from across the political spectrum for his baseless claim on Twitter that he lost the popular vote because millions cast ballots illegally. California’s top election official called the allegations absurd and said Mr. Trump’s “reckless tweets are inappropriate and unbecoming. ” Mr. Trump made the claim after Hillary Clinton’s campaign agreed to participate in a recount effort in Wisconsin and possibly two other states. ____ 2. Mr. Trump has resumed holding transition meetings at his headquarters in New York, Trump Tower, which has been heavily fortified as a kind of White House North. As suspense continued over whether Mitt Romney would be chosen for secretary of state, Mr. Trump set up meetings with two other possibilities: the retired Gen. David Petraeus, above, and Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. We took a close look at Steve Bannon, the incendiary figure whom Mr. Trump appointed as chief White House strategist. Mr. Bannon once told a colleague that Mr. Trump was an “imperfect vessel” for the revolution he had in mind. But they bonded anyway. ____ 3. Cuba began nine days of mourning for Fidel Castro, only to be jarred by Mr. Trump’s threat on Twitter to “terminate deal” to normalize diplomatic relations. It is now up to Fidel’s brother, Raúl Castro, who assumed presidential powers in 2006, to steer the country. Their sister, an outspoken critic of Fidel Castro living in Miami, had not spoken to him in decades but was nonetheless upset by exiles’ celebrations of his death. Here’s our full obituary of Fidel Castro. ____ 4. Syrian rebels lost a large stretch of territory in the city of Aleppo to government forces and Kurdish fighters, a possible turning point in the grinding civil war. Residents described horrifying scenes of people being killed by shells as they searched for shelter. They said it was the heaviest bombardment yet in years of war. “It’s like doomsday,” one activist said. ____ 5. Nine people were injured on the campus of Ohio State University when a student drove his car onto the sidewalk and then stabbed several people with a butcher knife. The attacker, identified as Abdul Artan, 18, was shot dead within about a minute by a campus police officer. ____ 6. A federal judge granted Dylann Storm Roof’s request to represent himself in his capital trial on charges of killing nine   churchgoers in Charleston, S. C. That means the avowed white supremacist could   survivors of the massacre and family members of the dead. Mr. Roof has offered to plead guilty to the 33 charges against him in exchange for a life sentence. ____ 7. Officials in sanctuary cities across the country are gearing up to oppose Mr. Trump if he follows through on his campaign promise to deport millions of illegal immigrants. They say they will continue to limit local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration agents. In doing so, they risk losing federal funding. “We are not going to use our resources to enforce what we believe are unjust immigration laws,” the mayor of Oakland, Calif. said. ____ 8. In the coal country of West Virginia, where Mr. Trump pummeled Mrs. Clinton, Appalachians are eyeing Washington with a feeling they have not had in years: hope. That’s despite the predictions that coal will never come back and that the only way to revive the economy is to diversify it. “I don’t think he can ever fulfill all the promises he made even in four or eight years,” said one man who lost his job at a coal company last year. “But I think we’re headed in the right direction. ” ___ 9. A Cold War battle playing out in Lower Manhattan for the last three weeks  —   through the medium of chess  —   will last another game. Sergey Karjakin, a Russian, left, and Magnus Carlsen, a Norwegian and the defending world champion, ended the final regulation game in the    World Chess Championship in a draw. They will meet again to try to break the tie on Wednesday. ___ 10. Finally, what’s worth watching tonight? Our answer: Two HBO documentaries that capture Cuba on the brink of change (good time to watch!) and “Don’t Look Back,” D. A. Pennebaker’s chronicle of Bob Dylan’s 1965 British concert tour, which is streaming on Filmstruck. ___ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

Glenn Beck General Manager Blasts ‘Unfortunate Fabrications’ about Brad Thor Interview - Breitbart,"Glenn Beck linked on his Facebook page to the following statement from the general manager of his radio show, Dom Theodore, about Beck’s suspension from SiriusXM over comments made during an interview with the author Brad Thor that SiriusXM said “may be reasonably construed by some to have been advocating harm against” Donald Trump. [Theodore defends Beck’s comments from “unfortunate fabrications” and affirmed that Beck “has never  —   and will never  —   advocate violence. ” He claims that they “have been told that Glenn will be back on the Patriot Channel on Monday morning,” but also notes: “We have been preparing for an assault on Glenn’s voice, and others like it, which only reaffirms the importance and value of independent platforms like TheBlaze, platforms governed not only by ratings but also by principles and values. ”  Read the full statement below: Glenn is on vacation so I wanted to respond on his behalf so that the unfortunate fabrications surrounding his interview with Brad Thor don’t spread any further. As every listener of the show knows, Glenn has never  —   and will never  —   advocate violence. It wasn’t long ago that he was criticized by some for advocating peace during the Bundy Ranch saga. Glenn is a firm believer in Martin Luther King’s approach to affecting change, not Malcolm X’s. This past summer, he organized an event in Birmingham, Alabama called Restoring Unity, the purpose of which was to unite different groups to commit to come together. Again, Glenn has never advocated violence. His interview with Brad Thor speaks for itself. You can listen to it in its entirety here: Listen to Glenn and his cohosts discuss “fallout” from the interview the day after the interview here: This viral hatchet job is based on 49 seconds out of a   interview that gives no context of the hypothetical posited from by Brad Thor, a thriller writer. Glenn is on the record, repeatedly, expressing concern for all people, especially the President of the United States. With every scandal at the Secret Service, Glenn has implored his audience to pray for the safety of the President and for the restoration of the Secret Service’s judgement and abilities. And to answer the question before it has been asked: No one from any governmental agency, Secret Service, police force, etc. has been in contact with our company about this story in any way, shape, or form. For the past several months, Glenn has warned his audience, and anyone else willing to listen, that the current political climate is worse than anything he has ever witnessed or studied in American history. We have been preparing for an assault on Glenn’s voice, and others like it, which only reaffirms the importance and value of independent platforms like TheBlaze, platforms governed not only by ratings but also by principles and values. We are grateful to our partners at Premiere Networks, our many local affiliates, and all of our extended partners who support and celebrate a diversity of opinion. We hope you will reach out to all of them and thank them for having the backbone and integrity to   for all voices, even those with which they may disagree. We look forward to standing with our partners and affiliates to support a vibrant “marketplace of ideas” and will continue to refuse to engage in the manipulative and bullying tactics of progressives. The Glenn Beck Radio Program is distributed by Premiere Networks. What happens from here is between Premiere and SiriusXM. We have been told that Glenn will be back on the Patriot Channel on Monday morning. Only time will tell. At Mercury Radio Arts, we endeavor to take people at their word and will do so here. In the meantime, Glenn will continue to enjoy his vacation. Please tune in Monday at 9AM EST to hear Glenn’s thoughts on these events directly from him. The Glenn Beck Program is available through your local affiliates, TheBlaze Radio Network (via the iHeart Media app) and, presumably, the Patriot Channel. If you feel so inclined, we invite you to contact SiriusXM to let them know that the voices in support our shared principles and values are louder than those who would attempt to suppress them. The following passage from Beck’s interview with Thor sparked the controversy: THOR: He is a danger to America and I got to ask you a question and this is serious and this could ring down incredible heat on me because I’m about to suggest something very bad. It is a hypothetical I am going to ask as a thriller writer. With the feckless, spineless Congress we have, who will stand in the way of Donald Trump overstepping his constitutional authority as President? If Congress won’t remove him from office, what patriot will step up and do that if, if, he oversteps his mandate as president, his   authority, I should say, as president. If he oversteps that, how do we get him out of office? And I don’t think there is a legal means available. I think it will be a terrible, terrible position the American people will be in to get Trump out of office because you won’t be able to do it through Congress. BECK: I would agree with you on that and I don’t think you actually have the voices we’ve been talking about and we’ve been talking about this   for a while. I think the voices like ours go away. I don’t think we are allowed  —   especially if things, and I believe the economy is going to go to crap, even if Jesus was in office. It’s going to naturally reset. It has to. You can read the full transcript of the exchange here. You can read the full transcript of Beck and his  ’ subsequent defense of Thor’s comments here. This is the second controversy to engulf Beck over comments he made on air about Trump, who he has repeatedly compared to Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. In March, the Secret Service investigated Beck due to a joke he made with his   about “stabbing,” which initial reports claimed were in reference to Trump."
"Exclusive — Bernie Sanders, Other Top Democrats Refuse to Condemn Supporter FBI Alleges Made Anti-Semitic Threats Nationwide - Breitbart","WASHINGTON, D. C.  —   Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a member of the U. S. Senate Democratic leadership team, has thus far refused to condemn a supporter of his who is in FBI custody facing charges for alleged involvement in a string of   threats nationwide. [Breitbart News can exclusively confirm that a spokesman for Sanders, Josh Miller Lewis, is personally aware of the fact that one of the Senator’s supporters is in FBI custody on charges relating to the string of   threats nationwide. When news broke early Friday that Juan Thompson, a Sanders voter who was formerly a reporter with The Intercept who was terminated for pushing fake news and fabricating sources, was arrested, Breitbart News reached out to Sanders’ office for comment.  The first   email to Sanders’ office was sent at 11:28 a. m. Eastern on Friday morning. It included an attachment, a screen grab of Thompson’s Tweet from last summer admitting he voted for Sanders. The email asked if Sanders would condemn Thompson with the revelation that Thompson is in FBI custody for alleged connection to and involvement with dozens of bomb threats against a hundred Jewish Community Centers, schools, and museums nationwide. Miller Lewis, the deputy communications director in Sanders’ U. S. Senate office, replied asking for a link to the Tweet. I voted for Bernie Sanders, but his supporters are annoying as fuck. ”I almost cried when I got a Bernie sign”. Yuck. #DemsInPhilly,  —   Juan M. Thompson (@JuanMThompson) July 26, 2016,  “Do you have a link?” Miller Lewis wrote back to Breitbart News’s request for comment. Breitbart News sent him a link to Thompson’s Tweet and gave Sanders all day to respond. Breitbart News followed up with Miller Lewis at 1:35 p. m. 3:59 p. m. 5:49 p. m. and 5:52 p. m. asking whether Sanders will condemn the alleged   actions by Thompson. He has not responded to any of those inquiries. A quick scan of Sanders’ Twitter accounts —  both his campaign account and his official Senate account —  shows no mention of his supporter Thompson or any condemnation of the threats. There is no statement on Sanders’ campaign website and no statement or mention of the matter on his U. S. Senate website either. Sanders is hardly the only Democrat who has gone silent on the matter. Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer’s spokesman Matt House has not responded to any request for comment, and it is unclear if Schumer has made any public statements. His official Twitter account has no mention of this matter, nor does his campaign Twitter account. His U. S. Senate website does include a statement applauding the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for granting an emergency waiver to Jewish Community Centers to help track down the people responsible, a statement he released on Friday, but it does not include any reaction whatsoever to Thompson’s arrest. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s spokesman Drew Hammill has also not responded to questions about whether Pelosi has condemned Thompson for his alleged  . Her Twitter account shows no Tweets about it and there is nothing on her website. The same goes for Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) —  whose spokeswoman Lacey Rose has not responded to a Breitbart News request for comment. “We knew about this this morning and no Democrats have spoken out condemning this terrible human being. I find it shameful that there hasn’t been an outcry from the Democrats, many of whom have been accusing Trump of having inspired these   attacks,” Mort Klein, the president of the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) —  the oldest   group in the United States, founded back in 1897 —  told Breitbart News in a phone interview. He went on: Now we see it is a Trump hater who has perpetrated some of these acts showing at this point we have no evidence this was a Trump supporter —  it was quite the opposite. With the arrest of this person, we see that this is not someone who was inspired by Trump towards hatred, towards committing these   acts, it was actually someone who was antagonistic towards Trump inspired by President Trump’s adversaries. Just as the Democrats were demanding Trump respond to these attacks, which he has done in a very powerful and strong way, the Democrats should be condemning this supporter of the Democrats and hater of Trump. They should be responding of course, and condemning this man. I’ll tell you: It is painful to me to see the Democrats are silent at this point. The U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara, in announcing the charges against Thompson, confirmed the Twitter account in which he Tweeted nasty things about Trump and his support for Sanders was in fact Thompson’s account. Thompson was taken into custody by the FBI in St. Louis on Friday and is due to appear in court in Manhattan in New York City soon. “Today, we have charged Juan Thompson with allegedly stalking a former romantic interest by, among other things, making bomb threats in her name to Jewish Community Centers and to the   League,” Bharara said in his statement. Interestingly, all of this came after Sanders attempted to tarnish President Trump and White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon —  the former executive chairman of Breitbart News Network —  with this string of   activities. Just days ago, Sanders told J Street that Trump and Bannon needed to condemn   —  something they both have done very forcefully. “I hope very much that President Trump and his political adviser Mr. Bannon understand that the entire world is watching, that it is imperative that their voices be loud and clear in condemning ” Sanders said. Klein, of ZOA, told Breitbart News that Sanders’ silence proves he does not care about doing the right thing and stopping   as much as he does about scoring political points. Klein said of Sanders’ and other Democrats’ —  specifically Warren’s, Pelosi’s and Schumer’s —  silence: It makes it clear that all their criticism of Trump is simply political partisanship, not a genuine concern about attacks on Jewish institutions and Jewish cemeteries. It makes it clear at this point that this may well be political partisanship as opposed to genuine concern about Jewish people and  . What it shows is they care more about gaining political benefits than they do about condemning  . This indicates they have a greater concern for what benefits them politically than they do about their concerns about   and Jew hatred. That’s the message it sends to me. It happened this morning. They should have responded already. It happened this morning. That’s plenty of time. At this point, Klein said, it’s already too late for the Democrats to show they care, as they went after Bannon by falsely accusing him of being   with much more force than they have done about a   former reporter for The Intercept who was fired for printing fake news. In fact, their complete silence about Thompson proves everything is all political and not about stopping   he says. “I think the Democrats have now shown that they’re really embarrassed and horrified that this is a fellow Democrat who has enmity for Trump who committed these acts, as opposed to somebody who is supportive of Trump —  which is what so many of them were saying,” Klein said. “Why aren’t they going after this unquestionable   with the same type of viciousness they falsely accused of   Steve Bannon?”"
NBC ’Expert’ Blamed Orlando on Anti-Gay ’White Hate Groups’,"Early on Sunday before the world learned the identity and religion of the man who murdered up to 50 people in an Orlando, Florida, gay bar, a “law enforcement expert” for NBC went on the air on MSNBC and hinted that the shooter was probably a Christian and a member of a “white hate group. ”[Just before 7AM as the details about the shooting were beginning to roll out, NBC analyst Jim Cavanaugh appeared to tell the MSNBC audience that the man who shot up the bar was likely a   patron of the club and may have been banned by management for some reason. Cavanaugh said the shooting could have been a revenge shooting.  But Cavanaugh indulged in other speculation, insisting that there are “a lot” of white, Christian, domestic terrorist types who would carry out an attack on a gay bar because “they hate diverse people. ” “Is it just because it’s a diverse club and he hates diverse people?” Cavanaugh added. The “law enforcement expert” next ascribed the shooting to a “white hate group. ” “You know, there’s a lot of domestic terrorists we classify that do that, they are rooted in white hate movements. So it could be that,” Cavanaugh said. Expanding on his theory that the shooter was someone who was a former patron who was kicked out of the club, Cavanaugh noted that not all mass shootings are terrorism. I don’t think that all violent mass murderers terrorize because all violent mass murderers do terrorize. When you have a shooting in a nightclub, you know, a lot of times it’s someone kicked out, thrown out of the nightclub, barred from the nightclub. They want to get back at the nightclub and its patrons because they have done wrong. And you have a lot of times revenge motives when you have nightclub shootings. And some of those can be very bad, multiple victims. But that doesn’t seem to ring true here, if you have somebody coming in with a bomb and a rifle and gun. It’s not like they were just thrown out, they went to the car and came back. It’s more like they planned to do this, and they wanted a high casualty count. Cavanaugh was clearly attempting to dissuade MSNBC viewers from assuming Islamic terror was a motivation of the Orlando shooter. Granted Cavanaugh was speaking very early on the morning of the attack, but as the hours passed and more evidence emerged, the shooter was identified as Omar Mir Seddique Mateen, a registered Democrat and Muslim from Port St. Lucie, Florida. Still, NBC’s Jim Cavanaugh seems to have a history of these sort of wild speculations always leaning away from blaming Islam. As Real Clear Politics notes, at least two times in the past Cavanaugh has urged people to absolve Islam from acts of terrorism. In 2015 Cavanaugh insisted that President Obama should issue a directive to force people to stop identifying terror attacks to ISIS. And in 2014 he insisted that people in cafes shouldn’t worry because “Islam is not calling to kill people. ” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com"
Death Toll in Oakland Warehouse Fire Rises to 36 as Search Continues - The New York Times,"OAKLAND, Calif.  —   Carmen Brito was asleep on Friday night when she suddenly woke up gasping for breath. Outside her small studio, one floor down from where a raging concert was taking place, she saw her neighbor’s wall on fire. “I’m pretty sure I was the first person to see the fire, and when I saw it, it was bigger than I was,” said Ms. Brito, 28. The inferno killed at least 36 people and is regarded as one of the worst structure fires in the United States in over a decade. On Sunday, firefighters were digging through the ruins of the warehouse, where people had gathered for an electronic dance show on Friday when flames ripped through the building, collapsing the floors. The search of the building, which had only two exits, could continue for days, officials said at a news conference, warning that the death toll could climb considerably higher. The authorities said on Monday that 11 victims have been positively identified. One victim was the son of a local law enforcement officer, said Sgt. Ray Kelly of the Alameda County sheriff’s office. “This tragedy has hit very close to home for our agency,” he said. Other victims were from countries in Europe and Asia. The officials were in the process of contacting agencies abroad. Ms. Brito was just one member of a community of roughly 25 artists who inhabited the building illegally  —   but in plain sight of Oakland city officials. The building, which was known as the Ghost Ship and has been under investigation for code violations, had a permit to function as a warehouse, but not as a residence or for a party. A criminal investigation began on Sunday. Ms. Brito said the fire started at the very back of the building, in a studio next to hers, when the couple who occupied the room were gone. She said a firefighter investigating the blaze had asked her whether the couple had recently installed a refrigerator, which they had, raising the possibility that the building’s electrical system played a role. The officials said on Monday that they believed they had identified the section of the building where the fire started, but cautioned that they were no closer to finding a cause. Ms. Brito and another survivor, Nikki Kelber, 44, said the building’s renters had repeatedly asked its owner to upgrade the electrical system, which failed often enough that residents had flashlights in their studios. Ms. Kelber and Ms. Brito said that the building had many fire extinguishers and that one of the residents, Max Ohr, tried to use one on the flames but soon gave up. “It was like trying to put out a bonfire with a squirt gun,” Ms. Brito said. The residents of the building said they had been priced out of parts of the San Francisco Bay Area that have become increasingly unaffordable. They called themselves refugees and were happy to be living among a community of   artists paying an affordable rent. Oakland itself has seen rents and home prices skyrocket with the technology boom. The high cost of living has led to alternative housing arrangements across the region, from a community of homes made of shipping containers to lines of recreational vehicles on Silicon Valley side streets. But these spaces, while often illegal, are subject to the same market forces rippling through the broader market. That has given outsize power to the   master tenants who control the lease of a building and, at least in some cases, can make money by subletting to struggling artists willing to live in substandard conditions. The Ghost Ship was one of these illegal living spaces. Residents and visitors described it as both a haven for artists and a fire trap, with a warren of trailers, broken pianos and stacks of wood and a complex network of electrical cords and generators. It was home for jewelers, metalworkers, dancers, musicians and others, and parties that brought hundreds to its labyrinthine corridors. But it was also plagued by discord and the whims of its two master tenants, Derick Ion Almena and Micah Allison, who lived there with their three children, ages 13, 7 and 6. Several residents said they were lured in by the promise of cheap rent and a creative community, only to find that their new home had no heat, sporadic electricity and a master tenant  —   Mr. Almena  —   who would bring in homeless people to harass residents who crossed him. Mr. Almena was serving a sentence of three years’ probation, having pleaded no contest in January to a felony charge of receiving stolen property. Mr. Almena and Ms. Allison could not be reached for comment on Sunday. “A lot of people were his friend because they believed in the miracle,” said Shelley Mack, 58, who moved into the space in October 2014, paying $700 to live in a mobile home inside the warehouse. “But it was a sick place. ” Ms. Mack left after several frightening episodes, she said. In one, she said, a friend of Mr. Almena’s pulled a gun on several residents. In March 2015, the Alameda County Social Services Agency removed Mr. Almena and Ms. Allison’s children from their custody after relatives expressed concerns about safety. The agency returned the children this past June. People familiar with the space questioned why the police did not do anything to shut down the Ghost Ship. “That place was a tinderbox,” said Danielle Boudreaux, 40, who had visited the warehouse. “Anybody who went in there who had any kind of authority should have not allowed it to continue. ” Mr. Ohr, who took on a supervisory role among tenants, said they told the landlord that the electrical system needed upgrading. “We reached out on multiple occasions, complaining that the power wasn’t working,” Mr. Ohr said. “They made no attempt to make it right. ” The area where the fire had started had been closed off to the partygoers and was “unmonitored,” Mr. Ohr said. “There are plenty of signs that point to it being an electrical fire. ” Ms. Kelber’s studio was near one of the building’s exits, and when she spotted a “ball of fire” coming down the hallway she had only seconds to react. “After 15 seconds, the power went out, and another 30 seconds later it was completely engulfed. It went so fast. ” Ms. Kelber and Ms. Brito described confusion in the seconds after the fire was discovered because the urgent and panicked cries of residents were drowned out by a D. J.’s music in the building’s mezzanine, where the concert was underway. The wooden statues, exposed beams and countless other objects made of timber on the ground floor of the building helped fuel a fire that raged for hours and gutted the entire structure. One of the residents escaped barefoot in his pajamas carrying his two dogs. Another resident appeared to have injured himself in a fall while trying to escape, Ms. Brito said. A fellow resident, Bob Mule, heard his cries but was unable to pull him from the fire. “Bob tried pulling him out but had to leave him behind because Bob was starting to get burning things falling on him,” Ms. Brito said. After they escaped, Ms. Brito and the other survivors stood outside the building, helplessly watching it burn. “It was something out of a horror film, with cloud after cloud of black smoke,” Ms. Brito said. “Occasionally a body would come hurtling through the door toward the street. ” Ms. Brito said residents were aware that they were living in the warehouse without permits and recognized the risks involved. “I get why people could look at us and think that we were responsible,” she said. “But we were doing our best with what we had. ”"
Poll: Comey’s firing gets low approval Trump’s support unmoved,"Washington (CNN) Reaction to President Donald Trump’s decision to fire FBI Director James Comey tilts negative, an   Street Journal poll released Sunday has found.   percent of respondents said they approve of Trump’s decision, compared to 38% who disapprove and 32% who said they did not have enough information to provide an answer. Those numbers change with party affiliation, however.   percent of Republicans said they approve of Comey’s dismissal, with 8% signaling disapproval and 33% with no opinion. Despite the low overall level of support for the move, Trump’s approval rating was essentially unchanged from the last   poll. The new poll found 39% approve of Trump’s performance as President, while 54% disapprove and 7% are unsure. A   poll pegged Trump’s rating at 40% approval, 54% disapproval and 6% unsure. The poll of 800 adults was taken from May 11 to 13, with a margin of error of ±3. 46 percentage points. A Gallup poll taken from May 10 to 11 found slightly higher approval of Trump’s decision to fire Comey with fewer people undecided, with 39% approving, 46% disapproving and 15% having no opinion. The   poll also touched on Republican efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. The House earlier this month passed the American Health Care Act, which Trump has said he supports.  The poll found 23% believe the bill is a ”good idea,” 48% say it is a ”bad idea” and 28% have no opinion. A Quinnipiac University poll released May 11 found 21% of respondents said they approve of the bill, while 56% disapprove."
Three Dead After Shots Ring Out at House Party North of Seattle,"Three persons were killed and a fourth was wounded after a man with a gun walked into a party at a residence north of Seattle and opened fire. [The incident occurred early Saturday in the town of Mukilteo.  According to   about   people were at the house when the attack took place. One witness —     Alexis Gemmer —  told her grandmother she “was hanging out with friends from Kamiak High School at a home in Mukilteo early Saturday when a young man showed up with a rifle. ” The grandmother said her granddaughter “hid in a closet, from where she called and texted” that she was okay. The gunman and one of the victims are alleged to have “recently broken up. ” The Star reports that the gunman “[killed] two people at a fire pit”‘ then went to the roof and shot at other individuals from there. “Washington State Patrol Trooper Will Finn said the male suspect was pulled over at around 2 a. m. heading south on Interstate 5 near Chehalis, about 113 miles away” from the site of the attack. He was taken into custody. Washington state instituted universal background checks in 2014 to prevent high profile shootings.

Man arrested in connection to Ferguson police shootings," (CNN) A    man from the St. Louis area has been arrested in connection with the shooting of two police officers during last week’s protests in Ferguson, Missouri, a prosecutor said Sunday. Jeffrey Williams was arrested late Saturday, and he has been charged with two counts of   assault, a count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal activity, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch said at a news conference in Clayton.  ”The demonstrations were pretty much over (when the officers were shot). People were leaving, and that’s when this happened,” he said, describing Williams as a demonstrator who had taken part in protests on numerous occasions.  At the time of his arrest, Williams was on probation for receiving stolen property, and McCulloch said he believed Williams had an outstanding warrant after not reporting to his probation officer for several months.  The prosecutor repeatedly thanked the public for the information that led to the arrest. He also said that, because of the public’s assistance in the case, police were able to serve a search warrant on Williams’ residence where they seized a .  handgun, ”which has been tied to the shell casings that were recovered” at the scene of the shooting.  Williams is being held on a   $300, 000 bond, McCulloch said, adding that it’s possible Williams could face more charges and that others could be charged in the case. Big question: Intent, One element of the case that authorities have yet to sort out is intent, McCulloch said, adding that Williams has acknowledged firing the shots but has said he wasn’t aiming at the police officers.  Investigators are not sure they ”buy” Williams’ claim that he opened fire after a dispute with other individuals, McCulloch said, but he didn’t rule it out.  ”It’s possible he was firing at someone else,” he said, urging any other witnesses with information to come forward.  Bishop Derrick Robinson, an area organizer, challenged the idea that Williams was a   protester. ”I asked him (Williams) why would he say that he was a protester because it makes us look bad    because so many things that we’ve done to rebuild our community. It sets us like five steps back to say that it was a protester who did it, but he admitted to me that he’d never protested,” said Robinson, who spoke to Williams on Sunday. Robinson added: ”We won’t allow this to distract us from our mission, and from purpose, because we will continue to fight.” ’We could have buried two officers’ The shootings occurred Wednesday night. The shots rang out from a hill overlooking the city’s police station shortly after midnight Wednesday, at the end of a protest against the Ferguson Police Department, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at the time. Officers saw ”muzzle flashes . .. about 125 yards away,” Belmar said. ”We could have buried two police officers,” Belmar told reporters last week. ”I feel very confident that whoever did this . .. came there for whatever nefarious reason that it was.” Public donations poured in to be used toward a reward to find the gunman and any accomplices, Belmar said. Authorities offered a $10, 000 reward for information leading to the arrest of person or persons responsible for the gunfire upon the two officers, according to the St. Louis Regional CrimeStoppers website. McCulloch said the tipster whose information led to Williams’ arrest is eligible to receive the reward. He declined to provide any information on the tipster or the nature of the tip.  Protesters said they had nothing to do with the shooting, saying the demonstrators believe in nonviolence. ”As the protest was dying down, someone, somewhere got violent. Now who they were and what group they were affiliated with, we don’t know,” said Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman. ”In no way are they representative of the thousands of people . .. who have been protesting.” Belmar believes someone targeted the police, who have faced heated criticism for months, he said.   ”These police officers were standing there, and they were shot just because they were police officers,” he said. The department has been under fire since one of its officers, Darren Wilson, shot and killed   teen Michael Brown in August, and more recently since a scathing U. S. Department of Justice report documented a pattern of racial discrimination. Police Chief Thomas Jackson resigned Wednesday. ”We are actively addressing the issues that have raised concerns of fairness and fair treatment. We support peaceful protesting. However, we will not allow, nor tolerate, the destructive and violent actions of a few to disrupt our unifying efforts,” the mayor of Ferguson and the City Council said in a statement Sunday. While the demonstrators’ focus was Ferguson, neither of the wounded officers works for that police department. One is from Webster Groves, a St. Louis suburb 13 miles south of Ferguson. The officer    a    with seven years’ experience    was shot at the high point of his cheek, just under his right eye, Belmar said.  The other was hit in the shoulder and the bullet came out the middle of his back, Belmar said. He is a    officer with the St. Louis County Police Department, who has been in law enforcement for 14 years. Both men were treated and released."
Pregnant Women Defy Zika at Brazil Carnival,"The Brazilian government made efforts to warn revelers before the annual Carnival celebrations to protect themselves from the Zika virus by wearing   clothing and avoiding kissing and sexual contact, particularly pregnant women. [A number of pregnant women disregarded the alerts, however, taking their chances with the Zika pandemic to enjoy what Carnival has to offer.  The Carnival celebrations, which precede the Catholic Lenten period every year, tend to be a flurry of dancing, flamboyant but revealing outfits, and a contest “where kissing as many people as possible is a top pastime,” as the Associated Press noted. Brazil’s health authorities attempted to quell this risky behavior with a number of suggestions, including avoiding kissing strangers and the sweaty crowds of Carnival in general. The Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, a wing of Brazil’s Ministry of Health, suggested pregnant women avoid Carnival entirely, and added that the partners of pregnant women have “an additional responsibility” not to go to Carnival and engage in risky behavior that may result in their partner contracting the virus. While dozens of Brazilian cities were forced to cancel Carnival celebrations, some using the funds, instead, for Zika prevention and research, the nation’s largest parties went on. The Zika fear was present in a number of outfits, as revelers disguised themselves as the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries the disease, pretending to sting people. While the Aedes aegypti bite is the most common way humans contract Zika, at least one case of sexual transmission has been confirmed and multiple cases of contamination through blood transfusions. Traces of Zika have been found in human saliva and urine, leading officials to warn against kissing strangers. The full scope of the danger of contracting the Zika virus remains unknown. Eighty percent of patients who test positive for Zika have no symptoms, and most adults experience only mild symptoms if they notice their infection at all. Pregnant women, however, face a much more dire threat: the potential that their child will be born with microcephaly, a condition in which a child is born with a skull too small for its brain, causing severe neurological damage. Brazil celebrated Carnival with its usual bombast despite the Zika outbreak  —   now a “pandemic”  —   leading many pregnant women to disregard the advice. “I’m not worried. First they say one thing, then they say another. Who knows what’s really happening anyway?” Julia Silva, wearing a halter top that exposed her pregnant belly, told PBS while attending the festivities in Recife. She admitted to not wearing insect repellent. Another pregnant woman, Flavia Nicacio, told PBS she could not resist attending Carnival, but at least “I’m wearing all these clothes,” she stated, noting her seasonally inappropriate pants and long shawl. At least one pregnant woman PBS found at Carnival refused to identify herself because, she said, “I’m a doctor and   …     I am setting a terrible example. ” Many of the pregnant women who stayed home told PBS they did so mostly because their pregnancy made them unable to spend too many hours partying without feeling uncomfortable. “I’m seven months pregnant, and I’m tired,” Camila Clarissa Chagas told the outlet. Chinese state outlet Xinhua found not only pregnant women at Carnival, but an event dedicated to young mothers called “Bloco Umbilical Cord” —  “bloco” being the traditional name for the independent block parties that are divided throughout the city. “It is impossible to stay home with a small girl during Carnival,” Gabriela Ortis, eight months pregnant with a second child, told Xinhua. As Carnival is celebrated worldwide, at least one outlet encouraged pregnant women to attend. The   “Embarazo10” published a listicle of creative Carnival disguises for pregnant women, many requiring the woman to bare her belly. “Make everyone take a look at your belly without it having to be because you are pregnant,” the listicle reads. The outfit ideas include “beer belly” and “fried egg”: "
’F*ck Israel’ Graffiti Discovered at UK Campus After Ambassador’s Visit - Breitbart,"The Jerusalem Post reports:   graffiti defacing the campus of a British university with vulgar slogans was being removed after the Jewish state’s new ambassador to the United Kingdom paid a visit to the London campus earlier this week, The Jewish Chronicle reported Thursday. Ambassador Mark Regev on Wednesday toured England’s School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) having been invited by the university’s director, Baroness Valarie Amos. Shortly after his departure, however,   graffiti was discovered scattered about the school’s campus including “F**k  Regev, Amos and Israel. BDS or else. ” A day after Regev visited the SOAS campus, protests erupted by   activists demanding an apology from the university director."
Democrat Megadonor Tom Steyer Considers Running for Governor - Breitbart,"  billionaire and Democrat   Tom Steyer is reportedly considering joining the crowded Democratic field of candidates for the 2018 governor’s race in California. [“It’s no secret that Tom Steyer is considering running for office, and he’ll make a decision later this year,” Rose Kapolczynski, a top Steyer advisor, told The Hill. “We aren’t going to discuss our research program in the news media. ”  Kapolczynski reportedly ran all four of former Sen. Barbara Boxer‘s ( ) successful Senate campaigns. Steyer, who threw his support behind Hillary Clinton for president, is also reportedly fielding a survey that tests his strengths and weaknesses against presumed   Lieutenant Gov. Gavin Newsom. In addition to Newsom, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and state Treasurer John Chiang have officially entered the race. Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León (  Angeles) is also considering throwing his hat into the race. De León will reportedly term out of the state Senate in 2018. Steyer reportedly spent $87 million on the 2016 elections, and will likely spend big on his gubernatorial bid, should he enter the race. In January, Steyer said, “the world did not play out on November 8 the way I expected it to” with President Donald Trump’s victory, which dealt a devastating blow to the Democrats. At the time, he signaled backing away from the idea of running for higher office and suggested he would instead stay involved by working on climate change policy through his NextGen Climate Action group. However, new reports indicate Steyer may have had a change of heart. Depending on the field survey’s results, he could soon become the fourth Democrat candidate for the governor’s race. This weekend, the California Democratic Convention will take reportedly place in Sacramento, where all major announced and potential candidates will address over 3, 300 delegates from across the Golden State. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is also scheduled to speak at this weekend’s convention. On Thursday, he reportedly sidestepped questions about a possible run for governor, but didn’t dismiss the idea. “I have a truly amazing job that I love,” Garcetti said at the California Newspaper Publishers Association meeting in Santa Monica on Thursday, according to the Los Angeles Times. He added that he’s not going to “close anything off. ” Republican John Cox has also declared his candidacy. Follow Adelle Nazarian on Facebook and Twitter."
Donald Trump Deletes Tweet Showing Hillary Clinton and Star of David Shape - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, came under fire on Saturday for posting on Twitter an image of the Star of David shape next to a picture of Hillary Clinton and calling his opponent the “most corrupt candidate ever!” While the   star is used in other contexts, including as a symbol of many Sheriff’s Departments, it has deep meaning in Judaism and the image was overlaid atop a pile of money. It appeared to play into the stereotype of Jews being obsessed with finances. After being derided on social media, Mr. Trump deleted the post and replaced it with one that had a circle instead of the star shape. While Mr. Trump has been working to professionalize his campaign, the Twitter post was the latest example of him making remarks many deem offensive. Several weeks ago, he insinuated that a federal judge presiding over a lawsuit against Trump University could not be impartial in the case because of his Mexican heritage. Mr. Trump apparently realized the problem with the original Twitter post because he rarely apologizes for his remarks or deletes his posts. His campaign did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday. Before the post came down, Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, asked on his personal Twitter account, “Why is there a Star of David?” Other commenters were more blunt: Mr. Trump regularly touts his close ties to Jewish people, noting that his daughter Ivanka converted to Judaism when she married her husband, Jared Kushner. He also has promised to make the security of Israel a top priority if he is elected president. However, Mr. Trump has frustrated some Jews for initially declining to take a firm stand on the side of Israel when discussing the conflict with the Palestinians. And he angered some last year when he joked about Jews being good with money during a speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition. Mr. Trump has also been criticized for failing to denounce supporters who have harangued Jewish journalists on social media and at gatherings of white nationalists, and for being slow to disavow the support of David Duke, the former Klansman."
Students Boycott High School’s Required ’Racial Identity’ Day,"At least one thousand students skipped New Trier High School’s mandatory day of “racial identity” classes on Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. [The suburban Chicago high school, which ranks among the top public high schools in the country, held class on the public holiday, and scheduled seminars on “systemic racism” that sought to increase students’ awareness “of their own racial identities and the identities of others. ”  But students stayed away in droves. One parent, whose daughter is biracial, told Breitbart News that her daughter had deliberately avoided the program for fear of being singled out and forced to define herself by her skin color. “She called me from school, about a     ago, and asked, ‘Mom, do I have to go? I’m black, and I’ll be a target. ” Though she generally disapproved of missing school, she allowed her daughter to skip the day. “I felt bad for her  …    I’ve never felt race has been a factor in our lives,” she said. “It’s one thing to study Dr. King’s ‘I Have a Dream’ speech,” she added. “But to talk about feeling guilty because you are white?  …    These kids today are so far beyond it. It’s like they don’t see color. ” The district’s program, she said,  is “going backwards. ” The New Trier program approached race from an exclusively   perspective, in violation of district policy. Seminars included: “The Truth about Ferguson: The Investigation into the Death of Michael Brown,” “Why Do I Have to Feel Guilty for Being White?” and “Western Bias in Science. ” One poster hung inside the school (above) quoted author Toni Morrison: “In this country American means white. Everybody else has to hyphenate. ” At a school board meeting Monday, district officials spun the day as a success, though they admitted that attendance had only been “between 66% and 70%” of the student body of 4, 200. Breitbart News learned that students were later told the day would not count as a full day for attendance purposes, since participation had been “like 50%. ” One parent at the meeting, who described herself as Hispanic, said she became alarmed when her daughter brought home a list of seminars. “When she showed me the list of classes, I was not only baffled, but also concerned,” she said, citing seminars with names such as “To Pimp a Butterfly,” and content including a “Pyramid of Hate” on   prejudice. “Out of all these options, I could discern no diversity of options,” she added. The point, she said, seemed to be “to instill more angst than need be” in children. She took her daughter to a community service project instead. Assistant Superintendent Tim Hayes defended the program as a way to make the public holiday “significant and meaningful,” and said the focus of the day had been to “champion” Dr. King’s legacy. Vice President Greg Robitaille said there had been an equal number of “provocative” and “ ” classs titles, and said his own children had come home from the school day “slightly more aware,” but not “brainwashed” or “radicalized. ” “The big shame, in my opinion, is we probably lost half the kids, [who] didn’t show up today,” Robitaille said. Other board members praised the “wonderful day,” arguing that it had not imposed “  lessons. ” They lamented that many students had missed the keynote speech by author Isabel Wilkerson because of technical problems. Two staff members and two students also defended the program. One, Spiro Bolos, discussed the seminar he had given, “TV Tokenism,” which criticized portrayals of minorities in media. Another, Michael Christensen, talked about her seminar, “Drawing Lines: Housing Segregation and Redlining in Chicagoland Neighborhoods. ” The class apparently did not consider a variety of political views, though housing is a current topic of local political debate. Two students, who had also led sessions during the day, also addressed the meeting. One, who taught a seminar called “What Is Your Privilege?” described how students tossed pieces of paper into a recycling bin from their seats, with students in the back of the classroom experiencing disadvantage. Another, who led a session called “How Do We Talk About Race,” complained to the board that only four students had attended her session. The New Trier Township High School District did not return requests for comment."
Latest WikiLeaks Vault 7 Release Claims CIA Can Attribute Cyber Attacks to Other Countries - Breitbart,"WikiLeaks’ latest release from the Vault 7 leaks, titled “Marble,” claims that the CIA can use string obfuscating algorithms to attribute cyber attacks to other countries. [WikiLeaks released the “Marble Framework” leak today on their website, describing Marble as a tool used to “hamper forensic investigators and   companies from attributing viruses, trojans and hacking attacks to the CIA. ”  “Marble does this by hiding (‘obfuscating’) text fragments used in CIA malware from visual inspection,” WikiLeaks claims. “This is the digital equivalent of a specialized CIA tool to place covers over the english language text on U. S. produced weapons systems before giving them to insurgents secretly backed by the CIA. ” Marble is reportedly an obfuscation tool that is not used as a cyber attack itself but to hide and cover up previous attacks. WikiLeaks claims it is part of the CIA’s   approach and the CIA’s core library of cyber attacks and viruses, “Designed to allow for flexible and    obfuscation” as “string obfuscation algorithms (especially those that are unique) are often used to link malware to a specific developer or development shop. ” The source code also reportedly contains a deobfuscator used to reverse CIA text obfuscation. WikiLeaks believes that with the framework now made public, forensic investigators should be able to notice patterns and signatures which can be followed to attribute previous cyber attacks and viruses to the CIA. WikiLeaks also believes that Marble could be used to attribute cyber attacks to multiple countries due to evidence of Marble test examples in English, Chinese, Russian, Korean, Arabic, and Farsi. WikiLeaks states, “This would permit a forensic attribution double game, for example by pretending that the spoken language of the malware creator was not American English, but Chinese, but then showing attempts to conceal the use of Chinese, drawing forensic investigators even more strongly to the wrong conclusion,  —   but there are other possibilities, such as hiding fake error messages. ” Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

Palestinian Terror Chief Calls For Iran To Join ’All-Out War’ Against Israel,"TEL AVIV  —   The leader of a Palestinian terrorist group in Lebanon called for an “  war” with Israel and Jordan in which Iranian soldiers would fight to “liberate Palestine. ”  [“I want to see the revolutionary fighters from [Iran] in the Galilee,” Ahmad Jibril, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of   Command, told Hezbollah’s   TV in an interview translated by watchdog group the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) on Friday.  Jibril said “an axis of resistance” should be formed against Israel that would include Syria, Iraq, Iran and Hezbollah. The aim of the resistance would be to fight for “the liberation of Palestine from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River. ” After defeating Israel, he said, “we will enter Jordan, whether King Abdullah likes it or not. ” He added that “The war with this enemy will be an   war   …     in the Golan, in South Lebanon, in the Galilee   …     [and] will be waged from Rosh Hanikra to Aqaba. ” “Hezbollah is getting ready for it, and so are we,” he added. Jibril’s remarks come in the wake of threats made by Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, including, most recently, vowing that in a future war Hezbollah would not hold back from targeting Israel’s vital infrastructure. “In the face of Israel’s threats to destroy Lebanon’s infrastructure, we will not abide by red lines, especially regarding Haifa’s ammonia and the nuclear reactor in Dimona. Hezbollah possesses the full courage for this,” he said, according to an English translation of his comments reported by the Naharnet website. Last week, Nasrallah made similar threats against Haifa and Dimona, warning that a strike on the ammonia plant would be akin to a nuclear bomb explosion. During an official visit to Beirut, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Thursday said that Palestinian factions were committed to preserving security in refugee camps around Lebanon."
Fear The Bern: Big Winner In Iowa Was Karl Marx - Breitbart,"The big winner last night on the Democrat side of the Iowa caucuses was Karl Marx and the ideology of socialism. [Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders effectively tied establishment Democrat Hillary Clinton, scoring 695 delegates compared to Clinton’s 700.  While Republicans are breaking down what went right and what went wrong with the campaigns of Ted Cruz, Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, the real focus should be on how frumpy,   Bernie Sanders got as many votes as the establishment Democrat, simply by preaching outright socialism. The danger goes beyond partisanship. Republicans, independents, moderate Democrats and anyone who cares about the future of our country needs to wake up to the significance of what happened in Iowa. When Hillary Clinton got trounced by Barack Obama in the 2008 primaries, she could, at least, chalk it up to the fact that Senator Obama represented something young and different. Not so Monday night in Iowa. The support for Bernie Sanders is based on his socialist ideology, not his sparkling personality or good looks. Cranky, white and old, Bernie Sanders calls himself a socialist and tied Hillary Clinton and her     political machine by preaching explicitly socialist policies. Sander’s success wasn’t a case of “New York values” or West Coast kooks. Sanders scored big in Iowa, the heartland of America. The only reason that Hillary Clinton didn’t out and out lose is that Iowa skews older, and that she won six coin tosses. As Jessica Taylor wrote: The Vermont senator just couldn’t match the strength of the youth vote that Obama marshaled in 2008. Just 18 percent of the vote came from   to     —   down from a 22 percent share eight years ago. Among those, Sanders dominated, winning 84 percent to Clinton’s 14 percent. The good news for Clinton was that 60 percent of   were over the age of 45  —   and she carried them easily. Among voters 65 and older, Clinton had a more than    advantage.   The New Left has spent the past 50 years entrenching themselves in academia and culture. Their plans for a glorious plenty revolution in the 1960s didn’t work out, but radicals like the Weather Underground‘s Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn moved above ground and into the ivory tower. America has had two generations of this academic approach to promoting socialism via multiculturalism and political correctness. This is why the Black Lives Matter inspired student revolts that happened this past autumn at college campuses around the country were spurned on by tenured professors and administrators. The universities have also had two generations of teaching the media makers, including journalism school graduates with a soft spot in their heart for socialism. All of this set the table for Bernie Sanders. All Bernie had to do was explicitly call for the   state that college professors, the mainstream media and Che Guevara   wearing hipsters have been praying for. Meanwhile, Republicans have formed a circular firing squad that focused on sideshow issues like Canadian dual citizenship or fake outrage at supposedly sexism, ignoring the real threat: A   socialist United States in the next four years is looming. Not just the heavily   based mixed economy that’s been stumbling its way to the left for decades, but a proudly     people’s state with a suicidal foreign policy to go along with it. There’s apparently no public relations downside to calling yourself a socialist. Have no doubt: Bernie Sanders’s success is not going unnoticed by the younger generation of hipper, much more charismatic socialists like Van Jones. Jones has had to downplay his socialist background for years trying to play the establishment insider role but looking at the numbers that Bernie is racking up is probably going to make him think twice. It’s time for every Republican candidate to start focusing on the real issue, and start explaining to Americans why the tyranny of socialism and sharia are bad. That’s what it’s come down to: this needs to be explained to counteract the propaganda.

"Target’s Transgender Bathroom Disaster Is Huge Opportunity For Rivals, Say Brand Experts - Breitbart","Target’s unpopular decision to force its customer base of mothers and children into   bathrooms and changing rooms is creating an economic opportunity for other firms  —   but none have announced plans to exploit the company’s   mistake. [“Target could lose millions of customers if other retail chains take advantage of the boycott,” says Chris Stone, a former   who now runs Faith Based Consumer, which grades companies on their respect for Christian consumers. Indeed, Walmart just reported an unexpected uptick and experienced a rise in stock prices.  “If ten million people switched from Target to another company just once, they could cost the company $600 million in revenues, assuming an average purchase of $60,” he said. “That lost revenue will have an even greater impact on company profits and stock prices. ” “If Walmart comes out and proactively states they welcome these disenfranchised consumers [and] they’ll provide proof of performance, there will be a migration of consumers from Target to Walmart,” Stone told Breitbart. In fact, any company which “reaches out to that consumer, and says ‘You’re welcome here,” can benefit, Stone said. Target’s managers, he added, “have taken a position that is so polarizing, it will be very easy for the consumer to pick and choose among the competitors who they like better. ” Though it is hard to know if Target’s loss was Walmart’s gain, late last week the nation’s largest retailer reported a    quarterly profit. The announcement drove up stock prices even its competitors have been on the downturn. “It looks like the     customers have cut back, but the   customer is spending,” analyst Brian Yarbrough told Reuters last Thursday. Walmart stock shares were up 9. 3 percent at $69. 05 on Thursday morning’s trading. Only a few small or upmarket chains have quietly announced their own   bathroom policies, including Barnes  Noble booksellers, Hudson’s Bay Co. department stores (owner of Lord  Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue) and the liberal Starbucks coffee company. Starbucks spokeswoman Jaime Riley said the coffee chain is “looking into additional opportunities to have more   signage in our restrooms where jurisdictions allow it,” USA Today reported. But Starbucks doesn’t have dressing rooms in their small    outlets. But USA Today was unable to find any other retailer willing to confirm a policy for or against   bathrooms. Breitbart asked retailers such as Walmart, Sears, and   if they had any specific transgender bathroom policies. None replied to the queries left with their public relations departments. Of course, many corporations have LGBT polices, such as those Target celebrates. Hormel foods, a meat processor, has celebrated itself for its LGBT policies, crowning itself the “best place to work for LGBT equality. ” Fitness gym operator Planet Fitness has also in the past announced its own   policies by insisting that men can use the women’s locker rooms. The company has already acted on its policy, as well. As The Federalist notes, in 2015 the fitness giant actually revoked the membership of a woman who complained about a man who insisted on using the women’s locker room. But, with so few others standing up with Target, it appears that most American retailers are hoping the whole discussion just fades away so that they don’t have to take a public stance. Target Corp’s stock price has fallen from $83. 98 on the day the new policy was announced, to $75. 70 on May 12. That’s a loss of roughly $4. 5 billion in stock value. Target’s CEO Brian Cornell is trying to reduce the damage. On May 11, for example, he promised that every store would have a family restroom. We’re committed over the next few months, to make sure every one of our stores has that option, because we want to make sure that our guests be welcomed in our stores. But if there’s a question of safety, I can tell you and others, our focus on safety is unwavering, and we want to make sure we provide a welcoming environment for all our guests, one that’s safe, one that’s comfortable. But he declined to reverse his decision to impose   changing rooms on   families, and he continued to reassure progressives and Wall Street experts that Target’s     policy is a good idea. Target has done itself a lot of harm in the highly competitive retail sector, Stone insisted. More than one million people have signed the American Family Association petition against the   bathroom and   policy  —   and another 10 million Americans may know about and disagree with the company policy. “What is really going to be important is to see if [another retail] brand comes out and openly welcomes all these disenchanted Target customers. Someone is going to have to say ‘We welcome you. If you’re not happy at Target, come over and because we welcome you here,’” Stone averred. “If someone does that, they will be able to secure those customers” the activist added. Companies need to do what they can to bolster their revenues, Stone concluded, because the retail sector is already very competitive and is losing customers to the online shopping. For example, the Sports Authority chain is failing. Just in California, Walmart, Macy’s, Sears, Kmart, JCPenney, and The Gap are closing stories in 2016, according to a retail industry website.

6 takeaways from Trump’s Times meeting," (CNN)  Donald Trump brushed aside his campaign promises to jail Hillary Clinton, batted away questions about conflicts of interest over his business empire and denounced the   movement that is celebrating his victory.  Answering questions for just the second time since his election, Trump met for 75 minutes on Tuesday with reporters, editors and columnists from The New York Times.  It wasn’t broadcast live, but some Times reporters tweeted Trump’s remarks in real time. And, since Trump has not held a news conference since his upset win two weeks ago, the entire political world was glued to Twitter through it all.  Here are six takeaways from Trump’s meeting with the Times:  The grudges Trump is still holding, The   was downright magnanimous toward his longtime Democratic foes.  About his campaign promise to jail Hillary Clinton, Trump said he doesn’t want to ”hurt the Clintons” and that doing so would be ”very, very divisive for the country.”   He heaped praise on President Barack Obama, saying he appreciated Obama’s handling of the transition of power and liked him personally. ”I didn’t know if I’d like him. I probably thought that maybe I wouldn’t, but I did. I really enjoyed him a lot,” Trump said.  And of New York’s Chuck Schumer, the new Senate Democratic leader: ”I’ve liked Chuck Schumer for a long time.” So it’s not the opposition that still gets under Trump’s skin.  It’s his fellow Republicans    particularly those who ran away from him in the general election. Trump bragged that he ”helped numerous senators” win, and took a shot New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican who narrowly lost after distancing herself from Trump. ”No, thank you,” he said he told Ayotte about a post in Trump’s Cabinet.  He also mocked Nevada Rep. Joe Heck, a Republican who lost his Senate race after similarly staying far away from Trump. Heck, he said, fell ”like a lead balloon.” Trump was also cautious about the Republican congressional leaders    House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.  ”Right now they’re in love with me,” Trump said. ”Four weeks ago, they weren’t in love with me.”  A Nixonian    view, Trump brushed aside questions about how his actions in the White House could benefit his businesses with a startling declaration.  ”The law’s totally on my side. The president can’t have a conflict of interest,” Trump said.  It was reminiscent of Richard Nixon’s comment to journalist David Frost that by definition, a president’s actions don’t violate the law. ”Well, when the president does it, that means it is not illegal,” Nixon said.  Trump acknowledged his businesses will benefit from his victory, saying his new hotel in Washington is ”probably a more valuable asset than it was before” and that its brand is ”hotter.”  But he said he’s no longer interested in his businesses and will be passing them on to his children.  ”I don’t care about having anything to do” with anything outside the United States’ best interests, he said. ”I don’t want to influence anything.” A new view on climate change? On the campaign trail, Trump had pledged to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accords    a move that would upend global efforts to address global warming.  Tuesday, he wasn’t as specific. ”I’m looking at it very closely. I have an open mind to it,” he said.  It was part of a broader change for the   on the topic of climate science. He had previously rejected scientists’ conclusion that humans have played a role in the earth’s warming. But on Tuesday, Trump said that ”I think there is some connectivity” between humans and climate change, although he declined to elaborate. Trump’s white supremacist disavowal, Days after the white supremacist movement, known as the ”” gathered in Washington to celebrate Trump’s victory, the   said he wants nothing to do with them.  ”I don’t want to energize the group, and I disavow the group,” he told the Times. ”It’s not a group I want to energize, and if they are energized, I want to look into it and find out why.” Also notable is what Trump didn’t do: He didn’t condemn the white supremacist groups like the National Policy Institute, which led the weekend gathering, by name    something that’s noticed every time Trump personally takes the time to slam the cast of ”Hamilton” or wade into other feuds on his Twitter account.  Trump also took flak recently after he tapped his campaign CEO Steve Bannon to be one of his top two advisers in the White House. Bannon, the former executive chairman of Breitbart News, touted the website as ”the platform for the  .” Bannon rejected the   and racist elements of the   in an interview with the Wall Street Journal this week and declared himself an ”economic nationalist.” Trump defended Bannon in his New York Times meeting, saying that he’s known him for ”a long time” and that the allegations of   and connections to the   are ”not him.” ”If I thought he was racist, or ’ ’ . .. I wouldn’t even think about hiring him,” Trump said Tuesday. Kushner the  ?  Trump laid out some lofty foreign policy ambitions.  ”I would love to be the one who made peace with Israel and the Palestinians. That would be such a great achievement,” he said, referring to a conflict that has vexed presidents for decades.  How is Trump going to do that?  It’s not clear    and Trump showed just how limited his foreign policy knowledge is when he suggested his    Jared Kushner, could help make peace between the Israelis and Palestinians.  Trump’s approach to foreign policy remains an open question. He did tell the Times, ”I don’t think we should be a  ”    an implicit shot at the American military’s role in the Iraq War. He also said ”we have to end that craziness that’s going on in Syria,” adding that he has a ”different view than everybody else” of that conflict    without explaining that view. What an age we live in, Trump hasn’t held a news conference in the 14 days since he won the election    the longest period of silence from a   in decades.  So when he met with The New York Times, the entire political world was watching. But not on screen    the meeting wasn’t   or televised.  Instead, the news came 140 characters at a time from the Twitter accounts of Times reporters like Maggie Haberman, Mike Grynbaum and Julie Davis, who were posting the  ’s remarks live.  Those tweets were being shown   as cable news networks covered the developments, with no audio and no video of Trump    just tweets containing his remarks. Perhaps fitting for a candidate and   who regularly makes news or causes controversy 140 characters at a time from his phone."
Hillary Clinton Crashes Bachelor Party: ‘I Love Having Men at My Feet’ - Breitbart,"Hillary Clinton dropped into a bar with her entourage and found herself crashing a bachelor party, a situation that turned into a photo op for the Democratic candidate for president. [Joe Schreck and his groomsmen were having a round of Bloody Marys to celebrate his upcoming wedding when Clinton and her campaign staff descended on Saffron, a café and bar in Charleston, South Carolina, reports the Washington Post.  “I love having men at my feet,” Clinton said, as her personal photographer, Barb Kinney, suggested some of the groomsmen kneel around Clinton for a photo. “This is exciting,” Clinton added. “That looks like a really good Bloody Mary. ” Schreck  —   who says he is a big fan of Clinton’s but is still undecided about whom he will vote for in the primary  —   invited Clinton to his wedding, but she declined."
Donald Trump Cuts Hillary Clinton’s Lead in Liberal Minnesota in Half - Breitbart,"A new poll finds that GOP nominee Donald Trump is tightening the polls even in liberal Minnesota where Hillary Clinton’s lead has been cut in half since last week. [A poll taken of 625 registered Minnesota voters ending on September 14 found that Hillary’s     lead in the deep blue state has been slashed to 6 points, according to the Minneapolis  .  Clinton now leads Trump 44 to 38 percent. But only a few months ago that spread was at 48 percent for Clinton to Trump’s 35 percent. While the state’s big cities favor Clinton 58 percent to Trump’s 28 percent, it is the outlying areas and suburbs where the GOP nominee is gaining. In the suburban areas, for instance, Trump leads Clinton 41 to 37 percent while, in the rural sectors of the North Star State, Trump tops Clinton by a more lopsided 44 to 28 percent. In addition, independents are choosing Trump over Clinton by a wide margin with 42 percent going for Trump and 32 percent for Clinton. The poll also found that fully ten percent of respondents are still undecided. The survey taken from September 12 to 14 has a margin of error at plus or minus four points.

Clinton Running Mate Tim Kaine Skips Flint Vote to Raise Campaign Dollars - Breitbart,"Senator Tim Kaine skipped a vote on Water Safety and Infrastructure that would affect the Flint, Michigan water crisis, choosing instead to raise campaign funds in Illinois. [Kaine’s running mate, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, beat the drum on the lead contamination in Flint, saying in a July campaign statement that “There is no excuse for what’s happening in Flint. ” Clinton professed “outrage” over the situation in Flint during an appearance on the Rachel Maddow Show, yet her own running mate Kaine chose to fundraise instead of serving in his current position in the Senate and voting on the legislation associated with investigating the Flint case and providing funding for other areas that face similar water crises.  Kaine was recorded as “not voting” on Wednesday on a motion to invoke cloture and move forward the Water Resources Development Act Of 2016. Congressional summary of S. 2848 states: Additional assistance is provided to states with emergency public health threats associated with lead or other contaminants in a public drinking water supply system. The Department of Justice and the inspector general of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must report on the status of any ongoing investigations into the government’s response to the drinking water contamination in Flint, Michigan. It would provide additional assistance to states with similar public health threats to public drinking water in the future. Instead of voting on the bill to help protect public drinking water, Kaine chose to raise campaign funds at two events in Chicago, Illinois according to the Chicago Sun Times. One of the events featuring Kaine is at the home of Bill Daley, former chief of staff to President Barack Obama and former commerce secretary for former President Bill Clinton. Daley’s wife Bernadette Keller is hosting along with him as well as Globetrotters Engineering CEO Niranjan Shah and daughter Smita Shah. Both Shahs are major Democratic donors, the elder Shah having financially backed former President Clinton and former Gov. of Illinois Rod Blagojevich, who is now in prison for corruption including trying to sell former Senator Obama’s seat in Congress. Attendees are responsible for paying or raising from $10, 000 to $50, 000. The second event is a reception at the home of art deal Paul Gray and his spouse De. Big Democratic donors John Atkinson and Grace   are also hosting along with Lilli Scheye, Jane and Bob Clark, and Steve Cohen, reports the Times. Attending that event runs from $5, 000 to $25, 000. Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump said at a Wednesday afternoon rally in Canton, Ohio, that he had just visited Flint, Michigan himself. “It should never happen in the United States of America,” he said. “This is the catastrophe that does happen when we build up other countries instead of our own. ” “It used to be, cars were made in Flint and you couldn’t drink the water in Mexico. Now the cars are made in Mexico and you can’t drink the water in Flint,” Trump said at the Wednesday rally. Flint’s Democratic mayor Karen Weaver endorsed Clinton over   Sen. Bernie Sanders in January. In March the International Business Times reported that during Clinton’s term as a U. S. Senator from New York, she opposed a bipartisan bill banning a controversial fuel additive, a possible carcinogen, that can seriously contaminate drinking water. The 2005 legislation stated that the compound had been found in U. S. water sources. The IBT report also noted that at the time she voted against the measure she was running for   and raised “more than $74, 000 from the oil and gas industry, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. ” Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana "
Would a Trump Presidency Mean Economic Disaster? Let’s Take a Look - The New York Times,"If Donald Trump were elected president and put in his stated policies, the United States would experience a lengthy recession, enormous job losses, much higher interest rates and diminished   growth prospects. At least, that is the conclusion of economists from Moody’s Analytics, a recent analysis highlighted by Hillary Clinton in a speech Tuesday. The Trump campaign has noted, accurately, that the lead author of the study, Mark Zandi, has informally advised the Obama administration and donated to Democratic campaigns. So what should a properly skeptical person think of the new report? Is it an accurate projection of what will happen to the economy if Mr. Trump’s preferred policies become law, or partisan  ? Given that a presidential campaign is a contest of competing forecasts, here’s how to think about the many predictions you’ll hear between now and November. A careful reading of the Moody’s report shows this: Its underlying assumptions about what Mr. Trump would do as president and how the effects of those policies would ripple through the economy are plausible, and squarely within the mainstream consensus view among economic forecasters about how the economy works. But the report also offers a big helping of false precision, giving exact numerical forecasts on effects that have vast amounts of uncertainty. It’s worth being skeptical about Moody’s projection that Trump’s policies would cause a 1. 5 percent contraction in gross domestic product in 2019. After all, forecasters aren’t even sure what G. D. P. growth will turn out to be in the second quarter of 2016, which ends in nine days. To forecast growth three years from now under an unknowable set of policies is more an intellectual exercise than anything exact. It’s not as useful to look at numerical projections that are almost certain to be wrong. Instead, let’s examine the analytical judgments underlying those numbers  —   and what they say about the direction of the economy in a Trump presidency: Tax cuts and larger deficits would stimulate at first, then cause a contraction. Mr. Trump has advocated major tax cuts, including reducing the highest income tax rate to 25 percent from 39. 6 percent and increasing the standard deduction for all filers. On spending, he has said he would maintain the military, Social Security and Medicare, and raise spending on veterans health care. These actions would stimulate the economy at first  —   the Moody’s projection has stronger growth in 2017 in a Trump administration than in a baseline case. But over time they would translate to higher deficits that would push interest rates much higher and crowd out other activity in the economy, given that they forecast the economy will be near its full potential when the next president takes office in January 2017. Moody’s predicts that Trump policies would push   Treasury bond yields to 8. 6 percent in 2018, compared with 1. 6 percent today and 3 percent in their base case  —   leading to a contraction in business investment, housing and consumer spending. The money the government would need to borrow to fund a much larger deficit would squeeze out business investment, housing and consumer spending. Mass deportations would be a negative supply shock. The simple version of this is that if there are fewer workers in the United States because the Trump administration deports millions of undocumented immigrants or makes life unpleasant enough for them that they leave voluntarily, the nations’s economic output would fall. As immigrants leave, the Moody’s researchers write, employers will struggle to fill the vacated jobs. “Many of these positions will go unfilled, because, by the time the Trump administration is underway, the U. S. is expected to be at full employment, meaning there will be no slack labor out of which to hire workers. ” Some businesses that are heavily reliant on immigrant labor would close. To the degree the labor shortage drives up wages, it would be counteracted by Federal Reserve interest rate increases to try to slow the economy and combat inflation. Trade wars would raise prices and reduce exports. The researchers assume a Trump administration would slap a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports and a 35 percent one on Mexican imports, which in the Moody’s model raises overall consumer prices by 3 percent. Meanwhile, they figure that a retaliatory response from China and Mexico would result in new tariffs and lower American exports to those countries, reducing economic activity. And higher interest rates in the United States and a sense of global uncertainty around a potential trade war would drive up the dollar, making all United States exporters less competitive. These underlying assumptions, while built on a large body of economic research, involve some guesswork and are at least debatable. Conservatives have long argued that lower taxes on the wealthy will generate more investment and economic activity, which would offset some of the increased deficits evident in the Moody’s model. Immigration skeptics might argue that an exit of undocumented immigrants would drive up wages and would pull more   workers into the labor force who are currently out of it. Perhaps Mr. Trump’s plans for tough negotiation with China and Mexico really would yield new, more favorable arrangements that don’t create import inflation or a trade war that reduces exports. But while the predictions of a recession and slower   growth got all the attention in the new report, understanding why these particular economic forecasters see these effects is more useful. And there’s a lesson there in making sense of any forecast or analysis of a candidate’s policies: Focus less on the conclusion, and more on how the researcher got there."
"Turkey Bombs U.S.-Supported Kurds in Syria, at Least 18 Killed","Early Tuesday morning, a wave of Turkish airstrikes reportedly struck a headquarters building used by the Kurdish YPG militia in northeastern Syria. The   Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 18 YPG fighters and media officials were killed in the attack. [Turkey also conducted airstrikes in the Sinjar region of Iraq, ostensibly aimed at the militant Kurdish separatists of the PKK. However, Kurdish Peshmerga forces in Iraq  —   another key U. S. military ally against the Islamic State  —   also said the Turks hit their positions, killing five of their troops.  The YPG released a statement saying its headquarters in Mount Karachok near the   border was hit by Turkish planes, damaging a media center, radio broadcast facilities, and military installations. The YPG described Turkey’s attack as “treacherous” and “barbaric” and even accused the Turks of attempting to undermine the planned offensive against Raqqa, the Syrian capital of the Islamic State. Critics of Turkey have accused it of tacitly supporting ISIS against the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria and of covertly profiting from trade with the Islamic State. Syrian Kurdish leader Salih Muslim asked the United States to defend them against further Turkish strikes. “A people that is fighting terrorism is being stabbed in the back. Coalition forces must not remain silent against this. No one should accept these attacks,” Muslim said. The Turkish military said these airstrikes were intended to stop the PKK from smuggling weapons into Turkey. A statement from the military described the targets as “terrorists” and “terror hubs. ” According to the Turkish military, 70 militants were killed in the airstrikes. The PKK recently claimed responsibility for a bomb attack on a police compound in southeastern Turkey that killed three people. The attackers dug a tunnel beneath the compound to plant what they described as “more than 2. 5 tonnes of explosives. ” Turkey accuses other Kurdish forces, particularly the YPG in Syria, of being in league with the PKK. The PKK does have a presence in the Sinjar region, in part because it came to the aid of the Yazidi minority when ISIS tried to exterminate them. The PKK has been training and arming Yazidis to fight the Islamic State and has said it will not withdraw from Sinjar until Yazidi forces control the area. The Kurdish administration has been urging Yazidis to join the Peshmerga and other militia units instead of the PKK. Peshmerga commanders have asked the PKK to withdraw from the area. This is a difficult conflict for the United States to negotiate. On the one hand, Turkey is a NATO member and an important regional ally the U. S. is nervous about alienating. The U. S. classifies the PKK as a terrorist organization, just as Turkey does. On the other hand, the Peshmerga and YPG are crucial American battlefield allies against the Islamic State. The Peshmerga and YPG have also clashed among themselves, even while both cooperate with the United States. American military officials reportedly visited the Mount Karachok region by helicopter on Tuesday to assess the damage from Turkey’s airstrikes. Turkey’s Daily Sabah, which has a   bent, began its report on the visit by    stating the YPG is an “offshoot” of the PKK terrorist group and said banners depicting jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan can be seen in the background of photos that showed U. S. officials walking with YPG representatives. The U. S.  coalition in Iraq and Syria issued a statement encouraging all forces in the region to “concentrate their efforts on ISIS and not toward objectives that may cause the Coalition to divert energy and resources away from the defeat of ISIS in Iraq and Syria. ” The Iraqi Foreign Ministry denounced Turkey’s strikes as a violation of its sovereignty, warned that a larger Turkish   military incursion would “destabilize northern Iraq,” and asked the international community to block further “interference” by Turkey."
7 special-needs teens removed from Texas home," (CNN) They were regularly locked in a closet with a deadbolt for so long that they urinated on themselves among the clothes and boxes. They had never attended school even though they were teenagers with special needs. One child with Down syndrome was found wearing a dirty diaper in the home in Richmond, Texas.  Their diet included rice and beans three times a day, a man who lived in the home told   affiliate KPRC. These are the conditions that Texas authorities said they found seven malnourished adopted teenagers living in in Richmond, 31 miles southwest of Houston. The five boys and two girls range in age from 14 to 16, officials said.  ”I cannot think of a more deplorable situation than what we have learned in this case,” Fort Bend County Sheriff Troy E. Nehls said in a news release. ”These people are taking advantage of a lousy situation at the expense of children who cannot fend for themselves. It is absolutely heartbreaking.”  The children were removed from the home on November 23 after the Fort Bend County Sheriff’s Office investigated a case they had received from the state Child Protective Services Division, Tiffani Butler, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, told CNN on Tuesday.  On Saturday, the Fort Bend County Sheriff’s Office arrested Allen Richardson, 78, and Paula Sinclair, 54, the teenagers’ adopted mother, in connection with the investigation into physical abuse at Richardson’s home, where Sinclair lived with her children.  Sinclair, who has a Houston address, and Richardson, the Richmond resident also known as ”Coach,” face charges of aggravated kidnapping, a   felony and injury to a   injury, a   felony, authorities said. Authorities said the seven teens were locked in the closet, roughly   by   in size, when Sinclair needed to take Richardson to the hospital.   A judge on Tuesday granted a mediated settlement agreement allowing Child Protective Services to maintain temporary custody of the children, who have been in state custody since they were removed from the home, Butler said.  Deadbolt locks on the doors, Authorities said the children were also struck with a wooden paddle, causing injury.  ”Doorknobs on the main door and closet door had been removed and replaced with deadbolt locks opened only by a key . .. the children were left in there, living altogether,” Julie Johnson, with the Fort Bend County Sheriff’s Office, told CNN affiliate KTRK in Houston. Johnson said, ”The carpet was being pulled up, the metal tacks were exposed, clutter everywhere, soiled laundry.” The children, who have been hospitalized since being removed from the home, are recovering, Butler said.  Sinclair and Richardson are being held in the Fort Bend County Jail, officials said.  Richmond attorney Corinna Steele, who represents Sinclair in the civil custody case, declined to comment Tuesday.  It was not immediately clear if either Sinclair or Richardson had attorneys in their criminal cases.  Sinclair received up to $540 in monthly subsidies for each   child, Butler said. Sinclair’s husband, who didn’t live in the home where the children were found, has not been charged, Fort Bend authorities said. One adopted child died in 2011, Butler said Sinclair was initially a foster parent for the seven children before adopting them with her husband between April 2003 and October 2004. The couple also adopted an eighth child     a      boy    who died in January 2011, Butler said.  Butler said the CPS policy is to do background checks on potential foster parents, along with home studies. The children also live with the prospective parent for at least six months before a judge finalizes the adoption, Butler said. She said CPS does not maintain contact with adoptive families once the adoption is granted, unless there is a complaint of abuse or neglect.  In January 2011, the agency investigated the child’s death, Butler said. ”The children were not removed from the home at the time,” she said. Fort Bend County Sheriff’s spokesperson Caitilin Espinosa said a doctor determined that the    died from natural causes. Espinosa said the death occurred at a home where Sinclair previously lived. Sinclair and the children moved to Richardson’s home about two years ago, Espinosa said. The relationship between Sinclair and Richardson is unclear. Neither is cooperating with authorities, Espinosa said.   The next time CPS was alerted to the family was on November 22, when the agency received a tip, said Butler, who declined to reveal more information. A case worker visited that day and the agency contacted Fort Bend authorities, she said.  The Fort Bend County Sheriff’s Office said it received a case for a   investigation on November 23.  Authorities said one room in the home smelled of urine and feces and the children wore shabby clothes.  Fed beans and rice three times a day, Sinclair also operated a group home for adults at the house and three men lived downstairs in the home, authorities said.  One resident, David Willard, told CNN affiliate KPRC the adults and the children were not allowed to interact. Willard also described the home as a ”prison.” ”I have never been upstairs,” Willard said. ”I have never been upstairs in five months. Of course, I was told not to speak to anybody here.” Willard said the children had to eat the beans and rice they were fed three times a day in their rooms.  ”They’d go to the bottom of the stairs, the kids would wait and Coach would bring them a tray with beans and rice, three times a day. That’s how they were fed,” he said. Butler said state officials want to keep the children together.  ”It’s definitely a situation that we wouldn’t want to see any child in, especially children that we’ve taken care of before,” Butler said, KPRC reported. ”That’s something, unfortunately, that we see sometimes.”  Butler added: ”We want them in a better situation.”  Correction: A previous version of this story misstated when the Fort Bend County Sheriff’s Office arrested Allen Richardson and Paula Sinclair. It was Saturday, December 3, 2016."

Meadows ’intrigued’ on Obamacare change after Pence meeting," (CNN) President Donald Trump’s administration had meetings Monday with two key groups of Republicans, whose split over health care policy caused GOP leaders to pull a plan last month to repeal and replace Obamacare.  Emerging from a meeting Monday night with Vice President Mike Pence, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows said his group was ”intrigued” by an idea the White House floated to give states more flexibility to opt out of Obamacare regulations using a waiver process, but Meadows wouldn’t promise the Freedom Caucus would be on board in the end.    ”No one made any definitive changes in terms of moving from ’no’ to ’yes’ primarily because there is not enough detail to do so,” Meadows said. ”But I can tell you all the ’no’s,’ every one of the ’no’s,’ expressed a willingness to look at this in a very detailed manner.” While Meadows stressed that there was no deal in principle and members were still awaiting legislative text to be finalized in the next 24 hours, the general idea would be that states could chose not to require insurers to cover things like ”essential health benefits” required under Obamacare now. That would mean insurers would not have to cover services like hospitalization or maternity care. Conservatives have wanted to remove that requirement in any GOP passed plan, while some moderates have wanted to keep them in.  Also on the table, Meadows said, was the idea that insurers could opt out of community health ratings, which currently ban insurers from charging higher premiums based on gender or health history. Meadows continued to stress that while he was pleased with the progress, there wasn’t any final deal. Members of the House Freedom Caucus have been the target of the White House’s ire in recent days, with Trump tweeting directly at specific members after they were opposed to the health care bill. When asked about timeline, Meadows demurred saying only that he didn’t want to put an ”artificial” deadline on the process. Leadership aides stressed that the Freedom Caucus was having productive discussions.  Earlier Monday, some House members who are part of the moderate Tuesday Group met at the White House to discuss changes to the health care bill supported by Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan. Those moderates met with Pence, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden.  At the Tuesday Group meeting, the sampling of moderates included Reps. Pat Tiberi, Rodney Davis, Tom MacArthur and others.  Those participating in the Tuesday Group meeting were all members who’d originally expressed support for the GOP health care plan. They discussed changing the bill slightly so that some states would be able to opt out of some Obamacare regulations.  ”We appreciated then coming to us with it,” Collins said of the meeting. Collins added he thinks there has been some ”soul searching,” but stressed this is not a deal. "
"Merkel Warned Support Being ’Destroyed’ by Failure to Deport 500,000 Asylum Seekers","German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been warned public support is being “destroyed” by the fact her government has so far failed to deport half a million rejected asylum seekers.[  Friedrich, an MP for the Bavarian Christian Social Union, Mrs. Merkel’s sister party, said the German people were losing confidence in the government because so many asylum seekers were able to “dance around the state”.  Meanwhile, Rainer Wendt, head of the federal police trade union, warned: “There is a deportation prevention industry, which must be changed urgently. ” Figures published by the German parliament on Monday showed a total of 556, 499 failed asylum seekers have stayed on in the country, with four in five residing in the country for more than six years, thus granting them extra rights. The Times reports around half are officially stateless, have medical conditions, or would not be accepted back into their home country, giving them a right to stay indefinitely. Others simply stayed in illegally or claimed to have no identity papers. Of the half a million failed asylum seekers, 77, 000 are from Turkey, 68, 000 from Kosovo, 50, 000 from Serbia, and 33, 000 from Afghanistan. “Allowing rejected asylum seekers to dance around the state like this is destroying the confidence of citizens in the capacity of the state to act,” said Mr. Friedrich, who also previously served as interior minister. Breitbart London reported last month on figures that showed some 99 per cent of migrants granted asylum in Germany were allowed to stay permanently. An investigation by Die Welt found that although asylum is granted for a period of three years under the Geneva Convention, nearly all German migrants granted asylum are allowed to stay indefinitely. Despite an attempt to tighten up residency permits last year, leave the stay is granted much more quickly in Germany than in other European Union states."
"Protests, counterprotest outside Phoenix mosque","Phoenix (CNN) Protesters at Friday’s ”Freedom of Speech” rally outside a Phoenix mosque were met by counterprotesters. The two groups lined both sides of the street in front of the Islamic Community Center of Phoenix and yelled at each other, with a line of police officers standing in the middle of the street to keep them separated, CNN affiliate KNXV reported.  Jon Ritzheimer, organizer of the rally, is a former Marine, and he has no middle ground when it comes to Islam. His   pretty much says it all:  ”    Islam.” Some of the counterprotesters wore shirts that said, ”Love Thy Neighbor.” The Islamic Community Center of Phoenix is the mosque that Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi attended for a time. They’re the men who drove from Arizona to a Dallas suburb to shoot up a Prophet Mohammed cartoon contest there. Both were killed by police early this month. Many Muslims consider demeaning depictions of Mohammed to be blasphemous and banned by Islamic law. The rally, ”This is in response to the recent attack in Texas where 2 armed terrorist( s) with ties to ISIS, attempted Jihad,” the event’s Facebook page said. Some 600 people said they would attend. The rally was to start about the same time evening prayers were taking place inside the center. The rally was to feature its own cartoon contest, similar to the one targeted in Texas. ”I think the whole thing, the cartoon contest especially, I think it’s stupid and ridiculous,” Ritzheimer said beforehand, ”but it’s what needs to take place in order to expose the true colors of Islam.” D. C. Metro ending   ads after Mohammed submission, Local Muslim leaders say they won’t be intimidated. ”The Muslim community in America is here to stay and we are also well aware of the right to speak our mind and worship how we please,” Dr. Yasir Shareef, a board member of the Arizona chapter of the Council on   Relations, said at a press conference. The White House says there’s no justification for violence at the rally. ”Even expressions that are offensive, that are distasteful, and intended to sow divisions in an otherwise   diverse community in Phoenix cannot be used as a justification to carry out an act of violence,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. Police Chief Joe Yahner was personally involved in arranging public safety around the event, he told CNN affiliate KPHO. ”There’s a lot of things in the works. The intelligence related to the crowd is changing all the time,” he said. Gov. Doug Ducey hoped common sense will prevail in the event, he said. ”Of course, I’m a believer in free speech and the First Amendment. I’m also a believer in good judgment and common sense,” he told the affiliate. Police were to use cameras to record the event ”to capture things that go on” and were to close roads, said Sgt. Trent Crump, a Phoenix police spokesman. So far, the event seemed to be attracting a variety of people. ”It is a very scattered group of individuals with different causes that for the most part are signing on and signing up to come to this,” Crump said. Cartoon ads, The rally comes as some groups have made a deliberate effort not to be cowed by Islamic extremists, like the ones who attacked the Paris offices of the the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The publication often featured caricatures of Mohammed. In Washington, activist and conservative blogger Pamela Geller of New York wanted to place ads showing cartoons of Mohammed in the capital’s transit system. She hoped to show the winning cartoon from her group’s contest in Texas the one where Simpson and Soofi were killed by police. The Washington Metro board balked. It voted to stop showing   ads throughout its system. A worried community, Events like this one and other developments have Muslims in the area scared, said Imraan Siddiqi with the Council on   Relations. ”Recently, the mosques here in Phoenix actually received threatening letters    very specific threats, saying that we are going to massacre your congregations,” he said. Ritzheimer anticipates possible problems because of the rally and says people should bring their guns. ”People are also encouraged to utilize (their) second amendment right at this event just (in case) our first amendment comes under the much anticipated attack,” the event’s Facebook page says. Bikers will be there too, according to the post. Siddiqi calls it the ”intersection of Islamophobia and (the) gun culture.” ”When we see these two things . .. then obviously it becomes more of a concern,” he said. ”We’re advising people . .. it’s better to stay clear from the event, don’t engage with these people.”  Why Islam forbids images of Mohammed"
The Most Detailed Map of Gay Marriage in America - The New York Times,"More than three years after a Supreme Court decision gave federal recognition to   marriages performed in states that allowed them, the demographics of   married couples largely remain a mystery. In fact, no one has a definitive count of gay married couples in the United States. One reason it’s hard to get a fix on the marriages is that detailed marriage records are not tracked at the federal level. They’re managed by counties and states, which report the count of marriages and not much else. The Census Bureau isn’t always a lot of help either. Methodological problems like sample size and false positives have long plagued census estimates of this relatively small group. But a new research paper published by the Treasury Department on Monday has found an interesting way around these problems: tax records. By linking the tax returns of   couples who filed jointly in 2014 with their Social Security records, researchers are able to give us the most accurate picture of   marriages to date. And their estimate is this: In 2014 there were 183, 280   marriages in America, roughly a third of 1 percent of all marriages. Of course, implicit in this estimate is the assumption that all married couples file their returns jointly. But as a proxy for that, it’s pretty good. The Treasury Department estimates that 97. 5 percent of married couples who file taxes file them jointly. One highlight of the study: Pretax household income of   married couples is higher than that of heterosexual married couples. Most of that is driven by the average earnings of male   couples: $176, 000. On average, they make $52, 000 more than married lesbian couples and $63, 000 more than married straight couples. Lee Badgett, an economics professor at the University of   said one reason is the gender pay gap. The math here is simple  —   for heterosexual couples, the gender pay gap affects one partner. For   female couples, the gender pay gap affects both partners. But that doesn’t explain why   female married couples earn more than heterosexual married couples, over all. The other key component is geography. The tax data shows   married couples clustering along the coasts, and in urban pockets across the United States. These are regions that also tend to have higher wages. In fact, heterosexual couples actually earn more than   female ones when you compare married couples who live in the same   ZIP code region. Child care plays a huge role as well.   female couples are four times more likely to have children than   male couples. That means that many women will have to make tough   between career and family. Combine that with the likelihood of lower pay to begin with and you start to understand why the income differences are so large. There is one group whose incomes are far above the rest:   married men with children. Their income is roughly $275, 000, more than double the pretax income for heterosexual couples and   married female couples with children. This is a select group of people for whom the cost of children is particularly high. Using a surrogate can cost $250, 000, and adoptions can cost upward of $30, 000. The data also reveals another, more subtle geographical difference in male vs. female   married couples. The top 20 cities for male   married couples are more likely to include dense city centers like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, while the top 20 cities for female   married couples tend to include smaller and   cities like Springfield, Mass. Madison, Wis. and Burlington, Vt. Women gravitated toward commitment more than men. Among the   marriages, 55 percent involved   women and 45 percent   men. Those in   marriages tend to be a little younger than those in straight marriages. The average age of   filers is 47, while the average age for those in straight couples is 51. The Treasury’s tally of   marriages is very different from that of the census  —   roughly half what the census estimates. It doesn’t rely on samples as the census does, but uses all the tax records in America. This difference is particularly important when it comes to counting gay and lesbian populations. For detailed records of American life, the Census Bureau usually employs surveys of a small but statistically representative sample of Americans. Normally that is sufficient for most kinds of estimates such as average family sizes, car ownership or other measures. The problem with estimating gay and lesbian populations is that they represent such a small fraction of the total population any mistakes in how people answered their census forms are likely to push the number of gay couples and, in particular, gay married couples wildly out of focus. And in fact, this is what happened in the 2000 census and again in 2010. One of the more interesting problems was that many straight couples were being classified as gay because of incorrectly checked boxes on a census form. This resulted, according to some estimates, in as much as a 25 percent overcount of gay couples. How did the Census Bureau try to control for this error? Simple. By taking names. It turns out that, even today, most first names are strongly associated with one gender. Using a database of gender probabilities for each given name, the bureau was able go back and correct the misreporting. But Gary Gates, former research director at the Williams Institute, notes it’s likely that some errors persist. The Census Bureau has been pretty upfront about its problems and even produced a delightfully nerdy video about its mistakes. Which is why the Treasury’s use of administrative data is so important. The joint tax returns were matched with the Social Security Administration’s data, so there’s less chance that gender is misreported. To be fair, tax records can give an incomplete picture, but the problem is more political than methodological. After the Windsor case was decided by the Supreme Court in 2013,   marriage was still not recognized in every state. So gay couples who crossed state borders to marry, but lived in states that did not recognize gay marriage, were not allowed to file jointly on their state tax returns. Instead of trying to file a joint return for federal taxes and separate returns for state taxes, many couples opted to file separately on both their state and federal return. This changed after Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 Supreme Court decision that recognized gay marriage in all states. But the Treasury’s data ends in 2014. So the Treasury data is most likely undercounting   marriages in more than a dozen states that did not recognize such marriages before the Obergefell decision. Maybe the best way to think about these Treasury numbers is as a floor, lower than the hypothetically perfect count of gay marriage but the closest we’ve ever come to one. And if the Treasury researchers produce similar reports for 2015 and 2016, we will be even closer."
Linda Tripp: Hillary Threw Hard Objects at Bill Clinton,"NEW YORK  —   In an exclusive interview, Linda Tripp, a former White House staffer whose workspace was located directly adjacent to Hillary Clinton’s second floor West Wing office, confirmed   accounts of the former First Lady throwing hard objects at Bill Clinton. [Tripp further described what she characterized as Hillary Clinton’s significant temperament issues, including “endless screaming” and the constant use of profanity, as well as a general disdain for the U. S. electorate, the Armed Services and the honor and dignity of the institution of the American presidency, calling her public persona a “smoke and mirrors act. ”  Tripp further stated that as early as the first days of the Bill Clinton administration there was already talk amongst senior staff about a future Hillary Clinton presidency, a position to which Hillary Clinton believed herself entitled. Tripp spoke in an   interview that aired on this reporter’s Sunday night talk radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia. Listen to Part One of the Linda Tripp interview: The issue of temperament has become a central theme of this year’s presidential election, with both Clinton and Donald Trump constantly accusing each other of lacking the trait many voters find so necessary to serving as the nation’s highest executive. Tripp said Clinton’s method of attacking Trump on temperament is “positively  ” for “those of us who did get a   peek behind the Clinton curtain. ” Stated Tripp: “The voting public will never see behind the Clinton mask. But if they could they would see what I saw behind closed doors all of those years ago. They’d see a completely different human being from the one presented to the voters. Because in Hillary they’d see a coarse, profane political operative. With no moral compass. And a complete willingness to manipulate the rule of law to her benefit. They would see a fearsome, paranoid individual with zero concern for the masses. She sees the voting block merely as a necessary evil to achieve her goals. She is a total impressive smoke and mirrors act. ” Listen to Part Two of the Linda Tripp interview: Tripp revealed some of what she personally witnessed firsthand of Clinton’s temperament and the way she says White House staff feared the First Lady to the point of “cowering” in her presence. “In the Clinton White House there was endless screaming,” she recalled. “Constant vulgar profanity on the part of both the President and the First Lady. And it’s hard for me to refer to her as the First Lady, frankly. “You’ve heard all about the hurling of hard objects. All of that was true. But what you haven’t heard is the cowering of the White House staff in her presence. There was a contempt for the military. And this is a woman who believes she is entitled to be   . And that was very, very difficult for me. Having had a   history with the military. And a deep, abiding respect for all the members of the Armed Services. She had a hatred of Republicans. And I have think we have seen that with her basket of deplorables (comments). Sometimes the truth just peaks out. ” Asked whether she actually saw Hillary throw hard objects at Bill Clinton, Tripp replied, “No, we just saw the result on the president’s face. Literally. ” She continued: “I know that that sounds scandalous. And that sounds as though that couldn’t possibly be true. But 99% of the scandals are completely unbelievable to those who didn’t see behind the [Clinton] curtain. You know, it’s almost a piling on kind of a thing. Because most people in their average everyday lives, they are going to work they are driving the kids to soccer there is homework there are bills to pay. They don’t pay as close attention as someone like myself might because they’re just too darn busy. And it sounds like what the Clintons constantly say. That it’s the partisan  . That it’s the vast   conspiracy. Everyone conspires against the Clintons. They take no ownership or accountability for all of the scandals they themselves created. “But it’s completely understandable to me why most people would think that this can’t possibly be true. This is not the person we see debating. And she is a polished debater. You know this just can’t be true and yet it is. ” Listen to Part Three of the Linda Tripp interview: “I just think that when you talk about temperament you have to at least consider how the past portends the future,” Tripp added. The Clintons possessed no respect or honor for the office of the presidency, Tripp charged: “I remember a senior adviser to President Bush. A nice guy. I am not going to name his name. But a very senior advisor who had said to a few of us one day that he pinched himself every single day that he entered the White House to go to work. And he said further if you don’t feel that way you don’t belong here. And it resonated because those of us who did feel that way thought, ‘Ah, it’s not just us. There is a reverence. There is an honor.’ A feeling of history that we are so fortunate to be a part of. Of course, none of that pertains to the Clintons. ” Hillary Clinton has in the past claimed numerous times that she was not yet decided on whether to run for president. One notorious example was Clinton’s response to why she took   speaking fees from Goldman Sachs and other big Wall Street banks. “I wasn’t committed to running. I didn’t know whether I would or not,” Clinton said in February. Tripp scoffed at the notion that Hillary was contemplating running for the presidency. “Well, this is one of the funniest things because literally on my first day in the West Wing of the White House in January of 1993, right after the inauguration, there was a chant from various senior advisors to support staff of the president. And it was ‘Eight years for Bill. Eight years for Hill.’ In fact, some had started out with ‘Four years for Bill. Four years for Hill.’ And they were quickly corrected. But I didn’t know at that time that this runaway train was actually going to happen. Or worse, what it means for all of us today. “And you know she had a plan to punch her ticket. And so to punch the ticket to get to the presidency you need to have a resume. And so the whole Senate thing was part of the plan. ” Tripp spoke generally of various ethical concerns during her time working in the West Wing: “Both the Clintons operate from a position of ethical bankruptcy. And in doing so they have been stacking the deck for many years. They have ensured they are above the law, as we saw this year. So whether it was obstructing justice or hiding documents. You know the abusing and besmirching of women. Their patented strategy of personal destruction of those who would speak out against them. And perjury. They have insulated themselves with total political power. And the accumulation of vast wealth. Those are hard things to go up against. So it’s worked well for them  …     And there was always the commingling and the   . And I mean from the smallest way to the largest way. There was the wholesale selling of the Lincoln bedroom. And rides on Air Force One. And money all the time. It was just very difficult for someone who had seen another White House operate in a way that one would expect a White House to operate. ” Listen to Part Four of the Linda Tripp interview: Tripp is   for her role in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, documenting evidence of the young intern’s relationship with Bill Clinton and submitting the documentation to independent counsel Kenneth Starr, leading to the public disclosure of the affair. However, many people may be surprised to learn of Tripp’s larger role in the West Wing, and her firsthand experiences behind the curtain of the Clinton scandal machine. Tripp was brought to the Clinton administration from the George H. W. Bush White House, where she served as executive assistant to the deputy chief of staff to the president, a role that enabled her to become familiar with the inner workings of the West Wing. During the Clinton administration, she first served as support staff to the Immediate Office of the President, where she sat just outside Bill Clinton’s Oval Office. After three months, Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster asked Tripp to work for the White House Counsel’s office as executive assistant to White House Counsel Bernie Nussbaum, who played a lead role in defending the Clintons in their infamous scandals. Last week, Breitbart News reported on the first part of Clinton’s interview on “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” in which she discussed some of the most infamous scandals to rock the Bill Clinton White House. Tripp possesses insider information on the scandals known as Travelgate, Filegate and Whitewater, and she personally witnessed the handling of documents from Vince Foster’s office the morning after he was found dead in an apparent suicide. Foster was heavily involved in defending the Clintons in the Travelgate, Filegate and Whitewater cases. Tripp was the last person known to have spoken to Foster before his death.

Rick Ross arrested on suspicion of drug possession," (CNN) Rapper Rick Ross was picked up by sheriffs in Fayette County, Georgia, on suspicion of marijuana possession Wednesday afternoon, according to the Fayette County Sheriff’s Office. He was released Wednesday night after posting a $2, 400 bond, county officials said.  Deputies stopped Ross’ Bentley because of a possible a window tint violation and were talking to him when an officer allegedly smelled marijuana coming from the car. Sheriff Barry H. Babb said Ross gave consent to search the vehicle, and a deputy found marijuana. Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, was booked into the Fayette County jail and later posted bond.

Hungary Brands London a ’No-Go Zone’ Due To High Immigration,"Britain’s Foreign Office has complained after an official Hungarian leaflet claimed London and other major cities across Europe had become “ ” zones due to mass immigration. [The leaflet, sent by the Hungarian government to millions of households ahead of the referendum on migrant quotas, lists London alongside Berlin, Stockholm, Marseille, Copenhagen and Brussels as being among “hundreds of   areas”.  Foreign Office officials told Britain’s FT that it had complained to the Hungarian government about “wilful misrepresentation” of the situation. The ambassadors of France, Denmark, Sweden and Belgium had also complained. However, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has defended the claims. He told BBC Newsnight the leaflet was “based on official reports from police and other security agencies”. Mass immigration has led to a crime wave and increased the likelihood of terror attacks, the Hungarian government says, adding that authorities were struggling to maintain order in some 900 areas across the continent. “The values of the host society can barely be maintained,” it says. A French official protested the leaflet, claiming: “This strange concept of   zones does not exist in French reality. The law of the French republic is applied in all parts of French territory. ” European governments have become especially sensitive to accusations they have allowed areas of their cities to become “  zones” where extremism grows and authorities rarely uphold the law. Some go as far as denying such places even exist. Most recently it became a topic in run up to Britain’s EU membership referendum, with an   man challenging then Prime Minister David Cameron on the issue during a televised debate. Harry Bhopara told Mr Cameron how rising levels of immigration were making the town he grew up in less safe: “I have no GP, as all of them are full in my area. I can’t get onto the housing ladder and have three kids in one room. My kids’ school is growing in size every year but not in staff. The place where I grew up was a lovely area but is now a   zone. ” The former Prime Minister failed to answer the point, however, instead moving on the topic of the economy. "
"Advertisers Bow to Activist Left, Begin Pulling Ads from Hannity - Breitbart","A number of companies have pulled ads from Fox News host Sean Hannity’s show Hannity after he pledged to continue investigating circumstances surrounding the death of murdered DNC employee Seth Rich. [Companies including Cars. com, Peloton, and Leesa Sleep have all given in to pressure to cease advertising on the show over Hannity’s pursuit of now retracted claims made by Fox News that murdered DNC employee Seth Rich had contact with Wikileaks before his death.  After Rich’s family sent a letter to Fox demanding that Hannity stop discussing the former DNC staffer’s murder, Hannity said he would do so “out of respect for the family’s wishes. ” “I totally and completely understand how upset and how hard this is on this family, especially over the recent coverage of Seth’s death,” he said. “I’ve been communicating with them. I got a very heartfelt note. I also sent them a heartfelt note back. ” “However, out of respect for the family’s wishes, for now, I am not discussing this matter at this time,” Hannity continued, although he later contended that he had “retracted nothing” and would continue to “try to get to the truth. ” In a series of tweets on Wednesday, Hannity accused figures including George Soros, David Brock of Media Matters, and failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton of “liberal fascism,” after his advertisers were reportedly “inundated with emails” from   groups asking them to stop advertising on the show.

Shock Berkeley Poll: California Voters Want Democrats to Work with Trump - Breitbart,"A new poll by the Institute of Governmental Studies (IGS) at UC Berkeley shows that a majority of registered voters in California want the state’s elected Democrats to work with President Donald Trump rather than to resist his agenda. [The poll reveals that “by a 53% to 47% margin, slightly more voters prefer that when state leaders disagree with the president they should try to work with him even if it means making compromises, rather than opposing him if it risks negative consequences and losses in federal funding. ”   Voters prefer that Democrats work with Trump even though 61% disapprove of the job he is doing, according to the poll, which surveyed 1, 000 registered voters and has a margin of error of 3. 6%. In fact, the poll found that Trump has lower approval ratings than any U. S. president at this point in his presidency since the poll began, with President John F. Kennedy in 1961. In addition, the poll finds that Californians reject “CalExit” and proposals to secede from the Union by more than a    margin, 68% to 32%. Republicans (85% no, 15% yes) are more opposed than Democrats (56% no, 44% yes) to seceding. The poll also found that California voters approve of Trump’s policies on infrastructure, the economy and jobs  —   and disapprove of his policies on every other issue. Trump rated lowest on his policies on the environment, and on minority groups. Illegal immigration was a closer call, with 38% of California’s registered voters approving of his policies and 49% disapproving, as the state’s Democrats prepare for a showdown with Trump over the contentious issue of sanctuary cities.

Fox News Names 2 Insiders to Top Posts - The New York Times,"In assuming the leadership of Fox News last month, Rupert Murdoch pledged a fresh start at a network reeling from accusations that its longtime chairman, Roger Ailes, had overseen a culture of harassment and intimidation. But on Friday, Mr. Murdoch made clear that  —   for now at least  —   Fox’s new era will be led by its old guard. Two veteran executives with deep ties to Mr. Ailes were named   of Fox News, the network announced, a nod toward corporate stability that was also taken as a sign that Mr. Murdoch was not yet prepared to fully overhaul management at one of his most profitable franchises. Bill Shine, an affable Ailes loyalist who is well liked by some of the network’s   anchors, like Sean Hannity, will oversee programming at Fox News and Fox Business Network. Jack Abernethy, a trusted Murdoch hand who runs Fox’s television station group, was placed in charge of business operations, including finance and advertising sales. The appointments are Mr. Murdoch’s first major personnel moves at the network since the ouster of Mr. Ailes, whose   tenure was upturned by sexual harassment allegations by a former anchor, Gretchen Carlson. And it suggested that Mr. Murdoch and his sons, James and Lachlan, are now focused on calming an unsettled newsroom, even as more women come forward with troubling stories about the network’s culture under Mr. Ailes. “Anybody who expected seismic changes was wrong,” said Andrew Heyward, a former president of CBS News. “This sends a strong signal to a jittery, shaken staff that Fox News plans to stay the course. ” Mr. Murdoch, 85, who named himself executive chairman of Fox News on Friday, is expected to take a   role there at least through the presidential election in November. Since becoming acting chief executive in July, Mr. Murdoch has been a constant presence in the Manhattan newsroom, piping up at news meetings and greeting employees in the hall. He recently moved into Mr. Ailes’s corner office on the second floor. Still, the fallout from the scandal is not over: An investigation by the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison into other allegations against Mr. Ailes is continuing. The inquiry has expanded into whether other executives knew of any improper behavior and failed to act on it. On Friday, Fox also announced that its longtime chief financial officer, Mark Kranz, would retire. His departure was linked to his oversight of the network’s finances during a period when financial settlements were made with women who had complained of harassment, according to two people who requested anonymity to describe internal matters. Fox News is a significant source of profit for its parent company, 21st Century Fox, and the Murdochs would prefer smooth operations at the cable channel during a tumultuous election season that has resulted in record ratings. The elder Mr. Murdoch has said he is committed to maintaining Fox’s “distinctive, powerful” voice, curbing the predictions of those who thought that the   views of Fox’s opinion anchors might soften in the absence of Mr. Ailes. Mr. Shine, 53, has been with Fox since shortly after the channel debuted in 1996. He is a favored figure among some veteran anchors, including Mr. Hannity, who first recommended him to Mr. Ailes for a job. A Long Island native, Mr. Shine cut his teeth at the network producing Mr. Hannity’s program and working closely with personalities like Bill O’Reilly. His appointment was widely viewed as a sign of stability at a chaotic time, particularly with newsroom gossip focused on whether   anchors could leave in the wake of Mr. Ailes’s departure. Since Ms. Carlson went public with her allegations on July 6, a schism has developed within Fox News between Fox News loyalists  —   some of whom owe their careers to Mr. Ailes  —   upset at his ouster and others who either did not come forward or were dismayed by those who were defending Mr. Ailes before the investigation was complete. “I could not be happier with the new management team at Fox News Channel,” the anchor Greta Van Susteren, who also worked closely with Mr. Shine, wrote on Twitter on Friday. “Each is well liked and well respected Thank you Rupert!” Still, Mr. Shine was considered one of Mr. Ailes’s most loyal lieutenants. And his name, along with those of other executives, surfaced in recent accounts by two women who came forward to describe difficult experiences at Fox News. Andrea Tantaros, a daytime host, told The New York Times that when she complained to Mr. Shine about being harassed by Mr. Ailes, he told her, “Don’t fight this. ” Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Shine said that Ms. Tantaros never complained to him about Mr. Ailes harassing her. Laurie Luhn, a former Fox booker, told New York magazine that Mr. Ailes enlisted aides, including Mr. Shine, to recommend doctors and make travel arrangements for her while she was involved in a relationship with Mr. Ailes. Mr. Shine has told associates that he did not know that Mr. Ailes was in a relationship with Ms. Luhn. In a statement on Friday, Mr. Murdoch wrote: “Bill Shine has developed and produced a signature prime time that has dominated the cable news landscape for 14 of his 20 years with Fox News. His leadership and keen eye for programming has played a fundamental role in the success of both Fox News and Fox Business Network. ” Of Mr. Abernethy, who is 60, Mr. Murdoch wrote that his appointment “will ensure continued growth of Fox News and Fox Business Network for generations to come. ” Fox News also announced that Suzanne Scott had been named executive vice president of programming and would oversee the network’s daytime and   opinion shows. Jay Wallace will remain in charge of the news division. Ms. Scott and Mr. Wallace will report to Mr. Shine. Dianne Brandi, the general counsel, is expected to stay on as well."

B. A. finals game in 18 years. The matchup was rich with story lines: LeBron James’s bid to win the first championship for a Cleveland sports franchise in 52 years versus Golden State’s march toward one of the best seasons in National Basketball Association history.

Portugal loses first qualifier after Euro ’16," (CNN) Portugal always manages to land at European Championships and World Cups, and won Euro 2016 in France in July.  That’s not to say qualifying is always easy    Portugal has a history of needing the playoffs to lock down a spot    and if Tuesday is any indication, it could be another bumpy ride for the national team.  Without multiple Ballon d’Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who is still nursing the knee injury he picked up in the Euro 2016 final against France, Portugal fell   to Switzerland to begin its Group B qualifying campaign for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.  The Swiss realistically secured all three points after half an hour. Breel Embolo scored on a rebound in the 23rd minute and Admir Mehmedi doubled the advantage with a fine finish in the 30th minute in Basel.  Switzerland had midfielder Granit Xhaka sent off for picking up two yellow cards but by that time    injury time in the second half    it was too late for Portugal to think of a comeback.  Portugal had warmed up for the game by routing Gibraltar   in a friendly last week. "
UK woman arrested in Dubai after reporting rape," (CNN) A British tourist has been arrested in Dubai on charges of extramarital sex after telling police a group of British nationals raped her in the United Arab Emirates, according to a   legal advice group called Detained in Dubai. ”This is tremendously disturbing,” Radha Stirling, the group’s founder and director, said in a statement. ”Police regularly fail to differentiate between consensual intercourse and violent rape.  ”Victims go to them expecting justice, and end up being prosecuted. They not only invalidate their (victimization) they actually punish them for it.” A UK Foreign Office spokeswoman said she could not discuss specific details, saying: ”We are supporting a British woman in relation to this case and will remain in contact with her family.” It is understood that the Foreign Office is also in contact with two other British nationals. The press office for the British Consulate in Dubai said it was supporting a British woman and her family, adding: ”We have raised the case with the UAE Government, and would like to see it progress as quickly as possible.”  Dubai is one of seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates, or UAE. According to Detained in Dubai, the woman was ” ” by the British nationals. Stirling said the woman had been released on bail but had had her passport confiscated. If convicted of consensual sex, the woman faces anywhere from a month to three years behind bars, followed by deportation, according to Faisal Alzarooni, a criminal defense lawyer who represents clients who’ve been charged with both rape and consensual sex in Dubai. ”The police or prosecution may have traces, but not necessarily evidence, that it was consensual sex. For example, if the rape was in a hotel room, if they saw on CCTV cameras that they (the accuser and the alleged attackers) walked together out of the room, they might think this is not rape in this case,” Alzarooni said. The Government of Dubai Media Office told CNN on Saturday it had no comment on the case.  A spokesman for Dubai police said he was unable to comment because the case was before the courts."
Flight 93 National Memorial Fast Facts," (CNN) Here’s a look at the Flight 93 National Memorial. It is a memorial to the 40 passengers and crew who died on United Flight 93 on September 11, 2001 near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.  Facts:When complete, the memorial will encompass 2, 200 acres. It is managed by the National Park Service. One of the remaining features of the memorial is the ”Tower of Voices,” a    tower with 40 wind chimes, which is planned for completion in 2017.  The memorial has received an average of about 300, 000 visitors a year since the first features of the memorial were dedicated in 2011. Upon completion, features of the memorial will include the Sacred Ground memorial plaza, the ”Tower of Voices,” 40 memorial groves and a field of honor.  The design was modified in 2005 after some people complained that it contained ”Islamic symbolism.” The National Park Service addressed concerns.  Timeline:September 11, 2001   United Airlines Flight 93, traveling from Newark, New Jersey, to San Francisco, crashes in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Hijackers were directing the plane towards an unknown location, but were disrupted by passengers. All 40 passengers and crew and four hijackers are killed. September 24, 2002   The Flight 93 National Memorial Act is passed, creating the country’s 386th national park.  September 7, 2005   A design by Paul Murdoch Architects of Los Angeles, ”The Crescent of Embrace,” is chosen for the memorial. A committee of 15 people, including family members of victims, chooses it out of more than 1, 000 entries.  August 31, 2009   Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announces the National Park Service has reached agreements with seven of eight landowners to purchase the land necessary for the memorial, at an estimated $9. 5 million. The eighth parcel, owned by Svonavec, Inc. will be taken by eminent domain after an agreement cannot be reached. This parcel includes most of the crash site.  November 7, 2009   The groundbreaking ceremony at the memorial site takes place.  August 4, 2011   The National Park Foundation announces it will match up to $2 million in donations.  September 10, 2011   The first features of the Flight 93 National Memorial are dedicated and opened to the public. Vice President Joe Biden attends the ceremony.

October 3, 2014   A fire breaks out at the memorial, destroying the headquarters complex. Although most of the 60, 000 tribute items are stored   important items, including the flag that flew over the US Capitol on September 11, 2001, are destroyed. No initial cause of the fire has been determined, but arson and foul play have been ruled out. February 6, 2016   The National Park Service releases a report with the findings of its investigation into the blaze. Improperly discarded smoking material (possibly a cigarette) landscaping mulch too close to the building and flammable decking material may have fueled the fire but investigators were unable to determine exactly how the blaze started. More than 300 photographs and 25 personal mementos were lost in the fire.  "
The US has been downgraded to a ’flawed democracy’,"’  ’ ’   The US has been downgraded to a ”flawed democracy” from a ”full   democracy” by the Economist Intelligence Unit in its 2016   ”Democracy Index” report. ’ ”   Although the report’s publication comes shortly after the   election of President Donald Trump, the EIU analysts   write that the US was not downgraded because of him. Rather,   his surprise election was an effect of the underlying   causes that led the EIU to downgrade the US. ” ’   According to the EIU, ”full   democracies” are countries in which basic political   freedoms and civil liberties are respected, and are ”underpinned   by a political culture conducive to the flourishing of   democracy.” The government functions satisfactorily; media   are independent and diverse; the judiciary is independent   and their decisions are enforced; and there’’s an effective system   of checks and balances. ’ ’   Meanwhile, ”flawed democracies” have free and   fair elections (with possibly some issues such as infringements   on media freedom) and respect basic civil liberties. However,   there are governance problems and low levels of political   participation. ’ ’   The US’’s overall ”Democracy Index” score fell from 8. 05 in 2015     —   just below the EIU’’s threshold of   8. 00 for a ”full democracy.” The analysts write that a key   factor in the drop was Americans’’ growing distrust in   governmental institutions. ’ ’   ”Popular trust in government, elected representatives, and   political parties has fallen to extremely low levels in the US.   This has been a   trend and one that preceded the   election of Mr. Trump as the US president in November 2016,” they   write. ’ ’  ’ ’   ”By tapping a deep strain of political disaffection with the   functioning of democracy, Mr. Trump became a beneficiary of the   low esteem in which US voters hold their government, elected   representatives, and political parties, but he was not   responsible for a problem that has had a long gestation.” ’ ”   Notably, they write that even if 2016 weren’t an   election year, the US’s score would’ve dipped below 8. 00. ” ’  ’ ’   As a reference point, other countries that qualify as ”flawed   democracies” and have similar scores on the EIU metrics   as the US include Japan, Italy, France, South Korea, Israel,   Estonia, India, and Chile. ’ ’  ’ ’   Americans’’ trust in government has been declining since the late   1950s. And after an uptick from the   to the early   2000s, confidence again dropped, according to  cited by the EIU. In fact, the percentage   of Americans who say they trust the government ”just about   always” or ”most of the time” dropped to less than 20% in   the  . ’ ”   The EIU argues that there are several reasons for this decline.   First, major political events over the past several decades,   including the Vietnam War, the Watergate scandal, the Iraq War,   the financial and housing crisis in   and government   shutdowns, have eroded Americans’ trust in government. ” ’   Additionally, the EIU argues that rising income inequality has   been an underlying factor in growing distrust. ’ ’  ’ ’   On that note, a few months back  ’ ’  ’ ” In August, Goldman Sachs’ Sumana   Manohar and Hugo    comparing a given country’s gross domestic   product per capita to its Gini coefficient. ” ’  ’ ”   The  is a measurement of the income distribution   within a country that aims to show the gap between the rich and   the poor. The number ranges from zero to one, with zero   representing perfect equality (everyone has the same income) and   one representing perfect inequality (one person earns the entire   country’s income and everyone else has nothing.) A higher Gini   coefficient means greater inequality. ” ’   Developed market economies such as those in Germany, France, and   Sweden tend to have a higher GDP per capita and lower Gini   coefficients. On the flip side, emerging market economies in   countries like Russia, Brazil, and South Africa tend to have a   lower GDP per capita but a higher Gini coefficient. ’ ”   However, the US’s GDP per capita is on par with developed   European countries like Switzerland and Norway, but its Gini   coefficient is in the same tier as Russia’s and China’s. ” ’   ”If income inequality has exacerbated American trust in   government and public institutions, continued economic progress   should start to reverse this trend in the coming years,” they   wrote. ”The   is at its highest level since the   financial crisis, and income inequality should gradually narrow   if the economic recovery continues.” ’ ’   But the US is not the sole country to have a decline in   confidence in political elites and institutions; major European   economies have also seen this trend. In June,  while    across the   continent. ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   That being said, unlike for the US,   UK is still a   ”full democracy” and its score increased  —   to   8. 36 in 2016 from the prior year’’s reading of 8. 31  —     because of increased political participation with the Brexit   vote. ’ ’   The referendum drew a turnout of 72. 2% compared with average   turnouts of 63% in the four general elections since   2001.  ’ ’  ’ ’  ’"

Evian Championship: In-Gee Chun leads going into final round," (CNN)  Chun shot a near faultless    65 to extend her lead going into the final round of the Evian Championship. A double bogey on the ninth was the only blemish on Chun’s otherwise perfect scorecard Saturday, and the    now has her eye on the   lowest score recorded at a women’s major. She is chasing the    total shot by Karen Stupples at the 2004 British Open, which was matched by Inbee Park at the PGA Championship in 2015. ”It’s a really big honor for me,” Chun said of equaling the feat. ”But I just have to stick with my game plan. ”The game plan for tomorrow is just to keep doing the same thing.  ”I’m not going to think about winning. I just want to keep enjoying what I am doing.” Fellow South Korean Sung Hyun Park was four shots back on 15 under par, but was still confident of closing the gap. Her last professional win, which came on the Korean Tour, was also from four shots behind. ”I know I need to shoot low tomorrow,” she told reporters after her round. ”I have known   since we were at elementary school. We are good friends.” This is Chun’s first year on LPGA Tour and she is aiming to become only the second woman in history to win her first two LPGA titles at major championships, following in the footsteps of compatriot Se Ri Pak. Chun’s first major victory came in last year’s US Open, although she failed to make the cut in the defense of her title in July. Chinese golfer, and bronze medalist from Rio 2016, Shanshan Feng was a further two shots back and alone in third place. Reigning champion Lydia Ko had an afternoon to forget, with New Zealand’s world No. 1 shooting a   75 to be tied for 34th. "
Steve King’s Iowa Voters Rethink Their Support: ‘Way Out of Line’ - The New York Times,"ORANGE CITY, Iowa  —   A year ago, Evan Wielenga, 40, believed  —   as does his congressman, Steve King  —   that undocumented immigrants should all be deported. They broke the law to enter the country. They spoke little English. They strained schools and public services. But as talk of a border wall and a Muslim ban overtook the presidential campaign, Mr. Wielenga, the agronomy manager of a farmers’   here in northwestern Iowa, had a change of heart. He heard dairy farmers say they couldn’t get their cows milked without immigrants. “You can put an ad in the paper and you won’t get two white guys to apply,” said Mr. Wielenga, who grew up on a dairy farm himself. He heard of the ruinous damage an immigration raid had done to families. “Some of these kids were born in the U. S.,” he said. “These families had lived here 10 years, and all of a sudden, Dad’s gone, Mom’s gone. When you think of it from that perspective, what’s the lesser of two evils?” Mr. King, a Republican who has displayed a Confederate battle flag on his desk in Washington, shows no sign of budging in his views. His latest   tirade  —   “We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies,” he said  —   once again drew wide condemnation and critical attention to Iowa’s Fourth Congressional District, whose voters overwhelmingly   him to an eighth term in November. Sioux County, Mr. Wielenga’s home, provided the largest margin in the   district, Iowa’s most conservative. And there is no shortage of voters who echo Mr. King’s contention that “culture and demographics are our destiny,” as he said earlier this month to cheers from white supremacists. But in conversations over four days with residents who voted for Mr. King, a new chorus of earnest naysayers could also be heard in many corners of the district. Some said the congressman’s latest provocation  —   uttered in support of a   Dutch politician  —   was finally more than they could brook. Several said they were rethinking their support. “I’ve always voted for him, but I think this was way out of line,” said Bill Kooi, a retired farmer, sipping coffee at a Hardees in Orange City, as the friends who shared his table  —   to a man, older white conservatives  —   all nodded. Again and again, voters brought up how much Mr. King’s district has changed since his election 15 years ago. Though still overwhelmingly white, it has absorbed a sizable population of Hispanics who have taken    jobs and opened small businesses in the empty storefronts of struggling towns. As a generation of   white children leaves for college and seldom returns, immigrants are keeping many of those communities alive. Denison, in Crawford County, is one. Eric Skoog, a county commissioner and owner of Cronk’s restaurant in Denison, where Mr. King, 67, sometimes stops on his way home, said the community had been successfully assimilating a steady stream of Hispanics for years. “One of our claims to fame is we don’t have a Hispanic neighborhood,” Mr. Skoog said. Rather, immigrants and their families live throughout the community. Before the 2010 census, city officials worked hard to persuade immigrants to allow themselves to be counted so Denison could receive its share of federal dollars. Mr. Skoog said that Latino newcomers had flocked to Denison to take jobs in meatpacking plants that Iowa farmers had once filled  —   but that those native Iowans wanted better for their children. “The next generation, there was not a supply of male white farmers around here,” he said. “So all of a sudden you saw the influx of the Hispanic population. ” Mr. Skoog counts himself a friend of Mr. King’s, but offered no explanation for the lawmaker’s   and racially inflammatory statements, which go back years, including a 2013 description of undocumented teenagers with “calves the size of cantaloupes” from carrying drugs across the border. Selecting his words carefully, Mr. Skoog said of Mr. King: “There’s a personal relationship there. I don’t want to damage that by saying too much negative. ” Others describe an ethos that is changing day by day. Libbie Schillerberg has three children in the Denison schools, where more than half the students are Hispanic. Her oldest, Ethan, 15, plays guitar in a high school mariachi band. Her youngest, Addison, 6, is one of four   whites in her class. “I’m on our youth soccer board,” Ms. Schillerberg said. “We didn’t used to see as many Hispanic parents volunteering to coach. We’re seeing more and more. When your kids are such good friends at school, people are getting to know each other better. They’re trusting each other, wanting to be around each other. ” Mario Flores, a   loan officer at Bank Iowa in Denison, said Hispanics there were buying homes, investing in apartment buildings and otherwise injecting economic vitality into the community. “I believe both groups, the Anglo and   are learning from each other,” he said. Mr. King has survived past denunciations: Last year, he drew a rare primary challenger, who accused him of being so toxic that his name on a  bill rendered it “dead on arrival. ” But Mr. King won easily and went on to crush his Democratic opponent, Kim Weaver, an advocate for the elderly. Over the weekend, Ms. Weaver, who received a small gusher of donations after Mr. King’s latest remarks, announced she would challenge him again in 2018. It will not be easy. Last summer, Douglas Burns, an owner of The Times Herald in Carroll, Iowa, headlined a column: “King could use   daily, still get   here. ” Mr. Burns has branded Mr. King as a racist, but he recoiled from calling the district’s voters bigoted. Rather, he said in an interview, they embraced Mr. King for blackening the eyes of Washington and Des Moines elites. “I think people feel condescended to so much from urban forces that, while they may not like the racist tactics that King uses, if forced to choose sides, they’re going with King,” Mr. Burns said. But there are plenty who don’t seem to quibble much with Mr. King’s way of thinking. Sitting at the Hardees in Orange City last week, Don Engeltjes, 76, said he agreed with Mr. King on the need to clamp down on immigration. He said he believed new arrivals were a drain on taxpayers’ money, lumping immigrants from Mexico in with those from the Muslim world. “It’s just handout, handout, handout,” he said. “But Don, your dad is an immigrant too,” another man piped up, noting that Mr. Engeltjes’s father, like many forebears of the district’s voters, had come over from Holland at age 9. “You bet he was,” Mr. Engeltjes replied. “But the way it’s going nowadays, man, they’re outproducing us. We’re going to be the minority in a few years. ” Asked by a reporter who he meant by “we,” Mr. Engeltjes said: “The white people. The American people. ” Mr. Engeltjes said he did not oppose all immigrants. He described a successful prostate procedure he had not long ago in Sioux Falls, S. D. performed by a Korean doctor. But he complained that homes occupied by several Hispanic families living together were running down his neighborhood. On Sundays, he said, he picks up trash in the street from parties he believes are held by his Hispanic neighbors. Interviewed at his home later, where his wife, Alma, said her husband had occasionally made enemies by being outspoken, Mr. Engeltjes praised the same quality in Mr. King, for whom he said he would vote again. “Enough of this ” he said. “The man’s got a pair. ” Mr. Wielenga, the agronomist, suggested that northwestern Iowa, with its proud Dutch heritage, may have grown too insular, too complacent, during Mr. King’s tenure in Congress. He called it a safe community and a great place to raise children. He has four daughters and is the board president of Hull Christian School, where Mr. Wielenga said only one of the 100 families who send children to the private school is Hispanic. He said some of the area’s churches were entirely white. “We talk about this at school,” Mr. Wielenga said: “Are we living in a bubble? And is that what God is calling us to do  —   to live in a bubble?” “This has been going on now for 20 years,” he said of the Hispanic influx. “Now you want to fix it by kicking people out?” He gently shook his head."
"People From 7 Travel-Ban Nations Pose No Increased Terror Risk, Report Says - The New York Times","When President Trump signed an executive order last month temporarily barring visitors from seven mostly Muslim countries, he said he was moving to protect the United States from terrorist attacks. The Homeland Security secretary, John F. Kelly, echoed the president, saying the travel ban was necessary because vetting procedures “in those seven countries are suspect. ” But an internal report written by intelligence analysts at Mr. Kelly’s department appears to undercut the assessment that people from the seven countries  —   Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen  —   pose a heightened threat of terrorism. The   report found that “country of citizenship is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity. ” The report adds to the difficulties the Trump administration has faced in carrying out the travel ban. Federal judges have suspended the order, and the administration has said it will redo it to withstand legal scrutiny, but has not given a timetable. The Department of Homeland Security assessment, first reported by The Associated Press, found that only a small number of people from the seven countries had been involved in   activities in the United States since the Syrian civil war began in 2011. In addition, the report noted, while terrorist groups in Iraq, Syria and Yemen pose a threat to the United States, militant groups in the other four countries have a more regional focus. The report also found that in the past six years, the terrorism threat reached much more widely than the seven countries listed  —   individuals from 26 countries had been “inspired” to carry out attacks in the United States. Furthermore, few individuals from the seven countries affected by the ban have access to the United States, the report said, noting the small numbers of visas granted by the State Department to citizens of those nations. The White House and the Department of Homeland Security sought to play down the significance of the report. The White House said that it was politically motivated and disregarded information that would have provided support for the travel ban. The Department of Homeland Security said the report was just a draft and “not a final comprehensive review of the government’s intelligence. ” Stephen Miller, a senior aide to Mr. Trump, told Fox News on Tuesday that the redrawn executive order would “have the same basic policy outcome. ” The Trump administration on Friday also took the first steps toward following through on the president’s plan to build a wall along the border with Mexico. Customs and Border Protection, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, announced that it would begin accepting design proposals for a wall. The agency said it would need the proposals by March 10. After it chooses a list of potential vendors, full proposals would be required a few weeks later. The agency said it could make a final decision by the middle of April."
U.S. Accuses Russian-Backed Assad Regime of Striking Hospitals in Syria,"Airstrikes hit four hospitals and a school building in northern Syria Monday, killing at least 50 people, according to various media reports. [Eight others are missing and presumed dead. The   Syrian government forces have been accused of carrying out the airstrikes.  Citing an unnamed hospital worker on the scene, CNN reports that 15 people were killed and up to 40 others were injured, including women and children, when airstrikes struck the Women and Children’s Hospital and a school building that was housing displaced people in Azaz, located in Syria’s Aleppo province. Another medical facility located in Syria’s Idlib province, about 62 miles away from the Women and Children’s Hospital, was also stuck in a separate attack, adds CNN. “At least seven people were killed and eight are missing and presumed dead following a Monday morning attack in northern Syria that destroyed a hospital supported by Doctors Without   Sans Frontières (MSF),” reports the humanitarian organization. “The hospital in Ma’arat Al Numan, Idlib Province, was hit by four missiles in two attacks within a few minutes of each other, according to staff from the hospital,” it adds. “Five patients, one patient caretaker, and a hospital guard were killed. Eight staff members are missing and presumed dead. Other patients are still missing, but their numbers are currently unknown. ” Two other hospitals operated by the United Nations, for a total of four, were also bombed Monday, reports The New York Times.  “As always, caught in the middle are civilians, with four hospitals bombed in a single day on Monday and Turkey and the Syrian insurgents accusing Russia of targeting them deliberately to drive them out of the area, ” notes the report. “Two of the hospitals were supported by Unicef, including a pediatric and maternity hospital, and at least 50 people were killed in all of the attacks, including children, said Farhan Haq, a United Nations spokesman. ” The October 2015 U. S. bombing of a hospital in Afghanistan operated by Doctors Without Borders, known officially as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) sparked international outrage, prompting President Obama and the Pentagon to issue an apology for the mistaken attack that killed at least 30 people. U. S. Gen. John Campbell, the top commander of American and international troops in Afghanistan, said the bombing of the hospital was “the direct result of human error compounded by systems and procedural failures,” noting that military personnel who were closely involved in the bombing have been suspended. The United States, Turkey, Amnesty International, and Doctors Without Borders have accused Assad troops, backed by Russia, of carrying out the attacks. “The United States condemns airstrikes conducted in and around Aleppo today against innocent civilian targets, including a hospital run by Médecins Sans Frontières [MSF] and the Women’s and Children’s hospital in Azaz city,” declared the State Department in a statement. “That the Assad regime and its supporters would continue these attacks, without cause and without sufficient regard for international obligations to safeguard innocent lives, flies in the face of the unanimous calls by the [International Syria Support Group] ISSG, including in Munich, to avoid attacks on civilians and casts doubt on Russia’s willingness   ability to help bring to a stop the continued brutality of the Assad regime against its own people,” it adds. Echoing the State Department, Amnesty International called on Russian and Syrian forces to stop deliberate attacks on hospitals, clinics, and medical personnel. “Russian and Syrian forces know full well that deliberate attacks on medical facilities are war crimes. All parties to the conflict must cease such horrific attacks, stop destroying medical facilities and allow medical workers to carry out their   work without fear of being killed or injured in the line of duty,” Said Boumedouha, Deputy Middle East and North Africa Program Director at Amnesty International, said in a statement. MSF president Mego Terzian told Reuters “either the [Syrian] government or Russia” was responsible for carrying out the strikes that destroyed the MSF facility in Idlib province. Riad Haddad, Syria’s ambassador to Russia, accused the U. S.  coalition forces of the attack on the MSF facility in Idlib, an allegation that the Pentagon has denied. “The destruction of the   facility appears to be a deliberate attack on a health structure,” said Massimiliano Rebaudengo, MSF Head of Mission, adding, “The destruction of the hospital leaves the local population of around 40, 000 people without access to medical services in an active zone of conflict. ” Last September, Russia began launching airstrikes in support of the Assad regime’s offensive against rebels. “Speaking in Kiev, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu blamed Russia for the strikes in Azaz, which is close to the Turkish border, claiming Moscow had targeted the complex with ballistic missiles fired from the Caspian Sea,” reports CNN. CNN acknowledges that Moscow has not commented on the attacks."
Band Pulls Out of SXSW Show over ’Xenophobic’ Immigration Clause,"Politics and the Trump administration’s immigration policies have taken center stage at one of the music industry’s biggest events. [One band has pulled out of a South by Southwest (SXSW) showcase, claiming that the annual film, media, and music festival’s performer contract says international artists may be reported to immigration officials.  Felix Walworth, a member of New   band Told Slant, posted a photo of what he says is the SXSW performer contract that warns that international artists who perform unofficial concerts during the week of the festival could be handed over to U. S. government immigration officials and deported. SXSW will “notify the appropriate U. S. immigration authorities” of artists who “adversely affect the viability of their official SXSW showcase,” the contract states: After looking through this contract sent to me by sxsw I have decided to cancel Told Slant’s performance at the festival pic. twitter.   —   Told Slant (@Felixixix666) March 2, 2017,  SXSW’s managing director, Roland Swenson, said the clause has been part of the SXSW contract since 2013 and is only enforced “if somebody did something really horrific, like disobey rules about pyrotechnics, starting a brawl, or if they killed somebody. ” In a statement published by A. V. Club, Swenson said, “We understand that given the current political climate surrounding immigration, the language that was published seems strong. Violating U. S. immigration law has always carried potentially severe consequences, and we would be remiss not to warn our participating acts of the likely repercussions. ” But more artists signed an open letter demanding SXSW organizers strip the immigration language from the performer contract and make it clear that SXSW is “a welcoming space for all artists, including immigrants and international performers. ” SXSW organizers now say they will review and amend the immigration clause in time for the 2018 festival, according to a statement published in Stereogum. However, more bands and artists have slammed the SXSW organizer’s new proposal, calling it “xenophobic” and “utterly misleading” in a statement published by Rolling Stone. This is a developing story. The SXSW showcase is currently scheduled for March 17 at the Palm Door in Austin, Texas. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson."
"Leon Russell, Hit Maker and Musicians’ Musician, Dies at 74 - The New York Times","Leon Russell, the longhaired,   pianist, guitarist, songwriter and bandleader who moved from playing countless recording sessions to making hits on his own, died on Sunday in Nashville. He was 74. His website said he had died in his sleep but gave no specific cause. Mr. Russell’s health had incurred significant setbacks in recent years. In 2010, he underwent surgery for a brain fluid leak and was treated for heart failure. In July he had a heart attack and was scheduled for further surgery, according to a news release from the historical society of Oklahoma, his home state. With his trademark top hat, hair well past his shoulders, a long, lush beard, an Oklahoma drawl and his fingers splashing   barrelhouse piano chords, Mr. Russell cut a flamboyant figure in the early 1970s. He led Joe Cocker’s band Mad Dogs  Englishmen, appeared at George Harrison’s 1971 Concert for Bangladesh in New York City and had numerous hits of his own, including “Tight Rope. ” Many of his songs became hits for others, among them “Superstar” (written with Bonnie Bramlett) for the Carpenters, “Delta Lady” for Mr. Cocker and “This Masquerade” for George Benson. More than 100 acts have recorded “A Song for You,” which Mr. Russell said he wrote in 10 minutes. By the time he released his first solo album, in 1970, he had already played on hundreds of songs as one of the top studio musicians in Los Angeles. He was in Phil Spector’s Wall of Sound Orchestra, and he played sessions for Frank Sinatra, Sam Cooke, Aretha Franklin, the Ventures and the Monkees, among many others. His piano playing is heard on “Mr. Tambourine Man” by the Byrds, “A Taste of Honey” by Herb Alpert, “Live With Me” by the Rolling Stones and all of the Beach Boys’ early albums, including “Pet Sounds. ” The music Mr. Russell made on his own put a scruffy, casual surface on rich musical hybrids, interweaving soul, country, blues, jazz, gospel, pop and classical music. Like Willie Nelson, who collaborated with him, and Ray Charles, whose 1993 recording of “A Song for You” won a Grammy Award, Mr. Russell made a broad, sophisticated palette of American music sound   and natural. After his popularity had peaked in the 1970s, he shied away from   and largely set aside rock, though he kept performing. But he was prized as a musicians’ musician, collaborating with Elvis Costello and Elton John, among others. In 2011, after making a duet album with Mr. John, “The Union,” he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. At the ceremony, Mr. John called him “the master of space and time” and added, “He sang, he wrote and he played just how I wanted to do it. ” Leon Russell was born Claude Russell Bridges in Lawton, Okla. on April 2, 1942. An injury to his upper vertebrae at birth caused a slight paralysis on his right side that would shape his music: A resulting delayed reaction time in his right hand forced him to think ahead about what it would play. “It gave me a very strong sense of duality,” he said last year in a Public Radio International interview. He started classical piano lessons when he was 4, played baritone horn in his high school marching band and also learned trumpet. At 14 he started gigging in Oklahoma since it was a dry state at the time, he could play clubs without being old enough to drink. Soon after he graduated from high school, Jerry Lee Lewis hired him and his band to back him on tour for two months. He moved to Los Angeles in the late 1950s and found club work and then studio work he learned to play guitar, and he began calling himself Leon Russell, taking the name Leon from a friend who had lent him an ID so he could play California club dates while underage. His   drew on both his classical training and his Southern roots, and he played everything from standards to   from   to pop throwaways. He was glimpsed on television as a member of the Shindogs, the house band for the   rock show “Shindig!” in the   and was in the house band for the 1964 concert film, “The T. A. M. I. Show. ” In 1967, he built a home studio and began working with the guitarist Marc Benno as the Asylum Choir, which released its debut album in 1968. He also started a record label, Shelter, in 1969 with the producer Denny Cordell. Mr. Russell drew more recognition as a   arranger and musician on Mr. Cocker’s second album, “Joe Cocker! ,” which included Mr. Russell’s song “Delta Lady. ” When Mr. Cocker’s Grease Band fell apart days before an American tour, Mr. Russell assembled Mad Dogs  Englishmen, a big, boisterous band that included three drummers and a   choir. Its 1970 double live album and a tour film became a showcase for Mr. Russell as well as for Mr. Cocker the album reached No. 2 on the Billboard album chart. Mr. Russell also released his first solo album in 1970 it included “A Song for You” and had studio appearances from Mr. Cocker, Eric Clapton, two members of the Beatles and three from the Rolling Stones. But Mr. Russell’s second album, “Leon Russell and the Shelter People,” fared better commercially: It reached No. 17 on the Billboard chart. Mr. Russell had his widest visibility as the 1970s began. He played the Concert for Bangladesh at Madison Square Garden with Mr. Harrison, Bob Dylan and Mr. Clapton he produced and played on Mr. Dylan’s songs “When I Paint My Masterpiece” and “Watching the River Flow. ” He toured with the Rolling Stones and with his own band. His third album, “Carney,” went to No. 2 with the hit “Tight Rope” it also featured his own version of “This Masquerade. ” In 1973, his “Leon Live” album reached the Top 10, and he recorded his first album of country songs under the pseudonym Hank Wilson. The fledgling Gap Band, also from Oklahoma, backed Mr. Russell in 1974 on his album “Stop All That Jazz. ” His 1975 album “Will o’ the Wisp” included what would be his last Top 20 pop hit, “Lady Blue. ” But he continued to work. He made duet albums with his wife at the time, Mary Russell (formerly Mary McCreary). And he collaborated with Mr. Nelson in 1979 on “One for the Road,” a double LP of pop and country standards. It sold half a million copies. That same year he married Janet Lee Constantine, who survives him, as do six children: Blue, Teddy Jack, Tina Rose, Sugaree, Honey and Coco. Mr. Russell delved into various idioms over the next decades, mostly recording for independent labels. He toured and recorded with the New Grass Revival, adding his piano and voice to their   lineup. He made more country albums as Hank Wilson. He recorded blues, Christmas songs, gospel songs and instrumentals. In 1992, the songwriter and pianist Bruce Hornsby, who had long cited Mr. Russell’s influence, sought to rejuvenate Mr. Russell’s rock career by producing the album “Anything Can Happen,” but it drew little notice. Mr. Russell continued to tour for   fans, who called themselves Leon Lifers. A call in 2009 from Mr. John, whom Mr. Russell had supported in the early 1970s, led to the making of “The Union”  —   which also had guest appearances by Neil Young and Brian Wilson  —   and a   tour together in 2010. Mr. Russell also sat in on Mr. Costello’s 2010 album, “National Ransom. ” Then he bought a new bus and returned to the road, on his own."
Democrats Facing Elections Refusing to Hold Town Hall Meetings,"As the media focuses on a handful of contentious town hall meetings held by Republican senators, several Democrats who face   campaigns this year have quietly decided to skip town halls to meet their constituents. [With the Republican Party in the majority, Senate Democrats are keeping a low profile in the hopes of giving voters fewer reasons to vote against them, the Associated Press reports.  The AP notes, “The nation’s most vulnerable Senate Democrats are avoiding town hall meetings as their Republican counterparts get pummeled by an energized electorate frustrated with President Donald Trump’s early agenda. ” Missouri’s Democrat Senator Claire McCaskill, for instance, has rebuffed offers to hold a town hall in a state that went for Donald Trump by 18 points last year. “Seems to me that all these members of Congress are afraid to face their constituents,” Hillary Shields, a member of Kansas City Indivisible, said after the senator turned down its invitation. West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin has also decided to bag a town hall event for his voters. Manchin has been one of the leading Democrats to give Trump and Republicans some measure of support, and it is not too surprising to see Manchin throwing in with Republicans on some issues. After all, West Virginia voted Trump with a lopsided 68. 7 percent to Hillary Clinton’s low 26. 5 percent. But Manchin clearly understands that he is vulnerable to being challenged by a Republican in a state turning red. As to others, the AP noted that Ohio’s Sherrod Brown has only held phone conference calls that do not lend themselves to mass protests. Also, Pennsylvania’s Bob Casey promised to hold a town hall but has not scheduled any yet, and Montana Senator Jon Tester’s office noted he has already held several appearances, though none of them were town   events. Democrats are forewarned, though, especially after the hostile crowd Arkansas’ Republican Senator Tom Cotton faced this week, Senator Cotton was barely allowed to get a word in edgewise as   liberal protesters screamed at him, chanted at him, and berated him for the Trump administration’s agenda.

How Trump can prep for the debate and win," (CNN) The upcoming debates are Donald Trump’s best (and likely last) chance to influence the course of this year’s presidential election.  The three general election debates planned over the next two months are crucial    particularly for the candidate who is behind    because they give voters a chance to see both candidates in their own words, free from the influence of scripted television ads or staged campaign events. A strong performance by the underdog, such as Mitt Romney’s showing in the first debate against President Barack Obama in 2012, can force voters to take a second look at a candidate they may have written off and make the fall campaign competitive once more. Because these debates have potential to impact the race, observers are rightfully curious about what Trump has done to prepare for them. After all, a disciplined and targeted debate prep process helped Romney win the first matchup four years ago, and could do the same for Trump.  Unfortunately, ”disciplined” and ”targeted” aren’t words that have often been used to describe Trump or his campaign to date. If he wants the campaign to be competitive, Trump doesn’t need to match Hillary Clinton word for word and policy for policy in the upcoming debates. But there are a few goals he should focus his preparation on: 1.  Advancing the overarching strategic narrative of Clinton as untrustworthy and   . Trump should understand that general election debates are, above all, an opportunity to draw an unflattering frame around your opponent. Each statement during the debate, as well as every exchange, should be focused on advancing the campaign’s strongest argument against Clinton. For Trump, the strategic frame is fairly obvious: Clinton cannot be trusted and doesn’t understand the needs of Americans across the country. To be successful, Trump should try to turn every answer and exchange during the debate back to this basic premise.   2. Understanding the Clinton record and highlighting just the facts. Clinton’s long record in the public spotlight may seem like an advantage, but Trump has to be prepared to exploit his opponent’s soft spots in a way that is both accurate and terse. Trump needs to spend his prep time familiarizing himself with the points that substantiate his characterization of ”crooked Hillary.” Knowing her record is key because there is plenty of ammunition Trump can use to make his point. He could, for example, point to Clinton’s now discredited assertion that she did not disseminate classified information through her private email address. The trick for him will be to avoid conspiracy theories (such as those about Clinton’s health) or outright false statements. Clearly, Trump has lacked this kind of discipline to date. But such unforced errors during the debate will only give Clinton the ability to discredit him or muddy the waters regarding who is more trustworthy. 3. Demonstrating that he has policy solutions to address the problems Americans care about. No one expects Trump to become a wonk overnight, and the appeal of his candidacy to date has had little to do with his expertise on matters of policy.  But the general election debates demand that a candidate possess an understanding of the policy challenges facing America and an ability to articulate solutions addressing them. A    debate over the course of 90 minutes will, at some point, require Trump to engage on matters of policy. He doesn’t need to be the world’s foremost expert on any policy area, but he should be able to show Americans he has a plan and demonstrate that his plan will improve their lives. This is particularly the case with respect to economic policy. Trump’s business background will be perceived by some voters as an advantage, while the economic anxiety being felt by many across the country places Clinton, as someone likely to continue Obama’s economic policies, at a disadvantage.  4. Arguing why Clinton’s solutions won’t work. Just as Trump needs to be familiar with his own plans, so, too, would he benefit from some familiarity with what Clinton’s policy proposals are. Here, again, Trump doesn’t need to understand chapter and verse about what Clinton is proposing. He just needs to be able to argue why her policies would result in damage to the American economy or America’s standing in the world. That also means characterizing them in a way that forces Clinton to play defense in areas where she has experience and is supposed to be strong, such as on foreign policy or health care.  5. Showing he has the temperament to be president. This is the toughest of the goals to prepare for, and arguably one that Trump simply cannot achieve. A recent survey conducted by Quinnipiac University found that 71% of likely voters do not believe he is ”level headed.”  In contrast, 62% of likely voters believe Clinton is.  That encapsulates the challenge for Trump.  During the first debate, in particular, Clinton will try to get under his skin and definitively demonstrate that he lacks the temperament and judgment to be president. Trump’s significant task is to weather the storm and make Americans believe he can be a commander in chief who won’t always be losing his cool. With the first debate less than a month away, Trump has a lot of prep to do if he wants to be successful. And there’s good reason to be skeptical that this work will actually get done. But the good news for Trump and his campaign is that a strong debate performance can help the public  envision him as presidential material and perhaps even make this election competitive again.    "
Brussels Fears EU Will Not Survive a Marine Le Pen Victory in France,"Top eurocrats fear that should Marine Le Pen win the French presidency, the European Union will not survive. [“From the [European] Commission’s point of view, success for Marine Le Pen is a disaster and an existential threat to the European project,” a top official from the bloc’s unelected executive told Politico. “We can survive a Brexit, but not a Frexit. ”  Ms. Le Pen has stopped short of openly endorsing French withdrawal from the EU but has pledged a “France First” economic policy should she win office, levying taxes on companies which move jobs out of the country and reintroducing the French franc alongside the     euro currency  —   policies which would fall foul of EU law. The economic patriotism which I advocate is impossible within the European Union ! https:  .   —   Marine in English (@Marine2017_EN) March 6, 2017, Following mass casualty terror attacks in Paris, Nice, and elsewhere in France, Ms. Le Pen also pledged to take France out of the EU’s   Schengen area, which former Interpol chief Robert Nobel has described as “an international   zone for terrorists”.

Donald Trump Keeps Distance in G.O.P. Platform Fight on Gay Rights - The New York Times,"CLEVELAND  —     marriage and transgender rights are emerging as points of serious strain between social conservatives and moderates who are trying to shape the Republican platform, reviving a festering cultural dispute as thousands of party activists and delegates prepare for their convention. Caught in the middle is Donald J. Trump, who claims “tremendous support, tremendous friendship” from gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people, and has gone further than most party figures to embrace them. Gays, in fact, are one of the few minority groups Mr. Trump has not singled out for criticism. But as the presumptive Republican nominee, he is also trying to assuage doubts about the convictions of his conservatism. The uncomfortable dynamic Mr. Trump has created for himself is perhaps best illustrated by his own calendar. He huddled last month at a Manhattan hotel with hundreds of religious conservatives, many of them  —   like James C. Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family, and Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council  —   outspoken opponents of new legal protections for gay and transgender people. A few days later, he took what an aide described as a friendly and supportive call from Caitlyn Jenner, the former Olympic decathlete who came out as transgender last year. One of the most contentious issues confronting delegates when they meet on Monday to debate the platform will be whether to adopt a provision defending state laws that try to prevent transgender people from using the public restroom of their choice. At times Mr. Trump has criticized those laws. And he has said Ms. Jenner can use whatever bathroom she prefers at his properties. But he has also promised not to interfere with the platform, which serves as the party’s official declaration of principles. Even as Mr. Trump keeps his distance from the debate, other Republicans who share his more accepting view of gay and transgender issues are working aggressively to tone down some of the platform’s language. The existing platform, adopted in 2012, is replete with disapproval of homosexuality. It calls court decisions favoring   marriage “an assault on the foundations of our society” and accuses the Obama administration of trying to impose “the homosexual rights agenda” on foreign countries. Paul E. Singer, a billionaire Republican who has financed gay rights battles across the country, is now funding an effort to write into the platform language more inclusive of gays, lesbians and transgender people. The goal of his group, the American Unity Fund, is not to get the party to endorse   marriage but to add a more   statement that commits the party “to respect for all families,” though there is still fierce resistance from the right. “We don’t have to say we’re tolerant because we are tolerant of other views,” said James Bopp Jr. a member of the platform committee from Indiana who has long supported efforts to make the platform more strongly in favor of traditional marriage. Such language promoting tolerance, he added, would be “redundant and superfluous. ” Advisers for the American Unity Fund, who say they know they are fighting a steep uphill battle, argue that the Republican Party can no longer afford to alienate people on gay rights issues. “We’ve got to make room for people with diverse views on civil marriage,” said Tyler Deaton, the group’s senior adviser. “This platform doesn’t even make room for people who support civil unions or domestic partnerships or people who support basic legal equality. ” Both parties adopt new platforms at their conventions every four years. A draft of the 2016 version has been put together over the last several weeks by the Republican National Committee, with help from conservative activists. Members of the platform committee received the draft on Sunday evening and will add or change certain provisions over the next two days. The draft circulating Sunday night condemned the Obama administration’s effort to deny funding to states that prohibit transgender people from using the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity, accusing the administration of trying to impose a cultural revolution. “They are determined to reshape our schools  —   and our entire society  —   to fit the mold of an ideology alien to America’s history,” the draft reads. Another section criticizes those who boycott businesses that deny services to   couples. Though he will almost certainly not mention it when he accepts the nomination next week, Mr. Trump’s actions and words on gay rights have been more supportive than those of any Republican presidential nominee, even if they fall short of the full social and legal acceptance that his expected opponent, Hillary Clinton, has promoted. He has boasted of his friendships with many gay people, saying “I have so many fabulous friends who happen to be gay. ” He has supported AIDS charities for years, and welcomed gay couples at his Palm Beach club when doing so was considered remarkable. And he has recently started insisting that he would be a better friend to the gay community than Mrs. Clinton, even though he opposes legal rights like marriage. But as he tries to convince social conservatives that he is not acting as a moderate, Mr. Trump has been largely   with the platform. “His guys have not shown up and said, ‘Change this, change that,’” David Barton, a platform committee member from Texas, said. The Republican platform committee has long been dominated by some of the party’s most stalwart activists. And some of them have hardly been shy about their views. There is Cynthia Dunbar of Virginia, who has compared the gay rights movement to Nazism. Hardy Billington, a committee member from Missouri,  placed an ad in a local paper asserting that homosexuality kills people at two to three times the rate of smoking. And Mary Frances Forrester of North Carolina has claimed that the “homosexual agenda is trying to change the course of Western civilization. ” Mr. Bopp of Indiana recently wrote to delegates to say that the Republican Party has always opposed threats to traditional marriage “beginning with our opposition to the ‘twin relics of barbarism’ of slavery and polygamy in our 1856 platform. ” As dominant as those conservative voices have been, delegates who want to see a more inclusive platform are gaining seats on the committee. Many of them believe the Republican Party needs to have a serious debate this year about whittling down a platform that has grown long and become riddled with   additions. Boyd Matheson, a   platform committee member from Utah, noted that at 33, 000 words, the 2012 platform was “six or seven times longer than the Constitution. ” Recent platforms have become, he said, “these laundry lists and litmus tests of ‘thou shalts’ and ‘thou shalt nots. ’” The party’s first platform in 1856 was fewer than 1, 000 words. As an alternative this year, Mr. Matheson proposed a   document that he said adheres to the founding principles of the party, like equal rights and economic opportunity. It contains no mention of   marriage or transgender issues. “That does not elevate the discussion we need,” Mr. Matheson said. It is not the discussion Mr. Trump is eager to have, either. Asked in a recent interview about the platform, he declined to comment, saying only that he was “looking at it. ” But as a reminder of how unorthodox a Republican Mr. Trump is  —   and of how contrary many of his views on issues like trade, foreign policy, eminent domain and gay rights are to the party’s doctrine  —   there is no more vivid example than the platform. “The bigger problem for Trump and the Republican National Committee,” said Lanhee J. Chen, who led Mitt Romney’s platform efforts in 2012, “is the fact that there are these major disagreements between where Trump is on some of these issues and where the activist base of the party is. ” Differences between a candidate’s views and what is written in the platform are nothing new, of course. Bob Dole admitted he had not read the entire document when he was the Republican nominee in 1996. And he publicly repudiated parts of it that called for a constitutional amendment to deny automatic citizenship for children born to illegal immigrants. It is not clear Mr. Trump would ever go that far, given how little attention he has paid to the party’s traditions and sacraments. “I don’t know if Trump really cares,” Mr. Chen added."
Senate blocks measures to extend NSA,"Washington (CNN) Opponents of the National Security Agency’s bulk collection of telephone data successfully blocked multiple attempts in the Senate early Saturday morning to extend the expiring law that authorizes the program. The developments, coming in a rare overnight session, leave in doubt the ability of Congress to keep alive the Patriot Act program that many feel is critical to national security but has also alarmed privacy advocates for its sweeping nature. First, the Senate blocked two separate measures. The first, a   bill that would shift responsibility for holding data from the government to telecommunications companies, while also imposing stricter limitations on how authorities could access the information, failed in a   vote. The second measure was a   extension beyond the current law’s June 1 expiration date, which was voted down  . RELATED: Everything you need to know about the Patriot Act debate, Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who’s also seeking his party’s nomination for President, led the charge against the program, repeatedly objecting to requests from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to extend it by just a few days.  ”We have entered into a momentous debate,” said Paul, who said he objected because his request for a guarantee of two amendments on a future bill dealing with the NSA program was denied. ”This is a debate about whether a warrant with a single name of a single company can be used to collect all of the phone records of all of the people in our country with a single warrant. Our forefathers would be aghast.” Later, standing on the floor in the hushed chamber, McConnell made repeated attempts to keep the law alive. The first was to extend the NSA’s authority to June 8, which was objected to by Paul. McConnell’s next attempt was to extend to June 5, which was objected to by Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, an ally of Paul on the issue. An attempt by McConnell at a June 3 deadline was denied by Sen. Martin Heinrich,   Mexico. Finally, McConnell requested the program be extended until June 2, just one day after the law is set to expire, and Paul objected again. Senators, who throughout the week generally thought a   extension would eventually be approved, appeared stunned by the swift  exchanges between McConnell and the three opponents of the program. Gasps were audible. An exasperated McConnell then took off his microphone and huddled with his leadership colleagues, searching for what to do next. After a few minutes, he returned to the podium and announced the Senate would adjourn and return to work a week from Sunday and try to find a way to keep the law in existence.  ”We’ll be back on Sunday, May 31, one more opportunity to act responsibly to not allow this program to expire,” he said around 1:30 a. m. ”This is a   period. We know what’s going on overseas. We know what’s been tried here at home. My colleagues, do we really want this law to expire?” By the time McConnell spoke, the visitors’ gallery was largely empty. But a small group of people, wearing   ”Stand with Rand”   remained. McConnell wasn’t the only senator who was frustrated with Paul’s tactics. Some senators privately grumbled about having to stay late as the Memorial Day weekend got underway, and Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill tweeted that the Kentucky senator was using the moment to ”grandstand.” Later Saturday morning, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a likely presidential candidate and a former U. S. attorney, blasted the Senate’s votes, and indirectly referenced Paul in his criticism. ”The Senate’s failure to extend the Patriot Act is a failure of the U. S. government to perform its most important function: protecting its citizens from harm,” Christie said. ”This is the unfortunate result of misguided ideologues who have no real world experience in fighting terrorism putting their uninformed beliefs above the safety and security of our citizens. This dysfunction is what we have come to expect from Washington, D. C. but usually it does not have such dangerous and severe consequences.” But in a fundraising email sent out Saturday morning    entitled ”Last night I put NSA spying on life support”    the Kentucky senator trumpeted his actions. ”Fellow conservative,” Paul said in the email, ”I stood up to the surveillance state every step of way.” President Barack Obama has advocated for a renewal of the program, and an administration official told CNN Saturday that the White House’s outreach to the Senate extended ”well into the night.” But with no agreement reached, the NSA is beginning to ”wind down” the bulk collection program to comply in time with the June 1 sunset date, the official said. ”We have long made known that we would not seek to continue the program if the authorities expire,” the official added."
5 questions for my son’s abductor," (CNN) October 22 will mark 25 years since my son Jacob was taken from his family as he rode his bike home with his brother and a friend on a rural Minnesota road.   Jacob was a fun, active, athletic, kind,    boy who loved peanut butter and football.  He was most known for his sense of fairness. Not knowing what happened or who abducted Jacob has left so many unanswered questions for Jacob’s father, sisters, brother and me.   If I had the chance to talk face to face with the man who took my son away, here’s what I’d want to know: Who are you?   I believe that somebody knows. It’s time to quit protecting the bad guy, even if it is a family member. It’s time to speak up for Jacob. Please tell me who took our son. If YOU are the abductor, it’s time to tell.  You can’t feel good about this. Find some peace. Please write back. The unwavering search for our missing kids, Is Jacob still alive?  Sometimes the phone rings and there is no one there. It’s probably a telemarketer or a wrong number, but my heart cries out, ”Jacob, are you there?” I save articles of ”kids” who came home after long periods of time: three months, nine months, four years, 7½ years, 10 years, 18½ years.  It CAN happen. I don’t know, so I hope and pray that you got away, Jacob. We need you back. We love you more than the flowers love the sun and the rain. My heart wants to believe you’re OK.  Please give us some answers. What made you think you could steal a child?   Jacob is so deeply loved and missed by his mom and dad, brother, sisters, cousins, neighbors and friends. I have read a lot about kidnappers and child molesters and I know that you are all people, human beings that need help.  Maybe you feel bad. Maybe you told someone, but I still live with so many questions    like, how could you? And how could anyone still keep the secret? You can free yourself of carrying this. Please explain this to me.  2009: Jaycee Dugard’s story gives hope, Why didn’t you let him go?   What happened? You probably had other boys that you victimized and released. I think you meant to let him go and something went terribly wrong. I need to know what happened. Please talk to me. What was the last thing that Jacob said to you?  Jacob had a keen sense of fairness and always stood up for people who he thought needed an ally, a friend. He probably would have befriended you too. I need to hear his voice again or to hear the last words he said if he can’t speak to me himself. Please tell me. More on Jacob’s story"

Scientists discover dinosaur trapped in amber in unprecedented find," (CNN) The tail of a     dinosaur has been found entombed in amber, an unprecedented discovery that has blown away scientists.  Xing Lida, a Chinese paleontologist found the specimen, the size of a dried apricot, at an amber market in northern Myanmar near the Chinese border.  The remarkable piece was destined to end up as a curiosity or piece of jewelry, with Burmese traders believing a plant fragment was trapped inside.  ”I realized that the content was a vertebrate, probably theropod, rather than any plant,” Xing told CNN.  ”I was not sure that (the trader) really understood how important this specimen was, but he did not raise the price.”  Meet China’s dinosaur king, ’Once in a lifetime find’ The findings, which shed fresh light on how dinosaurs looked, are published in the December issue of Current Biology. Ryan McKellar, a paleontologist at the Royal Saskatchwan Museum in Canada and   of the paper, says he was blown away when Xing first showed him the piece of amber.  ”It’s a once in a lifetime find. The finest details are visible and in three dimensions.” Fragments of   bird wings have been found preserved in amber before but this is the first time part of a mummified dinosaur skeleton has been discovered, McKellar said.  The tail section belongs to a young coelurosaurian    from the same group of dinosaurs as the predatory velociraptors and the tyrannosaurus.  The   creature could have danced in the palm of your hand.  The amber, which weighs 6. 5 grams, contains bone fragments and feathers, adding to mounting fossil evidence that many dinosaurs sported primitive plumage rather than scales.  Feathered friends: Dinosaur discoveries, No scaly monster, McKellar said the creature would have had a   tail like a mouse but covered with contour feathers similar to those that give shape and color to birds. ”The more we see these feathered dinosaurs and how widespread the feathers are, things like a scaly velociraptor seem less and less likely and they’ve become a lot more bird like in the overall view,” he said. ”They’re not quite the   scaly monsters we once thought.” Not so terrible: Many dinosaurs cooed rather than roared, The amber preserved pigmentation from the feathers allowing the scientists to assess with some certainty how it looked.  Seen under a microscope, the feathers suggest the creature was chestnut brown and white.  ”It really underlines the importance of amber as an anchor for future study. We’re picking up features we couldn’t see in compressed sedimentary fossils, ” said McKellar.  Previous studies on dinosaur coloring have had to rely on the difficult task of capturing information from melansomes    tiny structures buried within feathers that give them color    and comparing them with bird feathers.   In the ”Jurassic Park” movie franchise, scientists extract dinosaur DNA from blood found inside insects preserved in amber. McKellar said that soft tissue and decayed blood from the tail were found in the amber but no genetic material was preserved.  ”Unfortunately, the Jurassic Park answer is still a ’no’    this is firmly in the realm of science fiction,” he said.

Antonio Sabato Jr: Hollywood Blacklisting My Peers Just for Attending RNC - Breitbart,"Actor Antonio Sabato Jr. claims he has been “viciously” targeted online and has been effectively blacklisted from Hollywood since he spoke in support of Donald Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland last month. [In an interview with Variety, the    model and soap opera star  —   who spoke on the first day of the Republican convention about his support for Trump  —   said that directors have contacted his agents and told them they will never work with him again.  “On Twitter, there’s been name calling, and celebrities attacking me. That’s fine,” Sabato told Variety. “I see it, but I don’t read it. I block them and delete them and move on. There’s so much negativity you can be taken into that. But I’ve also heard from celebrities: ‘If he can do it, I want to speak my mind too.’ They are fed up with the way this country has been running and by all these lies. ” At the convention, Sabato detailed how he immigrated to the United States lawfully, after waiting for nearly 11 years. The actor, originally from Rome, said he had “followed all the rules” in the immigration process, and reiterated the need for other immigrants to do the same. “Donald Trump is for unity,” Sabato said during his brief speech. “Donald Trump believes in one America, with liberty and justice for all. Having secure borders, protecting our citizens, none of this is hateful. This is the responsibility of the government. And it’s the right thing to do. Donald Trump will get it done and get back on the right track. ” Sabato said that even though he and millions of other Americans support Trump in his bid for the presidency, the liberal Hollywood industry he has made a living in “doesn’t like that. ” “A lot of the bosses, a lot of the executives, they own the channels, they own the media. They donate millions to Hillary Clinton and President Obama,” he told Variety. “I’m just a normal dude speaking my mind. So be it. I will keep fighting for what I believe, and I will keep looking for work. ” “My work and my life is based on God,” Sabato continued. “My leader, the one I look up to, is Jesus Christ. I’ve seen people in the industry say, ‘I’m not going to talk to this guy, because he talks about Jesus Christ.’ It shows the true personalities of these people. Well, I wouldn’t want to work with them anyway. But if I acted the same way as they did, I would never work for anybody. They are all with Hillary. ” The actor added that he knows people who have been blacklisted by the industry simply for attending the Republican convention. “You’re supposed to be hired based on your talent and abilities, not because of how you feel about politics or religion. But that’s how they do things,” Sabato explained. “It’s not just me. I know a lot of people in the industry who are in the same boat. The reality is if you’re associated with the Republican Party, the casting directors and producers already blacklist you based on that. ” In concluding the interview, Sabato reiterated his convention prediction that Trump would defeat Clinton in November’s general election. “I’m never going to leave Hollywood. I’m going to go after it one way or another,” he told Variety. “I’m just speaking the truth  —   people don’t know how this business works. I feel strongly about the fact that Donald Trump is going to win. I think he’ll be elected in November. ” Watch Sabato’s full speech from the Republican National Convention above.

Hiring Criminals to Hire Criminals: Your Tax Dollars at Work,"I. “Every Cop is a Criminal”  Here’s a headline for you, from The Washington Post: “Cities begin to challenge a bedrock of justice: They’re paying criminals not to kill. ” Yes, you read that right: According to the Post’s Aaron C. Davis, reporting from Richmond, CA —  just across the bay from San Francisco —  criminals are going on the city payroll, as “fellows. ” You know, like fellows in an academic setting, only not quite. To illustrate this intriguing social phenomenon, the Post focused on the case of one    Lonnie Holmes, who definitely falls into the category of “at risk,” but now has a new gig: “When Holmes was released from prison last year, officials in this city offered something unusual to try to keep him alive: money. They began paying Holmes as much as $1, 000 a month not to commit another gun crime. ” Yes, the program, Operation Peacemaker Fellowship, is a real thing, run out of Richmond’s Office of Neighborhood Safety yet perhaps we can call it, more simply, the Richmond Plan. And yes, you can be sure that the federal government, through any number of HUD and HHS programs, is helping out —  so even if you don’t live in Richmond, CA, it’s your tax dollars at work. As the Post story continues, “The city has hired   to mentor dozens of its most violent offenders and allows them to take unconventional steps if it means preventing the next homicide. ” Hiring criminals to hire criminals —  what could go wrong? (As an aside, it would be interesting to know what Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders think of this idea —  and perhaps, as the presidential campaign comes to California, we’ll find out.) Yes, as part of the Richmond Plan, if you’re an   youth in Richmond, you could be paid up to $1000 a month if you can convince a “mentor” —  the mentors being mostly older “at risk” men —  that you’ll behave. And by “behave,” the authorities don’t require any drastic curtailment of your current lifestyle, such as, say, going straight they merely require that you pledge to commit no more murders —  although, as we shall see, even that’s negotiable. One thing is for sure: The   relationship in the Richmond Plan has nothing to do with the police, no sirree. As the Post explains, “The   mentors operate at a distance from police. To maintain the trust of the young men they’re guiding, mentors do not inform police of what they know about crimes committed. At least twice, that may have allowed suspected killers in the stipend program to evade responsibility for homicides. ” Yes, the mentors, typically   themselves, are very definitely not on the side of the cops. Indeed, given the    nature of the whole program, it’s little surprise that the Post story details a mentor coming across one of his mentees on the street —  and the mentee being enveloped in “a cloud of marijuana smoke. ” This incident might lead some to find a perverse “benefit” of the program, in that the subsidized youths are maybe too stoned to commit crimes, and yet evidently, the young men still have plenty of   spirit: “Mentors have coaxed inebriated teenagers threatening violence into city cars, not for a ride to jail but home to sleep it off —  sometimes with loaded firearms still in their waistbands. ” Indeed, the Post adds, it’s virtually impossible to be ejected from the program, no matter what the behavior: “When the elaborate efforts at engagement fail, the mentors still pay those who pledge to improve, even when, like Holmes, they are caught with a gun, or worse —  suspected of murder. ” And let’s not forget the travel benefits: “The mentors have funded trips to South Africa, London and Mexico City for rival gang members in the hope that shared experiences and time away from the city streets would ease tensions and forge new connections. ” Wouldn’t we all like to take international vacations at the government’s expense? Surely, that would ease tensions for everyone of us! What gives the Richmond Plan added salience is that it is being closely studied by other cities around the country —  with an eye toward replication. In February, for example, the Washington, DC city council voted, unanimously, in favor of the idea. Yet the District’s Democratic mayor, Muriel Bowser, and the DC chief of police, Cathy Lanier, are resisting. As the Post explains, these opponents challenge just about every assertion made on behalf of the Richmond Plan: [Lanier] and Kevin Donahue, Bow ser’s deputy mayor for public safety, question the veracity of Richmond’s claims of having saved so many of the city’s most violent offenders, since mentors —  and not police —  pick the participants and there has not been a control group used to measure outcomes. “There’s never been a real evaluation of the program,” Lanier said. “They didn’t design the program to allow it to be evaluated,” Donahue added. Still, even if the Richmond Plan can’t really be evaluated, some data are emerging: For instance, there’s a 20 percent rate (that we know about) of repeat criminality, and there have been “only” four deaths: “Five years into Richmond’s   experiment, 84 of 88 young men who have participated in the program remain alive, and 4 in 5 have not been suspected of another gun crime or suffered a bullet wound, according to DeVone Boggan, founder of the Richmond effort. ” The Post continues, ominously, “Four of the program’s fellows have died since 2010, including two who were killed by other fellows [according to the suspicions of Richmond Plan leaders]. The suspected killers have not been charged and remain in the program. ” Got that? Suspected killers remind on the payroll. Moreover, the Post adds, “Two killings in the past month —  of a    and     —  have pierced the aura of success. For all the efforts by the mentors to identify the most likely to be caught in violence and bring them into the program, they weren’t aware of either of the victims. ” Virgil is old enough to remember the 1960s, when the same idea —  hire the hoodlums to make them slightly less   —  was popular. Back then, it was the Black Panthers and other “Black Power” groups getting grants from the Office of Economic Opportunity and other Great Society  . In that crazy era, in 1967 to be precise, Hollywood actually made a film, The Dirty Dozen, based on the absurd premise that the US Army in WW2 would send send convicted criminals and psychopaths on an important commando mission —  and that the mission would succeed. In other words, the film’s message was a siren song for the worst kind of nihilism: If you will only open up the prisons, good things will happen! In the following year, 1968, the Rolling Stones nailed the nuttiness of the Zeitgeist with their classic song, “Sympathy for the Devil,” including these lyrics: Just as every cop is a criminalAnd all the sinners saints, We might note that the amount of violent crime in America rose nearly 500 percent from 1960 to 1980. Things started to calm down only after Ronald Reagan was elected. II. We’ve Been Down This Road Before, and Solved the Problem —  So What’s Different Today?  It can be argued, of course, that the Richmond Plan is relatively inexpensive. Yet, the $   stipend that “fellows” receive is only part of the cost of the Plan, and even the whole program doesn’t include all the spending, from all sources, by the welfare system on these young men. Yet almost no matter how high the welfare expenditures might be, the cost, to society, of crimes committed and   imposed is surely greater. So if the Richmond Plan were actually to reduce criminality, it might be worth it. However, as we have seen, it’s not so clear that the Richmond Plan is reducing crime at all. It’s entirely possible that the Richmond Plan is simply a scam. And that certainly has been the pattern of   “ ” over the last  : The charismatically authentic “community” leader, typically adored by the MSM, turns out to be just another con man. Yet at the same time, we can observe that there is value in giving idle hands something to do —  and getting them off the mean streets. Indeed, the strategic relocation of potential troublemakers was the big idea behind the New   Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) which, from 1933 to 1942, hired millions of young men and sent them to rural labor camps. The CCC was operated, we might add, by the US Army, which imposed military discipline on its enlistees. So we can see the difference, then and now: The CCC was run by a stern,   organization with a proven track record of producing good workers and good soldiers some say that the CCC program paid for itself in terms of the public works and   improvements it built. Whether or not that’s true, it’s undeniable that millions of CCC alums entered into the US military during WW2 and became good soldiers —  and that was priceless. By contrast, today’s Richmond Plan consists of criminals hiring criminals, while keeping them in their ‘hoods. And thus, in contrast to the CCC, the Richmond Plan likely does little, if anything, to slow down the     progression —  from street corner, to prison, to the grave. Indeed, as we think about what works in   and   we might agree that one can’t inculcate virtue into the   without, oneself, having virtue. That is, if the name of the game is changing lives, insincere hypocrites and outright frauds are not helpful. We’re not saying, here, that all   workers need to be saints. But we are declaring that the structure itself must be basically sound, more right than wrong: It must prize honesty over dishonesty,   over violence —  and all the rules must be enforced in a fair manner. As George Will once put it, back when he was a conservative —  that is, before he became a libertarian —  “Statecraft is soulcraft. ” Furthermore, we can readily see that the needed   presupposes a considerable degree of control over the subject population. That is, you have to have their undivided attention. By contrast, if     is the highest value, it’s unlikely that an   program will succeed in changing risky behavior. III. Soulcraft: Indoor and Outdoor, As we think about   programs that have worked in the past,  we can make a useful categorical distinction: between what the English called “Outdoor Relief” and “Indoor Relief. ” (And here Virgil declares his intellectual indebtedness to the great scholar Gertrude Himmelfarb, author of a string of books on the history of   efforts, both successful and unsuccessful. Outdoor Relief means aiding people who find themselves in dire straits and, otherwise, leaving them alone. We can observe that Outdoor Relief works well enough in emergency situations, e. g. where a given population has been struck by a failed harvest or some other natural disaster. The operating assumption of Outdoor Relief is that the people in need are basically functional, but just down on their luck. The hope is that once aid is provided, the recipients will quickly pull themselves together and resume being   once again. By contrast, Indoor Relief means bringing poor people into some institutional setting and then ministering to them, with an eye toward improving their personal behavior and economic viability. (As one might gather, the word “ministering” bespeaks the religious origins of this concept unfortunately, here in the US, over the last century, actual ministers have been mostly eliminated from the process, replaced by secular social workers who provide “counseling,” or “empowerment. ”) Returning to England, we can note that beginning in the 17th century, the island nation began to systematize Indoor Relief. And we can pause to recognize that many readers might bridle at the thought of welfare for anyone. Yet at the time, the English thought they were simply following the Christian injunction to be their brother’s keeper. Moreover they knew that deliberate government policies, such as the Black Act and the many Enclosure Acts, had suddenly deprived rural folk of their traditional ability to make a living. So, mindful that loose and desperate populations were a formula for trouble, the English developed Poor Houses, providing food and shelter for “paupers. ” Yet at the same time, the Overseers of the Poor (an actual  ) applied heavy behavioral modification to their charges for example, the sexes were strictly segregated. Thus the idea of   relief was impossible: For the English authorities, the mission, which mostly succeeded, was to turn paupers into good citizens and, if necessary, good soldiers and sailors. In other words, English   policy wasn’t driven by soggy liberalism, but rather, by   practicality. The animating idea of Indoor Relief was tough love: Inmates in the Poor Houses would not starve, but conditions were such that it was a good idea to leave them as soon as possible. It was, of course, easy to attack Poor Houses: Charles Dickens did so constantly in his novels. Yet it’s worth recalling that until the Industrial Revolution, England was poor, like the rest of the world only with the coming of factories did the economic tide of the country start to rise, at which point the boats of the poor rose, too. Indeed, if one compares English social conditions in 1600 to conditions in 1900, it’s evident that the overall system of advancement worked well. Here we can observe that the Poor Houses, and English   efforts in in general, benefited enormously from religious participation. The Methodists, for example, were notable for their tirelessness in delivering effective messages of temperance and uplift. Indeed, it’s fair to say that the Methodists created the English bourgeoisie. In addition, England also experimented with Outdoor Relief, in the form of the Speenhamland System, adopted in the south of England in 1795. Confronted, in that last decade of the 18th century, by the bloody terror of the French Revolution —  and worried that it might be internationally contagious —  the English elite knew that it had to do something, and fast. Hence the Speenhamland System, providing direct assistance to the poor where they lived. The Speenhamland System was targeted on London and its environs, the capital being, after all, a potentially revolutionary city. Needless to say, even though the individual allowances were small —  too small to effect   adversely —  the   System was expensive. And after 1815, when the threat of French Revolutionary Jacobinism had faded away, so did the Speenhamland System England returned to the narrower (and cheaper) concept of Indoor Relief. IV. American Welfare Policy Today, Now to America in the 20th century and beyond: Here, we’ve tried just about everything —  Outdoor Relief, Indoor Relief, and hybrids of the two. Social Security, the most popular and effective social program of the 20th century, is a sterling example of Outdoor Relief that is, the   recipient gets a check at his or her residence. Yet since Social Security is based on   —  the senior has to have worked and paid in, in order to take out upon retirement —  it has no negative behavioral effects on the work habits of the  . Welfare is also an Outdoor Relief program, although it is based on a much different premise: There is no presumption of work and, all too often, no pressure to get a job. And that’s why welfare, and related programs, such as food stamps and Medicaid, have been so disastrous. In 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared that welfare was a “narcotic,” and he was right. Indeed, by 2016, we should have learned: It’s deeply destructive simply to give money to people who haven’t done anything, at any point in their lives, to earn it —  and then allow such payments to become a   entitlement. So today, we’ve had four or five generations of a “culture of poverty” that is so destructive that it even snuffs out the lives of many of its “beneficiaries” at an early age. And as we have seen, one of the perverse fruits of this noxious thicket of tangled thinking and costly spending programs is the Richmond Plan. Okay, so those are some Outdoor Relief programs. Now, what of Indoor Relief programs? We’ve had plenty of them, too, although not so many lately. The institutionalization of the mentally ill is an Indoor program —  or at least it was. In the middle of the last century, a long string of exposes —  from Hollywood, from television, and from every other medium —  convinced many Americans that mental hospitals and asylums were irredeemably awful. It is certainly hard to defend these big institutions as they were, but perhaps the answer was to make them better —  to spend more money, and to make the reforms, to make them humane. But the opponents of mental hospitals weren’t interested in reform —  they wanted closure. And the opposition movement was a itself a  remarkable, and powerful, fusion of the libertarian left and the libertarian right. The   were led by the ACLU, of course. Yet we might pause to recall another hugely influential figure in those days: Thomas Szasz, author of The Myth of Mental Illness and many similar works. Szasz’s argument was, in effect, that we should blame society for all ills: That is, it was never the individual’s fault, it was always the collective’s fault. And so, for example, the individual should be free to take any and all psychoactive drugs, as a needed   against an oppressive civilization. To put Szasz’s argument another way, it was all of society that was crazy, not a few unlucky people. That line of thinking itself might sound   today, but at the time, in the 60s and 70s, it was taken seriously by many. Meanwhile, at the other end of the ideological spectrum, the   led by Milton Friedman, might have known that the mentally ill were, well, mentally ill. Yet even so, the Friedmanites couldn’t pass up the opportunity to save tax money by shutting down expensive institutions. Moreover, there’s no small strain of thinking on the right which holds that man is just an economic being —  homo economicus —  and so managing human behavior is mostly a matter of getting the carrots and sticks right. As economists sometimes joke, “There are no bad people, just bad incentives. ” And thus the libertarian left and the libertarian right teamed up to form a pincer movement —  a pincer movement on common sense —  and the result was the massive   of the mentally ill: The inmate ill simply went from beds in hospitals to sidewalks on the streets. Thus, supervised Indoor Relief became unsupervised Outdoor Relief. And if mental hospitals are no longer forbidding fortresses of fear, well, the streets themselves have become lonely desolation boulevards, where the addled homeless are free —  free to freeze to death, free to die in the night amidst their shopping bags, free to be murdered in a feud over a good begging place. Meanwhile, as we have seen for decades, the consequences for our cities are obvious: Our public places are crowded with dangerous crazy people, and so ordinary citizens, mindful of themselves and their families, choose to live elsewhere —  as in, as far away as possible. As The Atlantic noted this month, for all the glib talk about downtown gentrification and   bohemias, the most popular destinations in America are found in the suburban sprawl of Texas, far from the hobo jungles. In the sly words of writer Derek Thompson, “New York Times Styles Section readers could be forgiven for thinking everybody is following a trail from Manhattan to south Brooklyn to Los Angeles and San Francisco, and then bouncing to Austin or Portland. ” But in fact, the most favored places are  …     Dallas and Houston. And while those Texas towns certainly have their homeless populations, in that reddest of red states, they are policed, and regulated, in a way that they are not in, say, San Francisco or New York. Of course, now that the Obama administration and the courts have once again squelched the Lone Star State’s desire to   welfare recipients, it’s possible that Texas will soon more closely resemble California, and other states which seem happy to permanently accommodate huge, and hopeless, welfare populations. To sum up this discussion: It’s fine to provide Outdoor Relief, when it’s desperately needed, to a socially and morally intact population. But it’s not so fine to provide Outdoor Relief, permanently, to a chaotic and violent population. Troubled people need the   of Indoor Relief, even if they hate it. The point of Indoor Relief is to change behavior, to get the person on the track of   productivity. (And yes, as we have seen, if the liberals get their way, they will eliminate all the sanctioning teeth in Indoor Relief.) Meanwhile, what they’re doing in Richmond, CA is perhaps the most outrageous Outdoor Relief program ever —  they are actively subsidizing murderous pathology, so of course, they’ll get more of it. And yes, it’s possible that this uniquely vile idea will be coming soon to a city near you."
‘The BFG’ Stumbles as ‘Finding Dory’ Rules Box Office - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES  —   Hollywood’s   summer lineup continued to falter over the weekend, at least in North America, as two movies carrying a combined $500 million in production and global marketing costs arrived to $57. 7 million in total ticket sales. “The BFG,” directed by Steven Spielberg and released by Walt Disney Studios, was envisioned as a return to family form for the director  —   marketing materials reminded consumers that he made “E. T. ”  —   but it ended up as a colossal misfire. The movie, an   fantasy that drew appreciative reviews, took in about $19. 6 million Friday through Sunday, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. Faring better was “The Legend of Tarzan. ” Starring Alexander Skarsgard as the   and made by Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow, “Tarzan” collected roughly $38. 1 million over the   period. That total was much higher than analysts predicted before release. Most critics turned up their noses, but audiences gave the film an   in CinemaScore exit polls, suggesting positive word of mouth. Even so, “Tarzan” remains squarely in the loser column when it comes to profitability. Loaded with visual effects  —   violent apes, stampeding wildebeests  —   the movie cost a   $180 million to make, not counting marketing. “This property has always really been about the international opportunity,” Jeff Goldstein, Warner’s executive vice president of domestic distribution, said by phone on Sunday. “You can best assess it a month from now. ” Directed by David Yates and   Margot Robbie, “Tarzan” opened in limited overseas release over the weekend, taking in $18. 8 million. Important markets like Britain and China are still to come. While acknowledging a “frustrating” result for “The BFG” at home, David Hollis, Disney’s distribution chief, also pointed to international audiences as a potential salvation for the movie, which is based on a book by Roald Dahl. “We’re really proud of the film,” Mr. Hollis said. “We’re going to be reliant in a lot of ways on international. ” So far, “The BFG” has opened in only two overseas markets, Russia and Australia. With “The BFG” collapsing in North America and “Tarzan” not exactly sizzling, the No. 1 movie on Hollywood’s home turf over the July Fourth weekend was again “Finding Dory. ” That sequel, from Disney’s Pixar division, took in an estimated $41. 9 million for a   domestic total of $372. 3 million. “Tarzan” was second. Third place went to “The Purge: Election Year” (Universal) a horror sequel that cost only $10 million to make and roughly $20 million to market. It sold a strong $30. 9 million in tickets. Blumhouse Productions, the   company behind the “Purge” series, has successfully kept this franchise going by pursuing different storytelling styles. The previous installment had action underpinnings this one added a political dimension. The summer box office always has ups and downs, but the current season has been much bumpier than usual. Disney has found two monster hits (“Finding Dory” and “Captain America: Civil War”) but has also suffered two major flops (“The BFG” and “Alice Through the Looking Glass”). Other   movies that have received a disappointing response from domestic audiences include “Independence Day: Resurgence,” “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows” and “Warcraft. ” An   on sequels has been one reason for Hollywood’s rough ride. But analysts have cautioned about overgeneralizing at the season’s midway point. Several movies ahead could still salvage the summer box office, including “The Secret Life of Pets,” “Ghostbusters” and “Suicide Squad. ”"

Milo: Why Does Everyone Think Bernie Sanders Is A Nice Person? - Breitbart,"Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos sat down with Dave Rubin of The Rubin Report this week to discuss Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders and the growing army of cultural libertarians.[  On the topic of Bernie Sanders, Yiannopoulos questioned the assumption that he is a “nice guy. ” “People think Bernie Sanders is nice. I don’t get it  …    is he a nice guy? No, he wants socialism in America. It’s poisonous, ugly, oppressive, political philosophy that has made people suffer everywhere that it’s been tried. ” Yiannopoulos claimed that the end of social justice culture may be near: “If they break this time, they are losing with the full support of politicians, the media, and academia. If people rise up and say this social justice thing, this language policing, this political correctness, safe spaces, trigger warnings, microaggressions  —   this stuff is horsesh*t  …    . If enough people smash its stranglehold on the public square, it will never recover,” Yiannopoulos claimed. “It will never come back like this again because it will lose at the height of its powers. It will lose in its strongest possible form. ” “Social justice cannot get any stronger than it is now. It’s at the peak of its powers and it is losing. It’s losing because people want freedom. they want to be able to do, say, think, be, play, and read anything,” Yiannopoulos said.  “They have the faith in themselves and in other people that they are able to make the best judgements for themselves on what they believe in. They don’t need to be told how to speak. They don’t need to be told which books to read. They don’t need to be told which video games are dangerous. They don’t need to be told any of these things. They don’t be instructed and lectured to by politicians, they don’t need to be badgered and hectored by feminists, and they don’t need to be lied to by journalists. When pressed by Rubin about the role of emotion in cultural libertarianism, Yiannopoulos made clear that “cultural libertarianism is not about feeling. Cultural libertarianism is a response to feelings over facts. The defining characteristic of cultural libertarianism is the rigorous adherence to   policy making, and   beliefs. And a rigorous insistence on classical liberalism. It has very little do with feelings. It has a lot to do with fun. ” Yiannopoulos’ closing argument affirmed the importance of individualism and personal liberties: “What is behind all of this, the heart of all of this, is that rejection, that fundamental rejection of the idea that somebody else knows better than I do how I should live my life. ” Tom Ciccotta writes about Freedom of Speech and Intellectual Diversity for Breitbart.

BBC Says Opposing Shariah Law Is ’Islamophobic’,"The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)  —   a public broadcaster funded by a “TV licence” fee forced on UK television owners  —   has declared that resistance to Shariah law is “Islamophobic”. [According to a news clip, BBC online coverage, and the comments of its reporter Catrin Nye, a man called “Paul” approached a BBC film crew while recording an interview with Islam campaigner Ruqaiya Haris.  Ms. Haris, a Muslim activist and student at the School of Oriental and African Studies, is told by Paul, “There’s no Sharia law here”. Her and Ms. Nye’s reactions to the statement made freely in a public place are nothing short of hysterical. The clip opens with Ms. Haris openly stating that she doesn’t believe in condemning recent terror attacks. Her voice, solemn and almost bored, changes immediately when the man known as Paul confronts us. A man interrupts an interview I’m doing about Islamophobia  …    with Islamophobia. My new story on rising Twitter abusehttps:  .   —   Catrin Nye (@CatrinNye) August 18, 2016,  Ms. Haris bolts up from her interview on a park bench as Ms. Nye glares in a disgusted manner at the man. “Do you wanna talk about Shariah law, you wanna talk about Shariah law to me?” she shouts at the man as she stands over him. “I wasn’t talking to you,” says Paul, attempting to extricate himself from a situation where one of the world’s largest broadcasters now has its cameras turned on him while a Muslim woman and a BBC presenter scream questions at him. He calmly states, in the awkwardly clipped BBC footage, “We’re losing our right to freedom of expression”. “Why’s that?” asks Ms. Nye, moments after she attempted to shout him down. The man remains seated in the grass and you can see in the reflection in his sunglasses there are at least three people standing over him, filming and firing questions. “We’re being told to be politically correct when we don’t want to be politically correct,” he calmly states. The BBC then clipped its footage of the incident, uploaded it to its website and social media channels, and headlined it: “BBC Islamophobia discussion interrupted by Islamophobia”. The BBC refused to provide Breitbart London with the unedited footage of the incident. There is no indication as to what was “Islamophobic” about the man’s comments, leading social media users to believe that the BBC’s position on Islamophobia is now opposition to Shariah law. Ms. Haris told the Express newspaper: “I receive abuse online pretty much every day regardless of what I say, insulting my hijab or throwing out stereotypes and insults”. But insulting the hijab is also hardly Islamophobic. Indeed many in the West see the hijab as a symbol of oppression against women, and in opposing it are simply standing up for classical liberal, Western values. But Mr. Haris’s own Twitter stream features a litany of   and   abuse. She frequently engages in tirades at other Twitter users, as well as blaming white people for global ills  —   a similar stereotype to the ones she opposes when claiming that not all Muslims should be held to the actions of Islamic terrorists. On her Twitter account, Mr. Haris admits to having “lost it” with Paul in the park, adding: “he was irritating me big time”. But the BBC did not headline its coverage, “Muslim Activist ‘Loses It’ With ‘Irritating Man’” instead aiming to stoke the fires of “Islamophobia” in Britain. She has also said she has “very little desire to prove my   humanity of all Muslims to people”."
Charges dropped in Chandra Levy murder," (CNN) A judge on Thursday dismissed murder charges against a man accused in the death of Chandra Levy, a Washington intern whose 2001 disappearance created national headlines. Federal prosecutors said they can no longer prove a case against Ingmar Guandique, Bill Miller, public information officer for the U. S. Attorney’s Office in Washington, said in a news release.  ”Today, in the interests of justice and based on recent unforeseen developments that were investigated over the past week, the office moved to dismiss the case charging Ingmar Guandique with the May 2001 murder of Chandra Levy,”  he said. Miller did not specify what the developments were.  The public defender’s office said the dismissal vindicates Guandique, who had always maintained his innocence, passed a lie detector test and was the victim of ”the most unreliable evidence: a jailhouse informant.” Levy, a    California native, was in Washington working as an intern for the Bureau of Prisons when she was last seen on May 1, 2001. Her skull was found more than a year later, on May 22, 2002, in Rock Creek Park. Levy’s disappearance gained national attention after her parents discovered a connection between her and Gary Condit, who was then a congressman for Levy’s California district.  Condit was never a suspect in the case, but he and Levy were romantically linked and Condit was questioned intensively about Levy’s whereabouts. Levy’s mother, Susan Levy, said she was ”totally in a state of shock.” ”I am sick to my stomach and am having trauma and grief all over again,” she said. Levy had no comment when asked what the government told her about dropping the charges, but said she hopes prosecutors will ”put the information out there.” ”We all want our truth,” she said. ”I want to make sure we find out the truth. My husband and I hope that justice is found for our family.” Condit issued a statement Thursday through his lawyer, saying he was disappointed in the dismissal. ”The failure of authorities to bring formal closure to this tragedy after 15 years is very disappointing but in no way alters the fact that Mr. Condit was long ago completely exonerated by authorities in connection with Ms. Levy’s death,” according to the statement. Guandique, an illegal immigrant from El Salvador, was sentenced to 60 years in prison after being convicted in 2010 of killing and robbing Levy.  His lawyers appealed the conviction and questioned the credibility of prosecution witness Armando Morales, a convicted felon and former gang member who testified that Guandique confessed to him that he killed Levy. A judge granted a new trial in May 2015 and the hearing was scheduled for October. Miller said prosecutors will not pursue the retrial. Beyond Miller’s brief statement, prosecutors didn’t comment on the case. Public defender criticizes government case, Laura E. Hankins of the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia said, ”This dismissal vindicates Mr. Guandique.  Finally, the government has had to concede the flaws in its   conviction.” Morales, she said, was ”a perjurer who too easily manipulated the prosecutors.” ”Because the government hid the identity of the jailhouse informant from the defense until just before trial and failed to provide critical documents to the defense, it took years of   investigation and litigation by the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia to uncover the extent of the flaws in Mr. Guandique’s trial and to force the government to search and   its own records,” she said. In a motion to dismiss filed last December, defense lawyers said Morales told District of Columbia prosecutors he’d never cooperated with authorities before the Guandique case because he adhered to a ”don’t snitch” philosophy.  But Morales had cooperated with different prosecutors over the years in exchange for favorable accommodations in prison, the documents said. The motion also said prosecutors hid information from the defense, including the first page of Morales’ original   statement about Guandique’s supposed confession and other documents. Guandique is in ICE custody, Police arrested Guandique in February 2009. He was then serving a   sentence for attacking two other women in the park. Judge Robert Morin of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia signed an order dismissing the charges. Guandique was released to the custody of immigration officials on Saturday and now faces deportation proceedings.  ICE issued this statement: ”Based on today’s court action, Ingmar Guandique will enter the custody of U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and be issued a notice to appear in immigration court. Due to his previous criminal convictions, he is considered a threat to public safety, and ICE intends to maintain him in custody.”"
Wikileaks: Clinton Memo Reveals Joint Fundraising Tactics with Super PAC,"Emails belonging to Clinton campaign chair John Podesta released by Wikileaks this week reveals a close, working relationship with a super PAC despite promises of outlawing such arrangements within the first month of her potential presidency. [Clinton in a February 2016 primary debate with Senator Bernie Sanders denied any assertion that her official campaign and the super PAC, Priorities USA, “coordinate” on any matter and suggested an organic decision process on the part of the soft money group to support her apparently occurred.   In subsequent months, Clinton promised a constitutional amendment to essentially upend the Citizens United ruling allowing commercial and labor interests to form organizations that supported particular candidates or causes, according to POLITICO. To further personalize her fight against the ruling allowing for super PACs to flourish, the Clinton camp produced a video for a dedicated page on her website to promote the position of getting “unaccountable money out of our politics. ” The Democrat nominee most recently brought the issue of needing to remove super PACs from the American electoral system in the second presidential debate against Donald Trump, according to The Wall Street Journal. Public positions against the use of super PAC organizations aside,   emails and a campaign finance memo detail the lengths to which the campaign coordinated with Priorities USA with particular emphasis on sharing fundraising leads, joint donor relations efforts, and general communications. A memo penned by Clinton election counsel Marc Elias offered a scenario how a campaign staffer should properly share a donor lead to a super PAC fundraiser: Permissible: “Donor A works in financial services and has been a   contributor. I think she’d be willing to do six figures for Priorities. ” Not recommended: “I want you to call Donor A and ask for $250, 000. ” The memo reminds Clinton staffers that if they are in a situation where they are raising funds on behalf of Priorities USA, “they must include a hard money ask (for $5, 000 or less) during the course of the conversation. ” Clinton attorneys stressed that communications between the campaign and PAC be limited to conversations involving fundraising and avoid topics related to polling, messaging or other strategic issues. A separate email thread indicating a Google Calendar invitation between key Clinton staffers and legal counsel reflected a March 7, 2016 conference titled “Super Pacs  ”. The invitation did not suggest any specific agenda items or whether “Super Pacs” referred to groups in addition to Priorities USA.

Lilly Pulitzer for Target causes shopping frenzy," (CNN) Preschool teacher Jacquie Truesdale woke up around 5 a. m. Sunday and walked over to the closest Target in Coral Springs, Florida, around 6:30 a. m. Her goal? Secure a few items from Target’s collaboration with Lilly Pulitzer, the queen of American resortwear known for her bright, bold patterns. Truesdale, a Lilly Pulitzer loyalist, arrived with an idea of what she wanted based on sneak peeks of the collection online. When doors opened at 8, she was the second person in the store and made off with a few shift dresses, tote bags, two pillows and a pair of sandals. She was one of the lucky ones. Pastel dresses and beach coverups flew off the racks at Target stores Sunday morning as eager shoppers snatched up apparel, accessories and home decor from the limited edition collection. Much of the collection was sold out online and in stores within hours of going on sale Sunday morning, drawing ire from Lilly lovers who missed out on the chance to own discounted versions of the brand’s designs. Target began responding to disgruntled customers via Twitter early Sunday morning, when   Target. com shoppers began complaining about website outages and difficulties placing orders. By Sunday afternoon, most items on Target. com were out of stock, forcing the retailer to break the news that no more inventory would be restocked. ”The #LillyforTarget collection is available for a  . We do not anticipate more items becoming available,” the retailer said through its @AskTarget account. ”We are learning from these experiences and sharing with our online and store teams,” the company said in response to another irate customer. The   collection features items in 15 exclusive prints at attractive prices compared to other stores. Lilly’s signature sleeveless, collarless shift for adults currently retails from $180 to $300 the Target version is available for $38. Target’s Lilly bikinis are priced at $48 for the top and bottom, compared to $136 for the two pieces. Lines started forming as early as 5 a. m. outside Target stores across the country for the colorful collection. Pictures on social media showed lines extending into parking lots.

French Open 2015: Serena Williams rallies to make final,"Paris (CNN) A visibly ailing Serena Williams coughed throughout her semifinal match at the French Open, trudged to her chair during changeovers and once there, sought the respite of ice towels on the hottest day of a tournament blighted by cool temperatures and blustery winds. At times she was close to tears.  But nothing it seems can prevent Williams from capturing a 20th grand slam title and third in Paris.  She overturned set deficits in the second, third and fourth rounds, and on Thursday fended off illness    plus an opponent playing the finest tennis of her career.  The world No. 1 battled in typical fashion to force a third set and prevailed       over   Timea Bacsinszky to set up an encounter with Lucie Safarova in Saturday’s conclusion to the women’s event.  Her condition wasn’t much better by the time the near   contest ended. She had to cut short her   interview post match because the cough returned, perhaps afflicted by the same illness that struck 2014 champion Maria Sharapova.  And she was a   for the usually mandatory   press conference, issuing a statement instead.  ”I have been feeling unwell for a few days, and after this tough match against Timea, I needed to see the tournament doctor,” Williams said.  ”I am proud to be back in the final here at Roland Garros, in a city that means so much to me, and am determined to be 100% ready for the final against Lucie on Saturday,” added the American, who owns an apartment in Paris and is coached by Frenchman Patrick Mouratoglou.  Safarova, unlike Williams, has yet to drop a set after seeing off Ana Ivanovic     in the first semifinal on   court. A tall,     from the Czech Republic making the finale wouldn’t have surprised many but instead of Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova it’s the 13th seed.  Williams won for the 24th time in 27 attempts in a grand slam semifinal. Her only conquerors? Justine Henin, Kim Clijsters and older sister Venus, a multiple grand slam winning trio.    If she achieves that 20th major, it would place the    second in the Open Era only behind Steffi Graf’s 22. A rest day Friday could help Williams recover, and she leads Safarova    who will make her debut in a grand slam final      in their   .  Bacsinszky, who quit tennis more than two years ago to pursue a career in the hotel industry, orchestrated a   performance in the early stages, aided by Williams’ lethargy. Bludgeoning power on her backhand and mixing in drop shots contributed to Williams’ misery.  But after Bacsinszky    whose   winning streak was stopped by Williams in March    broke for   in the second set, she didn’t claim another game.  Williams awoke and Bacsinszky’s weaker forehand side crumbled. When the Swiss missed two easy forehands to get broken to begin the third, there was realistically no chance of a comeback: Williams hadn’t lost a third set since last August.  ”Well maybe she struggled but at the end she’s the winner of the match,” Bacsinszky told reporters.  Ivanovic ousted Safarova on the way to collecting her first and only grand slam crown in Paris in 2008 but their meeting last year at Roland Garros proved to be more of a predictor for this year’s outcome    Safarova triumphed in straight sets in the third round.  ”It’s slowly sinking in and it’s just amazing,” Safarova said of making a grand slam final. ”The happiness is unreal.” She famously missed a match point fractionally long against eventual champion Li Na at last year’s Australian Open but hasn’t let the disappointment linger.  Safarova made the semifinals at Wimbledon, helped the Czech Republic win the Fed Cup in November and this March achieved a   of No. 11.  Just by landing in the semis in Paris, she was sure to move into the top 10.  ”I think she’s always known she’s had the potential,” Safarova’s coach, Rob Steckley, told CNN this week. ”She’s just maturing. We all do. As she matures and starts to grow, she realizes what she hasn’t done and what she has done and she kind of puts it together in a nice package now where she’s able to accept and take control.  ”She took things a little bit too seriously before and put a bit too much pressure on herself. I think she’s just loosened up a lot. She’s enjoying the moment and trying to figure out from there how to keep trying to get better.  ”And with each milestone I think she accomplishes, she gains more confidence and realizes that this is finally happening and that she belongs.” Ivanovic    contesting her first grand slam semifinal since the 2008 French Open    started much the stronger. While she was sharp, though, Safarova committed a flurry of unforced errors.  Ivanovic paid the price, however, for not capitalizing when she held two break points at  . Then leading   she wouldn’t win another game in the first, striking two double faults at   to trail for the first time. Clutch serving rescued Safarova at   in the second and a deflated Ivanovic was broken in the ensuing game.  They moved along until a dramatic 10th game.  Serving for the match at   Safarova hit three double faults, one on match point. The crowd, wanting a third set, roared with delight as Ivanovic leveled. But their joy was  .  Safarova quickly broke back and on her second attempt got the job done, sealing the contest with an   forehand before dropping to the clay. Playing in the women’s doubles semifinals Friday, she won’t have a day off.  ”I will try to just really enjoy it and relax,” said Safarova.  The men take center stage Friday. Novak Djokovic seeks to build on the momentum he garnered after handing   champion Rafael Nadal only his second French Open loss in 72 matches Wednesday. The world No. 1 meets Andy Murray, who he has topped on seven straight occasions. Both men are unbeaten on clay this season.

"Square’s Stock Jumps on Sales, then Crashes on Losses","Square, Inc. stock popped when its mobile payment service crushed   sales expectations on March 9  —   but then plunged as the company racked up a    losses. [Square and troubled Twitter have the same CEO, Jack Dorsey, and both have spent the vast majority of their public market experience below the price of their first day of trading.  Breitbart News has extensively documented Obama bundler Chris Sacca’s Board of Directors’ coup last summer that fired popular Twitter CEO Dick Costolo and brought back founder Dorsey. With the company throttling  commentary from conservative celebrities like Breitbart Tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos  —   who has 120, 000 Twitter followers  —   Twitter has tanked from the #3 worldwide social media darling to #9. Square posted quarterly revenue of $374 million from October to December 2015. That was up 49 percent from the same time in 2014, and about 10 percent above the $343 million average revenue prediction by Wall Street analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. Square CEO Jack Dorsey, in an   call to investors, trumpeted, “We’re off to a great start with   financial results that demonstrate both high growth and strong operating performance. ” He added that the company had completed more than $10. 2 billion in transactions for the quarter. But despite a great revenue boost  in its strongest seasonal quarter, the company lost $80. 5 million, or 34 cents a share for the quarter. That was more than double the $37. 1 million loss from a year ago. A big reason for the stunningly large loss was what the company calls “certain   expenses. ” That is financial gobbledygook for Square guaranteeing its venture capital investors that they would make a 20 percent profit when the company went public, no matter what early stage investors paid for private shares before the initial public offering. Referred to in Silicon Valley as a “ratchet” feature, Square Inc. VC investors that paid $15. 46 a share for Square private stock in 2014 received an option against a future “ ” of funding. When Square went public in November at $9 a share, VC investors faced a 29 percent loss. But through the magic of a “ratchet” guarantee, Square Inc. issued each VC shareholder a free extra 1. 15 shares of Square. Just like a magician saying “presto,” the VC investors’ 29 percent loss became a 20 percent profit. T real loser in this “      ” alchemy is the public that bought stock that popped up 45 percent to $13. 07 on the November first day of trading after the initial public offering (IPO). Massive dilution from free “ratchet” shares diluted the holdings of unsuspecting public buyers and Square’s stock price crashed down to the $8 range. The shares are still only trading at $11. 44 a share after the    sales revenue report. Jack Dorsey has said he is confident that he can juggle the CEO duties for the two companies, adding that Square and Twitter are just across the street from each other in San Francisco. But both Square and Twitter public shareholders do not seem to be enjoying juggling all the bad news."
The Big Nasty: Trump Rips Hillary’s ’Enabling’ Bill Questions ’Fauxcahontas’ Warren’s Indian Cred - Breitbart,"  Trump is once again raising former President Bill Clinton’s marital infidelities, a preview of how the billionaire businessman is likely to respond to   attacks from Democratic   Hillary Clinton and her allies about his treatment of women. [Trump is receiving criticism, too, from within his own party as some   Republicans say they won’t vote for him even though he has all but secured the nomination. Asked about his ability to unify the GOP, Trump is repeating his view that he doesn’t think it has to be unified and that he will gain Democratic votes to win in the fall.  “I think it would be better if it were unified, I think it would be  —   there would be something good about it,” Trump said in an interview with ABC’s “This Week” airing Sunday. “But I don’t think it actually has to be unified in the traditional sense. ” While speaking at a pair of rallies in Washington state on Saturday, Trump repeatedly assailed the woman he’s dubbed “Crooked Hillary” while hardly sparing former Republicans rivals Jeb Bush and Lindsey Graham repulsed by his chokehold on their party’s presidential nomination. “She’s married to a man who was the worst abuser of women in the history of politics,” Trump said of Clinton as he addressed supporters at the Spokane Convention Center just days after becoming the presumptive Republican nominee. Trump appeared to be responding to news that Priorities USA, the lead super PAC backing Clinton, has already reserved $91 million in television advertising that will start next month. Much of the negative advertising against Trump is expected to focus on belittling statements he’s made about women in the past. But Trump declared Saturday, “Two can play that game. ” “Hillary was an enabler and she treated these women horribly. Just remember this,” he said. “And some of these women were destroyed, not by him, but by the way that Hillary Clinton treated them after everything went down,” he said. At a later rally, in Lynden, not far from the Canadian border, Trump repeated the former president’s denial of a relationship with a White House intern that would later lead to his impeachment. “Do you remember the famous, ‘I did not have sex with that woman? ’” Trump asked. “And then a couple of months later, ‘I’m guilty.’ And she’s taking negative ads on me!” Deriding a culture of political correctness in which, he says, men are “petrified to speak to women anymore,” Trump also defended himself as a great supporter of women and sought to downplay past comments he’s made about women in venues like the Howard Stern radio show in the days before he was a politician. He said some were made in the name of entertainment, while others, like his criticism of actress and talk show host Rosie O’Donnell, were warranted. “Who the hell wouldn’t speak badly about Rosie O’Donnell? She’s terrible,” he said. Trump also continued a line of attack he rolled out on Friday evening in Oregon and on Twitter aimed at Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat and favorite of the left whom some would like to see as Clinton’s running mate. Trump repeatedly called Warren a “goofus” and suggested that she’d lied about her Native American background, an attack reminiscent of his insinuations that President Barack Obama was not born in the U. S. and demands that he produce a birth certificate. “She’s been going around pretending that she’s a minority,” said Trump, who alleged that Warren had made the claim “because she felt that her mother had high cheek bones. ” “Let’s see what she does when they say we want real proof that you’re a Native American,” he said. Warren had insulted Trump earlier on Twitter, calling him “a bully who has a single play in his playbook. ” Trump also unveiled new lines of attack against Clinton, calling her “trigger happy,” claiming her foreign policy decisions as secretary of state had cost the country millions of dollars and led to millions of deaths, and claiming that she wants to “abolish the Second Amendment” and “take your guns away. ” Clinton has said that the U. S. needs to rein in the notion that “anybody can have a gun, anywhere, anytime. ”"
This is the most amazing chart on Congress you’ll see today," (CNN) It’s no secret that Congress doesn’t get much done these days. And that partisanship and polarization are at record levels. Why? Well, lots of reasons. But this new chart via the Cook Political Report (a former employer of mine!) reveals a big part of the problem. What the chart shows is the almost complete disappearance of competitive House districts over the past two decades. In 1997, there were 164 congressional districts that performed somewhere between five points more Democratic and five points more Republican than the nation as a whole. In the 2016 election there were only 72 of those seats. (For more explanation of the Cook Report methodology on swing seats, check this out.) That’s 16. 5 percent of the entire House of Representatives who sit in potentially competitive districts. Why the change? Politicians    Democrats and Republicans    tasked in most states with crafting congressional lines once every decade    have prioritized protecting themselves over creating competitive districts. The 2001 and 2011 redistricting processes were hugely driven by a mission to draw   maps. Only in a handful of states    such as Iowa, which uses a nonpartisan entity to draw its congressional districts    do you see any sort of real competition. As the Cook Report’s  David Wasserman notes, however, redistricting isn’t the prime culprit for the decline of swing seats. The true ”blame” lies with something commonly referred to as  . Since 1997, we as a country have tended to prize living in and around people who share our views and values. No amount of   can change that fact. We have redistricted ourselves. The result is simple: There are very few members of Congress who have to spend any time reaching out to voters outside of their political base. The real danger for more than 80 percent of House members is a challenge from someone in their own party.   In our current political environment, there is not only no reward for working across the aisle, but there is also a known penalty: The possibility of losing a primary to a challenger who claims you are insufficiently loyal to the conservative or liberal cause. (There’s also the fact that a number of outside groups    most notably Club for Growth and Heritage Action on the right    help fund these insurgent challenges and have a decent track record of ousting incumbents who stray.) Politicians, ever concerned with survival, typically take the path of least resistance    voting with their party almost all the time. And it’s hard to argue why they should do anything else given the underlying partisanship of their seats. The solution?   redistricting in all 50 states designed to draw compact and sensible districts with no concern for incumbents’ wishes and wants. Chances of that happening? Same chance as me dunking a basketball at age 41.  So, zero."
Southern Cities Split With States on Social Issues - The New York Times,"JACKSON, Miss.  —   It was not that long ago that Victoria Fortenberry figured she would mark her 18th birthday by getting on a bus and getting out of Mississippi. But here she was,   tattooed and 19 years old, singing at a party for a new line of craft beer to a crowd that included her girlfriend. Ms. Fortenberry came here to attend a Christian college and found a place where she could be unashamedly Southern and openly gay in a way not possible in her conservative suburban hometown, or even in the Jackson of a decade ago. And so: “At some point,” she said, “I decided I won’t just leave. ” Jackson may not register nationally as an outpost of bohemianism or urbane liberalism. But its city government, which is majority black and Democratic, refuses to fly the   state flag at municipal buildings, and this month voted unanimously to oppose a new state law that creates special legal protections for opponents of   marriage. And it has a place for   singers  —   and their girlfriends. Jackson is among a group of Southern cities from Dallas to Durham, N. C. where the digital commons, economic growth and a rising cohort of millennials have helped remake the culture. Many of these cities have found themselves increasingly at odds with their states, and here in a region that remains the most conservative in the country, the conflicts are growing more frequent and particularly pitched. Fights are raging over gay rights here and in North Carolina, where a new law limits transgender bathroom access and   local governments from passing their own   ordinances. The resistance has been fierce in North Carolina, where companies have called off expansion plans and Ringo Starr and Bruce Springsteen have canceled concerts. The potential consequences of these boycotts point up the complications, though: In a South dominated by the politics of rural and suburban conservatives, a canceled rock concert or technology project is likely to punish the places that oppose the legislation, and have little effect on the areas that support it. “We’ve got this divide,” said Ferrel Guillory, the director of the Program on Public Life at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “The divide between the cultural conservatism of older suburbs and older rural areas, and these new, thriving, modern economy, diverse cities. ” The skirmishes over gay rights are only part of the growing rift between Southern cities, with their mostly Democratic municipal governments, and Southern state legislatures, which have come to be dominated by Republicans. Lawmakers in Alabama recently blocked cities from setting their own minimum wages, while Charlotte and Jackson have fought with the states over control of their airports. North Carolina’s Republican legislature has redrawn city council districts and tried to stop municipalities from becoming “sanctuary cities” for immigrants. The Arkansas and Tennessee legislatures have passed laws that, like North Carolina’s, ban local   ordinances that differ from state law. This version of a civil war even extends to the Civil War. Alabama is considering a law that would prevent local jurisdictions from removing Confederate symbols without state approval. Similar efforts were proposed but have so far failed in Virginia and Louisiana. But Southern cities have pushed back with vigor. Birmingham tried to go forward with a minimum wage law even after the state made it clear it would be overruled. Several cities in Arkansas passed   ordinances despite the state law that was meant to ban them. Across Mississippi, cities, counties and public institutions have responded to the Legislature’s unwillingness to take the Confederate battle cross out of the state flag by refusing to fly the flag altogether. For decades, the cultural gap between Southern cities and cities on the East and West Coasts has been narrowing to the point where the cultural riches of a place like Oxford, Miss.  —   with its literary scene and high end regional cuisine  —   are almost taken for granted. But commerce and the Internet have pushed global sophistication into new frontiers. In Starkville, Miss. an unassuming college town that Oxford sophisticates deride with the ironic nickname “StarkVegas,” a coffee bar called   serves an affogato prepared with espresso from Intelligentsia, the vaunted artisanal coffee brand. With these cultural markers have come expressions of unblushing liberalism that would have been unthinkable a decade ago. In January, Bernie Sanders drew thousands to a rally in Birmingham, Ala. Last June, after the Supreme Court affirmed the right to   marriage, the city government in Knoxville, Tenn. lit up a bridge in rainbow colors. The result has been a kind of overlapping series of secessions, with states trying to safeguard themselves from national cultural trends and federal mandates, and cities increasingly trying to carve out their own places within the states. All of this exasperates conservative lawmakers like State Senator Bart Hester, an Arkansas Republican, who says he is constantly playing defense against a rapidly changing culture. “Ten years ago, no one would have ever imagined someone would have deserved protections under civil rights because they didn’t know what gender they were,” he said. His biggest frustrations, he continued, are dealing with municipalities, on everything from gay rights to taxes. “It just shocks me every day how different our opinions and basic core values are,” he said. Fourteen of the 20   metro areas in the nation between 2010 and 2015 were in the South, according to an analysis of census data by the Institute for Southern Studies. That boom has not been driven by heavy industry, but by banking, insurance, health care and, increasingly, technology. Mr. Guillory, at the University of North Carolina, noted that the companies fueling the booms are often national or global, and cannot afford to brook sentiments that even begin to smack of bigotry. “It isn’t that these cities are elevating New Deal liberalism,” he said. “It’s much more of a cultural political liberalism. It’s a different kind of mixture. ” At a rally on Wednesday at the Mississippi state Capitol, thousands came in on church buses from around the state to hear the Rev. Franklin Graham, the evangelist, inveigh against   marriage and secularism. Greg Smith, 64, who had come to the rally from Tylertown, did not see any fundamental change in the fact that many Mississippians, even some Republican mayors, had come out against the new law. They just feared losing out on the almighty dollar, he said. “I think the state’s basically conservative, but we’ve let money become our god,” Mr. Smith said. Melvin Priester Jr. a member of the Jackson City Council, did not agree. “It’s a completely different world,” he said, recalling how he returned home several years ago to find artists and musicians not all that different from friends in his adopted San Francisco. “Technology has ended the isolation. ” Mr. Priester, who is black, also described how gay communities in Deep South cities have steadily gained allies among urban black leaders, many of whom had traditionally been skeptical of the gay rights movement. In Greensboro, N. C. Sharon Hightower, an   council member, joined in an    vote recently for a resolution condemning the state law limiting bathroom access. “We know what it’s like to be discriminated against,” she said. Still, many evangelical blacks remain hesitant to support the gamut of socially liberal causes. And indeed even some of the trendiest Southern cities have a strong traditionalist streak. The city of Chattanooga, a hub of tech activity, handily rejected an ordinance establishing domestic partner benefits in 2014 Houston voted three times for an openly gay mayor, and then last fall voted overwhelmingly against a broad   ordinance. But with liberals still outnumbered in most parts of the South, some worry that the boycotts and concert cancellations by opponents of certain state laws will end up doing the most economic harm to those who despise those laws. “The people who would go to those shows from a few hours away now aren’t going to go to the restaurants, or go to the bar and drink craft beer,” said Grayson Haver Currin, an editor of a North Carolina alternative weekly. He and his wife, Tina, recently started a website encouraging artists to keep their commitments in the state, but to donate proceeds to gay rights groups. On Monday afternoon in Raleigh, Carla Merritt, a transgender woman who has felt happy and accepted in this city, watched as hundreds of evangelicals  —   whom she called “the real country folk”  —   staged a boisterous rally on the Capitol lawn in favor of the new law that includes the provision limiting transgender bathroom access. Two days later, Ms. Merritt, over lunch at a downtown cafe, said she regretted using the words “country folk. ” “That sounded bigoted,” she said, “and I certainly didn’t mean it that way. ” That evening, the Currins were in front of the residence of Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, directing protesters who were blowing air horns to object to the new law. The Currins called it their “Air Horn Orchestra”  —   a piercing clamor of defiance that doubled, they said, as a homage to the   composers they love."

’Star Wars’ universe gets its first gay character," (CNN) If you feel a ripple in the Force today, it may be the news that the official Star Wars universe is getting its first gay character. According to the   website Big Shiny Robot, the upcoming novel ”Lords of the Sith” will feature a capable but flawed Imperial official named Moff Mors who ”also happens to be a lesbian.” The character is the first gay figure in the official Star Wars universe    the movies, television shows, comics and books approved by Star Wars franchise owner Disney    according to Shelly Shapiro, editor of ”Star Wars” books at Random House imprint Del Rey Books. It’s not entirely unprecedented a previous Star Wars book series and a few video games have featured gay relationships. But those characters aren’t considered to be part of the ”official” ”Star Wars” world outlined by Disney last year. Opinion: Is Disney ready for a gay princess? The new character is part of that world, and none too soon, Shapiro said. ”There’s a lot of diversity there should be diversity in ’Star Wars,’ ” she told Big Shiny Robot. ”You have all these different species, and it would be silly to not also recognize that there’s a lot of diversity in humans.” Except there hasn’t always been a lot of diversity in ”Star Wars.” The franchise, one of the biggest in all of science fiction, featured an   main cast for its first film and has been criticized for a lack of prominent female, minority and gay roles. The series did eventually add Billy Dee Williams in the role of Lando Calrissian, and minority actors played a bigger role in the prequel films. For instance, Samuel L. Jackson played Jedi Master Mace Windu, and Jimmy Smits had a role as Princess Leia’s adoptive father, Bail Organa. Just a few months ago, black actor John Boyega appeared as a stormtrooper in a trailer for the upcoming ”Star Wars” film, a decision met with some controversy. Two other black actors also have roles in the film. A couple of ”Star Wars” video games have included references to gay relationships. A 2007 novel also included a gay couple, but for many fans, neither the video games nor the ”extended universe” novels were part of what they considered to be the official ”Star Wars” universe. Disney, which now owns the ”Star Wars” franchise, endorsed that view last year, sweeping all the old novels, video games and other materials into a side room and slapping a ”Legends” tag on them. Only the six movies, the animated ”Clone Wars” and ”Star Wars Rebels” series and stories published since the change are considered ”canon.” And although we don’t know much about the storyline of the new movie, due out late this year, there’s been no mention of a gay character, giving top billing to the ”Lords of the Sith” appearance for fans excited by the inclusion of a lesbian character in a heretofore uniformly straight universe. The news was met with excitement, skepticism and some concern. ”Very excited about the recent #StarWars news,” Twitter user BlueJaigEyes said. A Twitter user called vilinder wrote, ”tough Star Wars getting a canonical lesbian character is extremely cool!” But, as you might expect, not everyone was so thrilled. A common refrain: What difference does sexuality make? ”Response I have is why should the sexual (preference) matter to character building?” one Twitter user asked."
"Ninth Circuit Denounces Donald Trump’s Refugee Orders, Says Not Justified - Breitbart","The   U. S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit said Monday that President Donald Trump’s March 9 executive immigration order on refugees is unconstitutionally vague. [The   decision declared that President Trump must justify his policies in court by citing agency recommendations and that he cannot unilaterally curb the annual inflow of refugees from 100, 000 to 50, 000 even though prior presidents have raised and lowered the annual inflow of refugees without interference from the judges.  “Immigration, even for the President, is not a   show,” the judges declared in their   decision, tiled  continuing: The President’s authority is subject to certain statutory and constitutional restraints. We conclude that the President, in issuing the Executive Order, exceeded the scope of the authority delegated to him by Congress. In suspending the entry of more than 180 million nationals from six countries, suspending the entry of all refugees, and reducing the cap on the admission of refugees from 110, 000 to 50, 000 for the 2017 fiscal year, the President did not meet the essential precondition to exercising his delegated authority: The President must make a sufficient finding that the entry of these classes of people would be “detrimental to the interests of the United States. ” Further, the Order runs afoul of other provisions of the INA that prohibit   discrimination and require the President to follow a specific process when setting the annual cap on the admission of refugees. Throughout their decision, the three judges  —   all of whom were appointed by former President Bill Clinton —   insisted that the President needs to justify his immigration decisions, including the March 2017 Executive Order, dubbed “EO2“ by detailing the reasons why migrants or refugees should be excluded despite the impossibility of predicting future behavior based on incomplete records and flexible, hidden personal views.  The lawsuit is titled “State of Hawaii: Ismail elShikh vs Donald J. Trump. The case was brought by an Egyptian immigrant cleric based in Hawaii, who claimed Trump’s policy could block his old    from moving to Hawaii. The claim was supported by the ACLU, Islamist groups, and many elite lawyers.  The decision by the California judges will either be approved or rejected by the Supreme Court, as soon as the fall. Much of the executive order was already blocked by another group of progressive judges in Virginia, who claimed that it is unconstitutional because of Trump’s   criticism of Islam. The California court did not bring up Trump’s campaign comments or claim religious animus, but repeatedly emphasized that Trump needs support from agency reports and the courts before he can rewrite the nation’s immigration policies. To justify its claim for a greater bureaucratic and judicial role in national immigration policy, the court had to deal with a 1952 law giving the president   authority over immigration policy. According to the court: In the INA of 1952, Congress delegated some of its power to the President through Section 212( f) which provides: Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. In response, the court argues that: “Section 1182( f) [of the law] requires that the President find that the entry of a class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States,” adding: Section 1182( f) [of the law] requires that the President find that the entry of a class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. This section requres that the President’s findings support the conclusion that entry of all nationals from the six designated countries, all refugees, and refugees in excess of 50, 000 would be harmful to the national interest. There is no sufficient finding in EO2 that the entry of the excluded classes would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. Also, the president has not produced documents from the bureaucracies to back up his decisions, says the court: There is no finding that present vetting standards are inadequate, and no finding that absent the improved vetting procedures there likely will be harm to our national interests. These identified reasons do not support the conclusion that the entry of nationals from the six designated countries would be harmful to our national interests. The president has not explained in detail why groups of refugees or individual migrants from the six target nations should be excluded, the court declares. The Order does not tie these nationals in any way to terrorist organizations within the six designated countries. It does not identify these nationals as contributors to active conflict or as those responsible for insecure country conditions. It does not provide any link between an individual’s nationality and their propensity to commit terrorism or their inherent dangerousness. In short, the Order does not provide a rationale explaining why permitting entry of nationals from the six designated countries under current protocols would be detrimental to the interests of the United States   …     In conclusion, the Order does not offer a sufficient justification to suspend the entry of more than 180 million people on the basis of nationality. National security is not a “talismanic incantation” that, once invoked, can support any and all exercise of executive power under § 1182( f). The court also relied on President Barack Obama’s judgment that upping the inflow of refugees to 110, 000 a year is safe, saying: President Obama previously determined that the admission of 110, 000 refugees to the United States during fiscal year 2017 was justified by humanitarian concerns or otherwise in the national interest  …     To the extent that 60, 000 additional refugees can be considered a class of aliens, EO2 makes no findings to justify barring entry in excess of 50, 000 as detrimental to the interests of the United States. EO2 gives no explanation for why the 50, 001st to the 110, 000th refugee would be harmful to the national interest, nor does it specify any further threat to national security. And there is not any rationale explaining why the previous target admission of 110, 000 refugees this fiscal year was justified by humanitarian concerns or otherwise in the national interest, see 8 U. S. C. § 1157( a)(2) but that the entry of more than 50, 000 refugees this same fiscal year would be detrimental to the national interest. Here too, the President did not meet the statutory precondition of exercising his authority under § 1182( f) to cap refugee admissions. The decision is found here."
"Gov. Christie Signs Bill to Put Armed, Retired Cops in Schools","New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (R) has signed legislation that will allow schools and colleges to hire armed, retired police officers to serve as security to protect students and teachers alike. [Christie’s signature comes during the very week in which a Somali refugee drove a car into a group of pedestrians, then chased unarmed students with a knife at Ohio State University.  According to NJ. com, the legislation, S86, allows schools and colleges to hire retired police officers as “special law enforcement officers. ” Christie “conditionally vetoed” S86 two months ago because the first version did not require the retired officers to undergo “specialized training covering security issues that routinely arise in the school setting. ” He explained the veto, saying, “It is vital to ensure that the officer is integrated into the unique setting of a school community and is properly trained to function not only as a safety expert and law enforcer, but also as a liaison to community resources, educators and counselors. ” The necessary changes were made to S86 and the Boston Herald reports that Christie signed it, saying: The safety of our children is of paramount concern, especially in the wake of senseless violent attacks in the very places that students and teachers should feel safest. This legislation creates an affordable option for all New Jersey communities to provide security in their schools with properly trained officers who have decades of experience. It allows existing police officers to keep our streets and neighborhoods safe. Campus carry and other forms of legislation to arm teachers in public schools have gained momentum throughout the country since 20 students and six unarmed staff members were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012. Christie’s signature on S86 is a reflection of this momentum and of the understanding that defenseless students and unarmed teachers are sitting ducks.

Families of Terror Attack Victims Sue Twitter for ’Providing Resources and Services to ISIS’ - Breitbart,"The family members of three Americans killed by Islamic State attacks in France and Belgium are suing social media company Twitter, claiming that the company failed in its responsibility to prevent terrorist organisations from utilising their platform. [Business Insider reports that a lawsuit filed on January 8th in New York states claims Twitter has played “a uniquely essential role in the development of ISIS’s image, its success in recruiting members from around the world, and its ability to carry out attacks and intimidate its enemies. ” Attorneys for the families stated that Twitter has potentially violated the   Act and seek “compensatory damages in amounts to be determined at trial. ”  The suit alleges that Twitter has “continued to provide these resources and services to ISIS and its affiliates, refusing to actively identify ISIS Twitter accounts, and only reviewing accounts reported by other Twitter users. ” It further says, “Simply put, ISIS uses Twitter as a tool and a weapon of terrorism,” This is not the first time that Twitter has been accused of allowing terrorist organisations to use their platform as a means of communication and recruitment. The family of a    former Florida sheriff killed while providing police training in the Middle East sued Twitter in January 2016, claiming that the company “knowingly permitted” ISIS accounts to spread extremist propaganda. In June 2016, the father of a victim of the Paris terrorist attacks sued Facebook, Google, and Twitter for allegedly allowing terrorists to   via their platforms.

"New Saudi King’s big challenges: Yemen, Iran and ISIS"," (CNN) King Salman of Saudi Arabia has inherited the throne from his older brother and with it a host of pressing challenges in a turbulent region. To the south, Yemen is in chaos. To the north, the militant group ISIS is wreaking havoc in Iraq and Syria. More broadly, Saudi Arabia remains locked in a regional cold war with Iran. Within the kingdom’s borders, Salman has to decide how to pace sensitive reforms while keeping a lid on extremism.  The stakes are high in one of the leading regional powers in the Middle East and a key U. S. ally. ”Saudi Arabia has been critical to preserving some degree of regional stability in the face of a growing Iranian threat, during the rise of Islamic extremism that followed the U. S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and during the new wave of upheavals that began in the spring of 2011,” Anthony H. Cordesman, a Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in a commentary this month. Here are some of the main challenges Salman now faces: Yemen, The new king has been plunged straight into the deep end with a   crisis on Saudi Arabia’s southern border. The   government in Yemen has crumbled amid sectarian unrest. The country’s president and prime minister resigned Thursday night after a move by Shiite Houthi rebels to gain power in the capital in recent days. Sunni majority Saudi Arabia, which provides energy and financial support to Yemen and shares a long border with it, is looking on with growing anxiety, fearful of the prospect of another   state in the region. ”This will terrify the Saudis, just as the Shia uprising in Bahrain did,” said CNN intelligence and security analyst Bob Baer. ”Saudi Arabia, all these years, has avoided sending troops into Yemen. It’s a quagmire for the Saudis,” said Baer. ”They’ve got a reinforced border and they’ve put a lot of troops down there. But, still, they are panicking.” Mohammed Albasha, a spokesman for the Yemeni Embassy in Washington, told CNN on Wednesday that without Saudi support, ”Yemen will become a failed state.” It’s not far from that already. The poorest country in the region, Yemen is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which U. S. officials consider to be the most dangerous branch of the terrorist network, according to CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank. Iran, The Yemen crisis feeds into a broader issue for Saudi Arabia: the growing influence of Iran in the region. Yemeni officials have frequently accused Iran of providing financial support and weapons to the Houthis in an effort to control Yemen’s Red Sea coast, on one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. ”That makes Saudi Arabia very uncomfortable,” said CNN global affairs analyst Bobby Ghosh. ”Saudi Arabia, a Sunni majority country, regards   Iran as a mortal enemy. Both are facing each other off in a bizarre game of chess they’re playing across the Arab world.” Tensions have simmered between Tehran and Riyadh at least as far back as Iran’s Islamic Revolution in 1979. The conflict in Syria has been viewed as a proxy conflict between the two, with Iran supporting the regime of President Bashar   and Saudi Arabia helping rebel groups. But the rise of the ISIS extremists amid the relentless bloodshed of the Syrian war has complicated the equation. ”There are signs by the Saudis and the Iranians that it is in their interests to   tensions to confront ISIS,” said Harith   a fellow at Harvard’s Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. ”But it’s impossible to move from hostility to alliance quickly.  ”Although the two sides realize that ISIS is a threat to some extent to both of them, they don’t think it is so big a threat as to move that fast to cooperation,” he said in November. ISIS, The bloodthirsty seizure of large swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq by ISIS has created a major headache in the region for the Saudis. And the attempts of ISIS leader Abu Bakr   to style himself as spiritual leader of Muslims presents a challenge to the Saudi monarchy, which is responsible for Islam’s two holiest cities, Mecca and Medina. ”The Saudis fear it as a potential domestic threat, turning Salafism into a revolutionary political ideology rather than the   bulwark it has usually been in Saudi Arabia,” says F. Gregory Gause, III, a senior foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution in Doha, Qatar.  Saudi Arabia is considered to be a key U. S. ally in the fight against ISIS. One of Salman’s sons, Prince Khaled, was reportedly among the pilots who carried out the first airstrikes on ISIS positions in Syria last year.  But Salman also has some responsibility for Saudi Arabia’s backing of jihadist fighters in previous conflicts, according to David Andrew Weinberg, a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ”Salman played a significant role in the 1980s and 1990s gathering support in the royal family for mujahedeen holy warriors in places like Afghanistan, places like the Balkans,” Weinberg told CNN. ”A number of these Afghan and Balkan veterans have in fact come back to Saudi Arabia and sown continued radicalism.” The Saudi government, though, has denied ever providing support to ISIS, which is a splinter group of al Qaeda. Internal reform, Salman’s predecessor, King Abdullah, is credited with managing to ride out the ructions of the Arab Spring that swept away other Arab rulers. But with a fast growing population in an unstable region, the royal family has no room for complacency. ”Saudi Arabia has faced, and will face, constant challenges in finding the pace of modernization and reform that pushes forward as fast as possible while retaining Saudi popular support, meeting Saudi Arabia’s unique religious and cultural needs, and ensuring that evolution will not turn into either regression or revolution,” said Cordesman. ”As events in other parts of the region since 2011 have shown all too clearly, it is easy to get things terribly wrong and very hard to keep them going right,” he wrote. While some observers have applauded Abdullah’s cautious reforms, others say he moved too slowly. ”If you look at where Saudi Arabia is today, it hasn’t actually moved that far from when he assumed the throne in 2005,” Weinberg told CNN. The monarchy needs to allow greater freedoms for women, improve the rights of the Shiite minority, modernize the education system and give greater powers to elected bodies, according to Cordesman. With the recent sharp drop in oil prices, officials will have to chart a careful course for the economy. Saudi Arabia depends heavily on oil revenues to fund its government.  ”Above all, the Saudi government needs to ensure that its rapidly growing population will have meaningful jobs and futures,” Cordesman said."
DHS Report: More than 800 people wrongly given US citizenship,"Washington (CNN) At least 858 people that had been ordered deported or removed under another name were improperly granted US citizenship due to a failure to maintain adequate fingerprint records, according to a new report. The failure occurred, in part, because older fingerprint records were not digitized as part of DHS or the FBI fingerprint databases and therefore could not be readily searched thereby preventing those who had been ordered deported or removed from being identified.  The Department of Homeland Security Inspector General report said there are still ”about 148, 000 older fingerprint records that have not been digitized of aliens with final deportation orders or who are criminals or fugitives.” Failure to digitize these records risks ”making naturalization decisions without complete information and, as a result, naturalizing additional individuals who may be ineligible for citizenship or who may be trying to obtain US citizenship fraudulently,” the report added. ”US Citizenship and Immigration Services granted US citizenship to at least 858 individuals from special interest countries who had been ordered deported or removed under another name,” according to the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General report. The report describes special interest countries as ”generally defined as countries that are of concern to the national security of the United States.”  At least one of the people identified as having improperly been granted citizenship is now working in law enforcement, the report said. It recommends the remaining older fingerprint records be digitized and that DHS review ”the eligibility of each naturalized citizen whose fingerprint records reveal deportation orders under a different identity” and decide whether to seek denaturalization. The report noted that the department has concurred with its recommendations and has begun implementing corrective actions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Neema Hakim told CNN that ”DHS is and has been taking steps to address this issue” including working to digitize the   fingerprint records. But Hakim added, ”The fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization, or that the applicant obtained naturalization fraudulently.” ”Where the DHS review process finds that naturalization was obtained fraudulently, DHS will appropriately refer the case to the Department of Justice for civil or criminal proceedings, including for denaturalization,” Hakim said.  ”This failure represents a significant risk to America’s national security as these naturalized individuals have access to serve in positions of public trust and the ability to obtain security clearances,” Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, wrote in an open letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson.  Failure to properly screen applicants for US citizenship, particularly from ”special interest countries,” is likely to further fuel controversy over the screening of immigrants, a contentious topic during the 2016 election cycle. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has called for immigration bans targeted at countries with connections to terrorism. He had previously called for a temporary prohibition of Muslim immigrants.  The apprehension of Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspected perpetrator of the recent bombings in New York and New Jersey, is similarly likely to draw attention to the screening process as Rahami immigrated to the US from Afghanistan and subsequently was granted US citizenship. "
The Election Highlighted a Growing Rural-Urban Split - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump fared very poorly in American cities in Tuesday’s election. Hillary Clinton did just as badly among rural voters. The political divide between the two groups has been growing more stark in America for years, and 2016 showed an even sharper split than 2012. Multiple forces are pulling the American geography apart, as the   and   suburbs remain the contested political ground in between. The election reinforces the feeling that the prosperity of many metropolitan areas is not shared by the rest of the country. Mr. Trump made no real play for urban voters, despite living and running businesses in their midst. He went so far as to depict them as dystopias, a strategy that has long helped Republicans stoke enthusiasm among voters outside cities. And so it is little surprise that the urban counties that include Austin, Tex. Chicago Los Angeles Oakland, Calif. Portland, Ore. Seattle Denver and Newark voted for the Republican candidate in this election in   numbers. Mr. Trump’s own Manhattan gave him just 10 percent, a new nadir for a G. O. P. presidential candidate in the borough. His    home, Washington, gave him just 4 percent. Most of the change, though, occurred not around the big cities  —   where Democratic candidates have only so many votes left to pick up  —   but far outside them. Just 15 counties tilted by more than five percentage points in favor of Mrs. Clinton relative to how they voted in 2012. By contrast, 1, 826 moved by at least that much away from the Democratic candidate. The counties that swung the most drastically toward Mr. Trump, by 15 points or more, were nearly all in the Midwest. That abrupt shift was probably driven by numerous factors that are hard to untangle: weak economic prospects Mrs. Clinton’s lack of attention to those places on the campaign trail Mr. Trump’s xenophobic message to voters anxious about change. But the widening political divergence between cities and   America also reflects a growing alienation between the two groups, and a sense  —   perhaps accurate  —   that their fates are not connected. The University of Wisconsin political scientist Katherine J. Cramer, the author of “The Politics of Resentment,” described what this looked like during years of field research in Wisconsin in an insightful interview with Jeff Guo at The Washington Post. The people she met across a state that Mrs. Clinton ultimately lost felt deeply disrespected (and suspicious of a   academic from   Madison). “They would say, ‘The real kicker is that people in the city don’t understand us,’ ” Ms. Cramer said. “ ‘They don’t understand what rural life is like, what’s important to us and what challenges that we’re facing. They think we’re a bunch of redneck racists.’ ” Cities, for their part, are easily branded with some dissonance as embodying either professional elites or poor people who don’t deserve benefits (thus both Madison and Milwaukee, two very different places, come in for equal resentment within Wisconsin). Many of the young Democratic voters who live in blue cities like these, as Alec MacGillis has noted, have gravitated away from redder parts of the country from which they felt alienated. “There’s just nothing to do in Ohio,” lamented one voter who grew up there but now lives in Los Angeles. “The jobs are limited, but it’s not just the jobs and the industries that are in Ohio, it’s the   that I didn’t gravitate to. ” As the relationship between density and partisanship has grown stronger over the last   the structure of the economy has also changed in ways that reinforce the divide. At the height of Detroit’s auto industry in the early 1950s, the C. E. O. of General Motors, Charles Wilson, memorably pronounced that what was good for the country was good for his company, and vice versa. That’s no longer true of the major industries in big American cities (or the people who work for them) argues Aaron Renn, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. G. M. had trouble selling cars when the national economy was bad. Its customer base depended on a stable middle class far from Detroit. That’s not true today of Facebook, or Google, or Goldman Sachs, Mr. Renn says. They don’t rely on dealers all over the country. Their bottom lines aren’t tied to material prosperity in   Wisconsin. “In a sense, the   economy in these urban areas is disconnected from the success from the rest of the country,” Mr. Renn said. And the very things that drive success in Silicon Valley’s tech industry, or New York City’s financial sector, are what worries rural America: globalization, foreign trade, immigration. “Goldman Sachs and Google do not really need America to be a     success in order for them to be personally successful. ” Those economic forces will probably grow only stronger, even as the effects of an election that pushed urban and rural America further apart recede."
The Republican Senate majority may be on the verge of collapse,"’’ ’The 2016 map always looked good for Democrats.’ ’But if Donald Trump or Ted Cruz is at the top of the GOP ticket, it looks freaking great for them.’ ’The 2014 midterm was nothing short of a disaster for Democrats, a combination of a dismal map,   Obama fatigue and shoddy recruitment, that ultimately cost Democrats the Senate and netted Republicans nine seats from North Carolina to Colorado.’ ”In 2016, the tables were expected to turn even before Trump emerged. Now things have gone from bad to awful for Republicans’ Senate hopes.” ’”It creates lots of problems and headaches for Republicans, and Democrats firmly believe that it is going to be a train wreck unlike anything seen in a long time,” says Cook Political Report analyst Jennifer Duffy. ”I have Democrats talking to me about 8 to 10 seats. I am not there yet. ”’ ’In 2016, Democrats only have 10 seats to hold on to. Republicans, meanwhile, have 24 —  seven in states Obama won in both 2008 and 2012. And unlike a midterm election where turnout is anemic and older white voters call the shots, the presidential race is expected to bring more minority and young voters out to to polls.’ ”Kyle Kondik, a congressional race analyst at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, breaks it down into three categories. There are the hardest seats for Republicans to hold onto; Wisconsin and Illinois, which have trended further to the left in recent years. Then there are races that are more truly   places like Florida, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Ohio where a presidential race could swing the state one way or the other. And, finally there are a new slew of seats that could be up for grabs if Republicans select a presidential nominee like Trump or Cruz.” ’Since the cycle started, Democrats have bet they could net four or five seats with a specific eye on Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Illinois and Florida, but the prospect of Cruz or Trump on the top of the ticket is making them more bullish.’ ’Now, Democrats are seriously looking at expanding their map to North Carolina, Missouri, Arizona, Indiana and even Iowa —  states with strong incumbents once viewed as hard to knock off. In Iowa, Democrats successfully recruited former state agricultural secretary and lieutenant Gov. Patty Judge to challenge   incumbent Sen. Chuck Grassley.’ ”Grassley has regularly been   with more than 60 percent of the vote, but he appears more vulnerable than in years past both because of the prospect of a Trump nomination and in part because of his intransigence as the Senate’s Judiciary Committee chairman to move forward President Obama’s Supreme Court Justice nominee Merrick Garland.” ’’ ’In Arizona, not only is Sen. John McCain fighting off a primary challenge to his right, early polls indicate Democratic challenger Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick is a formidable foe.  released this month showed McCain and Kirkpatrick tied at 42 percent among registered voters in the state.’ ”Republicans are generally regarded of having a crop of strong candidates heading into 2016 unlike in 2012 when a slew of primary insurgent conservatives’ blunders cost Republicans the Senate. And their candidates have by and large taken their races seriously, investing time and energy in early fundraising. Yet, it may not matter for pragmatic policy makers like Sens. Rob Portman ( ) or Pat Toomey ( ). Sometimes (as we saw in 2014) a wave is just too much.” ’”All the money in the world is not worth what a good presidential candidate would be worth,” said Kyle Kondik, political analyst at the University of Virginia. ”The members who pay the price for extremism at the top of the ticket are not the extreme members. ”’ ”In recent weeks, both the Cook Political Report and the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics have moved several Senate races in Democrats’ direction.” ’”Considering the rise of Donald Trump, the polarization in U. S. politics, and a higher rate of   voting, this could be bad news for the GOP,” a team of analysts at the UVA Center for Politics wrote earlier this month when they moved Senate races in Iowa, Pennsylvania, Colorado, North Carolina, Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania in the Democrats’’ direction.’ ’But the more Democrats can win in 2016 the better insulated they will be for the 2018 midterm elections when they face another terrible, no good, Senate map where Democratic senators from North Dakota to West Virginia face  .’ ’”They really need to run up the score this year,” Kondik said.’ ’The 2016 map always looked good for Democrats. ..’"
Members of militia group charged with plotting to bomb Kansas apartment complex and mosque day after presidential election,"’  ’ ’   Three men were arrested on Friday in connection with a plot to   bomb a Kansas apartment complex and mosque, federal officials   said ’ ’   Curtis Allen, Gavin Wright, and Patrick Stein face a charge of   conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction to detonate bombs   at an apartment complex in Garden City, Kansas, where Somali   immigrants live and worship, a statement from the US Justice   Department said. ’ ’   ”The attack was planned for the day after election day,” US   Attorney Tom Beall said in a   press conference. ’ ’   The men planned to release a manifesto they hoped would “wake   people up,” Beall said. The three men were part of a militia that   referred to itself as the Crusaders, investigators said. ’ ’   The Council on   Relations responded to the   charges, asking the federal government to step up protections for   mosques. ’ ’’ ’   ”Given this alleged plan to attack a Kansas mosque, the two other   hate incidents reported today against Islamic institutions in   Michigan and New Jersey, and the overall spike in     incidents nationwide, state and federal authorities should offer     protection to local communities,” executive director,   Nihad Awad, said in an emailed statement to Business Insider. ’ ’   ”We ask our nation’’s political leaders, and particularly   political candidates, to reject the growing Islamophobia in our   nation,” he added. ’ ’   The FBI had been tracking the men since February as part of an     investigation that revealed a ”hidden culture of   hatred and violence,” Beall said. ’ ’   The men’s plot appeared to be premeditated as they conducted   surveillance on potential targets and stockpiled firearms and   ammunition, federal officials said. ’ ’   If convicted of the terror plot, the suspects could face a   maximum sentence of life in prison.  ’ ’   Revelations of the possible attack come amid a   heated presidential election in which Republican candidate Donald   Trump has made incendiary remarks about immigrants, and has vowed   to impose a  from entering the US.  ’ ’   Earlier this year a  found a total of 78 violent   attacks occurred at mosques in 2015  —   up from 34 in   2014. The organization has been tracking the incidents   since 2009 and said the number of attacks in 2016 could make   it  on record.  ’ ’     Curtis Allen and Gavin Wright, both 49, and of Liberal, Kansas,     and Patrick Eugene Stein, 47, of Wright, Kansas, appeared in     federal court to face a charge of conspiring to use a weapon of     mass destruction (explosives) in connection with their plot to     detonate bombs at an apartment complex in Garden City, Kansas     where Somali immigrants live and worship.   ’ ’     The announcement was made by Assistant Attorney General for     National Security John P. Carlin and Acting U. S. Attorney Tom     Beall of the District of Kansas.   ’ ’     “According to the complaint, these three defendants conspired     to conduct a bombing attack against an apartment complex     occupied by men, women and children in the Garden City, Kansas     community,” said Assistant Attorney General Carlin. “Protecting     our nation from such attacks, whether they are rooted in     domestic or international terrorism, is our highest priority. ”   ’ ’     “These charges are based on eight months of investigation by     the FBI that is alleged to have taken the investigators deep     into a hidden culture of hatred and violence,” said Acting U. S.     Attorney Beall. “Many Kansans may find it as startling as I do     that such things could happen here. ”   ’ ’     The complaint alleges that since February the FBI has been     investigating the defendants’ activities, including their plans     to carry out a violent attack against Muslims in southwestern     Kansas. The defendants were key members of a militia group that     referred to itself as the Crusaders. A confidential source     attended meetings of the group and provided the FBI with     information about the defendants’ activities.   ’ ’     The criminal complaint alleges that the men conducted     surveillance to identify potential targets, stockpiled     firearms, ammunition and explosive components, and planned to     issue a manifesto in conjunction with the planned bombing. The     attack, the defendants said, would be intended to “wake people     up. ”   ’ ’     After considering possible targets, the defendants decided to     conduct the attack on a Garden City, Kansas apartment complex     that houses a mosque and a large number of members of the     Somali community. They discussed obtaining four vehicles,     filling them with explosives and parking them at the four     corners of the apartment complex to create a large explosion.   ’ ’     On Oct. 12, Stein met with an undercover FBI employee in rural     Finney County, Kansas. After examining and test firing     automatic weapons, Stein took the source to see the apartment     building that the defendants were targeting in Garden City,     Kansas. Stein said he would provide ammonium nitrate for the     bomb and contribute $200 to $300 for other materials.   ’ ’     Stein also talked with the undercover employee about defendant     Allen’s arrest in a domestic violence case in Liberal, Kansas     the previous day, Oct. 11.

Can Evolution Have a ‘Higher Purpose’? - The New York Times,"About 25 years ago, a conversation between me and one of the greatest biologists of the 20th century took a weird turn. I was talking to William D. Hamilton, who was famous for coming up with the theory of “kin selection,” which explains patterns of altruism among close relatives in various species, including ours. This and other seminal ideas had earned Hamilton a place in the pantheon of thinkers who ushered in the modern Darwinian understanding of social behavior. Richard Dawkins, in the preface to his landmark 1976 book,“The Selfish Gene,” paid tribute to Hamilton and the three other “dominant figures” in social biology whose ideas formed the book’s foundation. I was interviewing Hamilton at the University of Michigan, where he was on sabbatical from Oxford. A video camera was rolling. I had been researching a book about evolutionary psychology, and I was hoping to create a documentary on the subject. The documentary never materialized, and Hamilton died in early 2000. My interview with him sat unwatched until earlier this year, when I tracked down the tape containing it. During the interview, I was trying to steer Hamilton toward philosophical topics, and at one point he went further than I had expected. He said, “I’m also quite open to the view that there is some kind of ultimate good which is of a religious nature  —   that we just have to look beyond what the evolutionary theory tells us and accept promptings of what ultimate good is, coming from some other source. ” That’s an unusual thing for a great evolutionary biologist to say, but the most unusual part was still to come. Hamilton continued, in his British accent, “I could enlarge on that in terms of the possible existence of extraterrestrial manipulators who interfere, and so on, but I think this would be getting too far from the general topic of discussion. ” Well, maybe, but this sounded at least as interesting as the general topic of discussion. I asked him if he meant that there was some kind of “transcendental purpose” that we humans are generally oblivious to. He answered: “Yes, yes. There’s one theory of the universe that I rather like  —   I accept it in an almost joking spirit  —   and that is that Planet Earth in our solar system is a kind of zoo for extraterrestrial beings who dwell out there somewhere. And this is the best, the most interesting experiment they could set up: to set up the evolution on Planet Earth going in such a way that it would produce these really interesting characters  —   humans who go around doing things  —   and they watch their experiment, interfering hardly at all so that almost everything we do comes out according to the laws of nature. But every now and then they see something which doesn’t look quite right  —   this zoo is going to kill itself off if they let you do this or that. ” So, he continued, these extraterrestrials “insert a finger and just change some little thing. And maybe those are the miracles which the religious people like to so emphasize. ” He reiterated: “I put it forward in an almost joking spirit. But I think it’s a kind of hypothesis that’s very, very hard to dismiss. ” The headline almost writes itself: “  Scientist Says Miracles Can Happen!” The subhead would add: “Extraterrestrials may play a role. ” But that’s the headline you’d write if you were just trying to maximize clicks. If you wanted to capture the philosophical significance of what Hamilton was saying, you’d take another tack. Rather than focus on miracles, you’d focus on the idea of “higher purpose”  —   the idea that there’s some point to life on earth that emanates from something that is in some sense beyond it. And  —   in hopes of generating as many clicks as possible, notwithstanding the philosophical significance  —   you’d put this in listicle form, laying out several misconceptions that Hamilton had implicitly dispelled. You could call these the “Three Great Myths About Evolution and Purpose. ” Myth number one: To say that there’s in some sense a “higher purpose” means there are “spooky forces” at work. When I ask scientifically minded people if they think life on earth may have some larger purpose, they typically say no. If I ask them to explain their view, it often turns out that they think that answering yes would mean departing from a scientific worldview  —   embracing the possibility of supernatural beings or, at the very least, of immaterial factors that lie beyond scientific measurement. But Hamilton’s thought experiment shows that this isn’t necessarily so. You may consider aliens spooky, but they’re not a spooky force. And they’re not supernatural beings. They’re just physical beings, like us. Their technology is so advanced that their interventions might seem miraculous to us  —   as various smartphone apps would seem to my      —   but these interventions would in fact comply with the laws of science. More to the point: If you ask how Hamilton’s aliens had initially imparted “purpose” to life, the answer is that they did so in concrete fashion: by planting simple   material on earth a few billion years ago, confident that it would lead to something that would keep them entertained (keeping them entertained being, in this scenario, life’s purpose). Which leads to: Myth number two: To say that evolution has a purpose is to say that it is driven by something other than natural selection.  The correction of this misconception is in some ways just a corollary of the correction of the first misconception, but it’s worth spelling out: Evolution can have a purpose even if it is a wholly mechanical, material process  —   that is, even if its sole engine is natural selection. After all, clocks have purposes  —   to keep time, a purpose imparted by clockmakers  —   and they’re wholly mechanical. Of course, to suggest that evolution involves the unfolding of some purpose is to suggest that evolution has in some sense been heading somewhere  —   namely, toward the realization of its purpose. Which leads to: Myth number three: Evolution couldn’t have a purpose, because it doesn’t have a direction. The idea that evolution is fundamentally directionless is widespread, in part because one great popularizer of evolution, Stephen Jay Gould, worked hard to leave that impression. As I and others have argued, Gould was at best misleading on this point. And, anyway, even Gould admitted that, yes, on balance evolution tends to create beings of greater and greater complexity. A number of evolutionary biologists would go further and say that evolution was likely, given long enough, to create animals as intelligent as us. In fact, that idea is implicit in Hamilton’s saying the aliens could have “set up” evolution in such a way that “it would produce these really interesting characters  —   humans. ” This part of Hamilton’s scenario requires no intervention on the part of the aliens, because he believed that evolution by natural selection has a kind of direction in the sense that it is likely, given long enough, to produce very intelligent forms of life. (When speaking more precisely, as he did in other parts of the interview, Hamilton would say that the human species per se wasn’t in the cards  —   that it wasn’t inevitable that the first intelligent species would look like us.) With these three myths dispelled, you’re left with this philosophically liberating upshot: You can entertain the possibility that evolution has a purpose, a kind of goal (a “telos,” as philosophers say) without departing from a strictly Darwinian view of evolution  —   without abandoning belief in natural selection as evolution’s only engine, and without surrendering your credentials as a modern, scientifically minded kind of person. In case you’re still feeling a little uneasy about becoming a purpose ponderer, I should emphasize that not all teleological scenarios that pass scientific muster involve space aliens. Indeed, some scientists have suggested that natural selection has a purpose that wasn’t instilled by any kind of intelligent being. This scenario emerges from one version of physicist Lee Smolin’s theory of “cosmological natural selection. ” Smolin thinks our universe may itself be a product of a kind of evolution: maybe universes can replicate themselves via black holes, so over time  —   over a lot of time  —   you get universes whose physical laws are more and more conducive to replication. (So that’s why our universe is so good at   making!) In some variants of Smolin’s theory  —   such as those developed by the late cosmologist Edward Harrison and the mathematician Louis Crane  —   intelligent beings can play a role in this replication once their technology reaches a point where they can produce black holes. So through cosmological natural selection you’d get universes whose physical properties were more and more conducive to the evolution of intelligent life. This might explain the   observation that the physical constants of this universe seem “ ” to permit the emergence of life. Crane, in a recent dialogue on my website meaningoflife. tv, told me that in this scenario “human life —  and I don’t mean on an individual scale, but as a whole —  has a purpose in the same sense that a chicken’s egg has a purpose. The purpose of a chicken’s egg is to create a chicken. ” Crane isn’t using language carelessly here. Some philosophers are comfortable talking about animals having a “purpose” imbued by natural selection (to spread their genes). So if biological evolution is a product of cosmological natural selection, it has a purpose in a defensible sense of that term —  and we’re part of that purpose. So add another item to our listicle: Myth number four: If evolution has a purpose, the purpose must have been imbued by an intelligent being.  That said, one interesting feature of current discourse is a growing openness among some scientifically minded people to the possibility that our world has a purpose that was imparted by an intelligent being. I’m referring to “simulation” scenarios, which hold that our seemingly tangible world is actually a kind of projection emanating from some sort of   powerful computer and the history of our universe, including evolution on this planet, is the unfolding of a computer algorithm whose author must be pretty bright. You may scoff, but in 2003 the philosopher Nick Bostrom of Oxford University published a paper laying out reasons to think that we are pretty likely to be living in a simulation. And the simulation hypothesis has gained influential supporters. Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium and America’s de facto astronomer laureate, finds it plausible. The visionary tech entrepreneur Elon Musk says there’s almost no chance that we’re living in “base reality. ” The New Yorker reported earlier this year that “two tech billionaires”  —   it didn’t say whether Musk is one of them  —   “have gone so far as to secretly engage scientists to work on breaking us out of the simulation. ” I’m guessing that will take awhile, and meanwhile I’d like to note an irony. When an argument for higher purpose is put this way  —   that is, when it doesn’t involve the phrase “higher purpose” and, further, is cast more as a technological scenario than a metaphysical one  —   it is considered intellectually respectable. I don’t mean there aren’t plenty of people who dismiss it. I’m talking about how people dismiss it. The Bostrom paper drew flack, but a lot of it was from people who thought the chances that we’re living in a simulation are way less than 50 percent, not from people who thought the idea was wholly crazy. If you walked up to the same people who gave Bostrom a respectful hearing and told them there is a transcendent God, many would dismiss the idea out of hand. Yet the simulation hypothesis is a God hypothesis: An intelligence of   power created our universe for reasons we can speculate about but can’t entirely fathom. And, assuming this intelligence still exists, it is in some sense outside of our reality  —   beyond the reach of our senses  —   and yet, presumably, it has the power to intervene in our world. Theology has entered “secular” discourse under another name. Personally, I’m fine with that. I think discussion of higher purpose should be respectable even in a scientific age. I don’t mean I buy the simulation scenario in particular, or the space alien scenario, or the cosmological natural selection scenario. But I do think there’s reason to suspect that there’s some point to this exercise we Earthlings are engaged in, some purpose imbued by something  —   and that, even if identifying that something is for now hopeless, there are grounds for speculating about what the point of the exercise is. I won’t elaborate much on this, since I’ve done that elsewhere, arguing that higher purpose can be framed as a hypothesis, and that evidence for or against the hypothesis can be marshaled. But I will say that the evidence I see for purpose includes not just the direction of biological evolution, but the direction of technological evolution and of the broader social and cultural evolution it drives  —   the evolution that has carried us from   bands to the brink of a cohesive global community. And if the purpose involves sustaining this direction  —   becoming a true global community  —   then it would seem to include moral progress. In particular, our purpose would involve transcending the psychology of tribalism that can otherwise divide people along ethnic, national, religious and ideological lines. Which would mean  —   in light of recent political and social developments in the United States and abroad  —   that our work is cut out for us."
What the Election Means for the Markets - The New York Times,"What will happen to financial markets after the election? More so than usual, we have a decent idea. That’s because there has been a clear and identifiable swing in a variety of asset prices  —   especially the stock market and currencies  —   at inflection points in the presidential race. A stock market rally on Monday is the latest evidence. The more than 2 percent gain in the Standard  Poor’s 500 appears to be linked to the announcement on Sunday by James Comey, the F. B. I. director, that an examination of newly discovered Hillary Clinton’s emails revealed nothing  warranting charges. Market swings over the course of the election suggest that people and institutions with money on the line view a world with Mrs. Clinton as president offering a less volatile economic and financial environment than one with Donald J. Trump in charge. It’s a risky game to try to tie swings in financial markets to political news. Markets often rise and fall for reasons that have nothing to do with the day’s biggest headlines. And if Monday’s rally were a   occurrence, it would be safer to attribute it to random chance than to the market’s collective judgment of the future under the two potential presidents. But in this election cycle, there has been a clear pattern in which the odds shifted in the race and different financial indicators moved in a consistent direction. Good news for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has coincided with higher stock prices, a rally in the Mexican peso and a decline in expected stock market volatility. Good news for Mr. Trump has coincided with the reverse swings. (The impact on the value of the dollar and Treasury bonds has been more ambiguous.) That movement was evident when audio emerged of Mr. Trump making vulgar comments about women and Mrs. Clinton had strong debate performances. It went in the opposite direction when Mr. Comey indicated on Oct. 28 that investigators were examining newly obtained emails tied to Mrs. Clinton. An analysis around the first debate by the economists Justin Wolfers and Eric Zitzewitz found that the coinciding movements between Mrs. Clinton’s odds and market prices implied that Mr. Trump’s winning would lead to a 10 to 15 percent drop in major stock markets and substantial drops in the price of oil and the Mexican currency, combined with higher volatility. (Mr. Wolfers is a contributor to The Upshot). Stock market analysts agree on the direction of the likely movements in the event of a Trump win, if not their magnitude. In a research note Monday, Evercore I. S. I. interpreted the evidence as signaling that a Trump win would create a drop of 5 to 6 percent in stocks, with a 2 percent gain if Mrs. Clinton wins. Citigroup analysts see a drop of 3 to 5 percent. “A Democratic sweep could cause investors and corporate leaders to worry about higher taxes and regulation,” wrote Ethan Harris, global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “A Trump win could have an even greater impact due to uncertainty about how campaign promises translate into policies,” particularly around the risk of trade wars. Even if estimates like those correctly predict the   market reaction to the election, their ability to correctly judge the   consequences of a political shift for the economy and the business environment isn’t particularly good. Complex feedback loops among political decisions, public policy and the economy aren’t always evident in the immediate aftermath of elections or referendums. The June 23 vote by British voters to leave the European Union is a prime example. In the days just after the vote, the British stock market fell sharply, as did the country’s currency. In the weeks that followed, the stock market largely rebounded, as there was no evident damage to British companies’ profitability and the cheaper pound made shares of those companies a bargain. British stocks are now higher than they were the day of the vote, as measured by the FTSE 100 index. The pound has fallen further. Similarly, a Trump win would set in motion shifts that market analysts can only guess at. Even if the stock market dropped as analysts are forecasting, that might make the Federal Reserve less likely to raise interest rates at its December meeting, and low rates tend to strengthen asset prices. And investors would surely start to game out which companies stood to gain the most from Mr. Trump’s promises of a lower corporate income tax rate and lighter regulation  —   and which could suffer from less availability of immigrant labor. Fundamentally, the tone from economic and market analysts is that they don’t know exactly how Mr. Trump would govern. Nor do they know the composition of the new Congress and how it would deal with a Clinton or Trump administration. “The impact of an initial Trump shock to financial conditions would depend on whether the shock was persistent or not, which in turn is likely to depend importantly on which Trump shows up,” wrote Krishna Guha of Evercore ISI, casting a President Trump as either “the angry populist of the campaign trail or the   but ultimately pragmatic New York  . ” (Mr. Guha views a pragmatic Trump as the more probable outcome.) A victory by Mrs. Clinton would most likely signal continuity with President Obama’s policies and fewer radical shifts. But there, too, the details would ultimately shape the fate of markets, and some of those are unknowable, like whether she would find willing partners to enact pieces of her agenda or would face steadfast resistance from Congress. In other words, think of the market reaction on Wednesday as a response to one mystery being solved (who won) while another one is created (how that person will lead)."
The last armed conflict in Latin America is finally ending," (CNN) A conflict that lasted over five decades. An estimated 220, 000 people killed. Five million displaced.   These staggering figures are now consigned to history as the Colombian government buries the hatchet with its longtime nemesis, the Marxist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia rebel group, better known by its Spanish acronym, FARC.  In a symbolic gesture, the pens used to sign the historic peace deal, years in the making, have been made from recycled bullets once used in the conflict. An inscription on the side of the pens reads: ”Bullets wrote our past. Education, our future.” The two sides, joined by leaders from the United States, Mexico, El Salvador, Uruguay, Cuba and the United Nations, came together on Monday in the coastal colonial city of Cartagena to sign the accord. ”Today, Colombians are bidding farewell to decades of flames, and sending up a bright flare of hope that illuminates the entire world,” UN   Ban   said at the signing ceremony.  The rebels voted unanimously to approve a deal that was finalized in August to end the    conflict, Latin America’s  .  It still needs to be ratified by voters, who will consider the agreement in a   referendum on October 2. The treaty, signed by President Juan Manuel Santos and FARC leader Rodrigo Londoño, better known as Timochenko, requires rebels to give up their weapons and participate in a transitional justice process toward reintegration.  Opinion: United States should embrace a changing Latin America, New political era, If and when the deal is approved by the electorate, the FARC will cease to be a rebel group and instead enter into politics as a   party.  The treaty grants the FARC 10 political seats, but it remains to be seen whether the rebel group, founded on Marxist ideologies of class struggle, can effectively transition into a political platform.  While the deal symbolizes a chance for future generations to come of age in peace, the deal also signals a new chapter for the region. The   war in the Americas will finally be over, bringing an end to armed political conflict in Latin America.  However, not all groups are bound by the peace deal. The second most powerful group following the FARC, the National Liberation Army, or ELN, has announced interest in the peace deal but refused to end its practice of kidnapping. Colombia’s FARC rebels release child soldiers, End of an era for armed conflict in Latin America, Latin America has slowly been freeing itself from the shadows of the Cold War as countries such as Colombia, Guatemala, Bolivia and Chile    with the help of the United States    fought off rebel guerillas.  ”Across the region, the Cold War is over,” said Cynthia Arnson, director of the Latin America Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Now, ”Guerrilla war is no longer seen as a reasonable way to contest power.”  The FARC started in 1964 and, like its mentors in Cuba, was committed to redistributing the wealth, even if it meant by force.  But half a century later, now funded by a sophisticated cocaine trafficking network and armed with child soldiers, the rallying cries to protect an agrarian society begin to sound antiquated and obsolete.  According to Arnson, public approval for the FARC has never polled more than 5%.   but still untrusting, For Jorge Bermudez, a retiree in Bogota, the peace deal is good in theory, but he remains wary. ”I don’t think the agreement will become a reality because dealing with people who have killed so many children, that have maimed people and suddenly they are in government . .. how will this country end up with such people?” he told CNN Español.  Salud Hernandez, who has been a correspondent in Colombia for the daily newspaper El Mundo since 1999, has reasons to have ill faith in the FARC. Hernandez has covered this war extensively and was kidnapped herself this year by the ELN, in May.   ”Even speaking with the guerrilla fighters, they can’t hide that what they have done for the last 52 years is massacre, kidnappings and extortion,” she said in an interview with CNN Español’s Fernando Ramos while covering the final FARC conference last week.  ”This is a group that didn’t have the popular support practically and that has summoned the country to countless tragedies.”  A leading crusader against the peace deal is former President Alvaro Uribe Velez, whose father was killed by the FARC. He accused Santos of having ”accepted all of the FARC’s agenda.”  ”To this terrorist group, they also give impunity, and political legitimacy to all its actors, including those responsible for massacres (and) the most severe offenses, and crimes against humanity,” he said in a video posted to Twitter in August.  Deal lives or dies on amnesty, Meanwhile, FARC leaders press that there is no peace without amnesty.  Ivan Marquez, the group’s chief negotiator, told CNN en Español, ”Without this law, well, it is very difficult for the guerrillas to begin their movement into the peace zones or to the transitional points for normalization.”  As world leaders cheer the historic signing of a peace deal that ends the longest running war in the Americas, the rest of the peace process is now in the hands of Colombians.

Police in Tulsa fatally shot an unarmed black man,"’  ’ ’   TULSA, Okla. (AP)  —   A Tulsa police officer shot and killed a   black man who ignored repeated requests to put up his hands   before reaching into an SUV that was stalled in the middle of a   street, the police department said. ’ ’   Terrence Crutcher, 40, died at the hospital where he was taken   after he was shot by the officer at around 8 p. m. Friday, police   said in a news release. ’ ’   Police spokeswoman Jeanne MacKenzie earlier told reporters that   two officers were walking toward the stalled SUV when Crutcher   approached them from the side of the road. ’ ’   ”He refused to follow commands given by the officers,” MacKenzie   said. ”They continued to talk to him, he continued not to listen   and follow any commands. As they got closer to the vehicle, he   reached inside the vehicle and at that time there was a Taser   deployment and a short time later there was one shot fired.” ’ ”   MacKenzie said that as of 9 p. m. police hadn’t searched the SUV   and didn’t know if there was a weapon inside. ” ’’ ’   MacKenzie did not immediately respond to phone messages left   Saturday seeking further information. ’ ”   The officers’ names and races weren’t released. The one who shot   Crutcher will be placed on leave, which is routine in cases of     shootings. The county district attorney’s office   will determine if the shooting was justified, MacKenzie said   Friday. ” ’   Online court records show Terrence Crutcher of Tulsa with the   same date of birth as the man who was shot pleaded no contest in   1996 to carrying a concealed weapon and resisting an officer and   was given a   suspended sentence. ’ ’   His only other court records were for traffic violations, the   most recent occurring in 2005. ’ ”   Tulsa police officers don’t currently have   cameras,   although they were selected to receive a nearly $600, 000     grant for them in 2015. ” ”   MacKenzie said she believes the officers’ dash cameras might have   captured video of the shooting. ” ”   In April, a white reserve Tulsa County sheriff’s deputy was   convicted of manslaughter in the fatal shooting last year of an   unarmed black suspect who was on the ground being restrained by   officers. The deputy said he mistook his handgun for a stun gun. ” ’   The shooting led to an investigation that resulted in misdemeanor   charges against the county sheriff, who resigned and later   pleaded no contest a charge of refusal to perform official duty   and guilty to willful violation of the law. ’"
An insane 5 minutes in the playoffs may have affected Kevin Durant’s decision and changed the NBA forever,"’  ’ ’   Years from now, Game 6 of the 2016 Western Conference Finals   between the Golden State Warriors and Oklahoma City Thunder may   not be remembered as a pivotal turning point in NBA history, but   its effect could be felt for years. ’ ’   After  that game is looking more and more like a crucial   moment in laying out the current NBA landscape. ’ ”   Game 6 was supposed to be the Warriors’ funeral and the Thunder’s   arrival. The Warriors were trailing the Thunder   in the series   and facing elimination for the second straight game. Despite    while facing elimination   at home, Game 6 was taking place in front of a raucous Oklahoma   City crowd, where the Warriors had just been pummeled in Games 3   and 4. ” ”   And for much of the game, it looked like the   Warriors   wouldn’t even make it back to the Finals. While it was a close   game, the Thunder held a slight edge, continuing to stifle the   Warriors in the paint while outworking them on offense. ” ”   With five minutes to go, after Kevin Durant knocked down a   jumper, the Thunder led  . That’s when Klay Thompson  —   who   had been having a monstrous game,   keeping the   Warriors in it with a bevy of difficult, contested      —   nailed a deep   to quell the Thunder. It marked a   strange atmospheric shift in the game. ” ’ ’ ’   Those final five minutes saw the entire series reverse course.   The Thunder became stagnant and tentative, while the Warriors,   playing for their lives, became the aggressors. Andre Iguodala,   acting as a   defensive Swiss army knife, got key stops on   Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. One strip of Westbrook led to   what became the dagger three from Thompson. ’ ’ ’ ’   Another stop by the Warriors led to a Stephen Curry layup to put   the Warriors up five and seal the win. ’ ’   In those final five minutes, the Thunder went    from the   field with six turnovers. Though it simply evened up the series,   they breathed life into the Warriors, much in the same way the   . ’ ’  ’ ”   The Warriors won Game 7 in Oakland, returning to the Finals while   breaking Oklahoma City’s collective heart. Three times the   Thunder had the chance to put away the Warriors and couldn’t. ” ”   Following Durant’s decision to join the Warriors,  that the final five minutes of Game 6   were so crazy that Warriors general manager Bob Myers immediately   rewatched them just to try to process what happened. ” ’   ”I never do that,” Myers told Lowe. ”I just wanted to see what   happened. I didn’’t understand it. I still don’’t.” ’ ’   Lowe wrote: ’ ”   There’s no guarantee that a trip to the Finals would have changed   Kevin Durant’s decision, but it’s fair to argue that it may have   affected it. It would be difficult to leave a team who just   returned to the Finals for the first time since 2011. It would be   even tougher to do so if the Thunder had won the Finals. ” ’   Had the Thunder won the championship, the ripple effect across   the league would be huge. A few things that would have possibly   changed: ’ ”   This doesn’t include the multitude of events that have yet to   unfold in the wake of Durant’s decision. For instance, how teams   will go about building their rosters to overcome this monster in   the bay. The   construction is alive and well, and, on   paper, the NBA looks more   than ever. ” ”   None of these are guarantees  —   perhaps the Cavaliers would have   beaten the Thunder in seven games. Perhaps they would have swept   them. Perhaps Durant would have left Oklahoma City even after   winning the championship. It’s all unknown. ” ”   But collapsing to the Warriors only reinforced the fact that it   will never be easy for Durant in Oklahoma City. Failing to close   them out three times in a row made room for doubt to creep in.   That Game 6 was the Thunder’s best chance to get over the hump   and return to the Finals, and they couldn’t do it. ” ”   That group of Warriors players that tore apart the Thunder as   we’ve known them are now Durant’s teammates. Together, they’ve   formed a   unlike anything the NBA has ever seen. ”"
"Mike Huckabee stands by Josh Duggar, family","Washington (CNN) Mike Huckabee is standing by the Duggar family following the admission by eldest son Joshua Duggar that he committed ”inexcusable” actions as a teenager, amid a shocking report outlining multiple allegations of child molestation against him. ”Josh’s actions when he was an underage teen are as he described them himself, ’inexcusable,’ but that doesn’t mean ’unforgivable,’” Huckabee wrote in a Facebook post. ”He and his family dealt with it and were honest and open about it with the victims and the authorities. No purpose whatsoever is served by those who are now trying to discredit Josh or his family by sensationalizing the story.” Huckabee said that ”good people make mistakes and do regrettable and even disgusting things,” and accused those who revealed the allegations of ”insensitive bloodthirst,” and said Josh Duggar had redeemed himself in living a ”responsible and circumspect life as an adult.” A police report published by In Touch magazine on Thursday night outlined multiple allegations of child molestation by Josh Duggar, now 27, against underage girls that happened when he was 14 and 15 years old, and were reported to the Springdale police when he was 18. ”Twelve years ago, as a young teenager, I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret,” Josh Duggar said in a statement. ”I hurt others, including my family and close friends.” Duggar’s statement appears to refer to a 2006 police report in In Touch magazine’s story. The police report is heavily redacted and does not include the name of the person accused of ”forcible fondling,” but the dates listed in the document appear to line up with Duggar’s statement Thursday. The Springdale Police Department did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment. His admission could become a significant headache for Republican presidential contenders, many of whom have been outspoken supporters of the Christian conservative family in the past, and have received campaign support from the family. Late last night, Duggar also resigned as head of the lobbying arm of the conservative Family Research Council, a decision President Tony Perkins said in a statement was the ”best decision for Josh and his family at this time.” He also emphasized that the molestation allegations were ”previously unknown” to the organization. There’s no evidence to suggest any of the candidates who campaigned with the Duggars over the years had any knowledge of the report published this week.  The Duggars’ have a long and active history of political advocacy for social conservative causes, and were seen as powerful surrogates for Republican candidates over the years. As recently as Tuesday of this week, Josh Duggar tweeted a picture of himself with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who’s expected to launch his presidential bid next month. Within hours of the news breaking, critics of the Duggars had unearthed shots of him with a veritable panoply of declared and expected GOP presidential candidates, enough to fill a   Tumblr page. He’s been photographed smiling alongside Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. The Duggars also appeared in a photograph with former President Bill Clinton, who is also from Arkansas, when both the family and the former president were interviewed on NBC’s Today show in 2011.  And the Duggar family’s political activity doesn’t stop there  —   last cycle Josh Duggar alone campaigned for GOP Senate candidates in Kansas, Virginia and Mississippi. In 2008, they helped drive Huckabee to a win in the Iowa caucuses, where Evangelical Christians are a strong voting force in 2012 they did the same for Santorum. Huckabee at one point called the Duggars an ”example of something that’s wholesome and wonderful.” The police report also appears to show Josh’s parents, Jim Bob and Michelle, were aware of their son’s ”forcible fondling”  —   often while the girls were asleep  —   as early as 2002, but waited at least a year to take any action against him. Jim Bob Duggar initially said upon finding out about his actions, they sent their son to a ”Christian ministry” for some ”hard physical work and counseling,” but Michelle Duggar later revealed they simply sent him to stay with a family friend for a period of time.  A formal police investigation wasn’t opened until 2006, when the Duggars were due to make an appearance on Oprah Winfrey’s show and a tipster sent along a letter detailing some of the allegations, which the show forwarded to police. Duggar and his wife live in the Washington, D. C. area and are expecting their fourth child."
F.B.I. Director James Comey Recommends No Charges for Hillary Clinton on Email - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, on Tuesday recommended no criminal charges against Hillary Clinton for her handling of classified information while she was secretary of state, lifting an enormous legal cloud from her presidential campaign less than two hours before she boarded Air Force One for her first joint campaign appearance with President Obama. But on a day of political high drama in Washington, Mr. Comey rebuked Mrs. Clinton as being “extremely careless” in using a private email address and server. He raised questions about her judgment, contradicted statements she has made about her email practices, said it was possible that hostile foreign governments had gained access to her account, and declared that a person still employed by the government  —   Mrs. Clinton left the State Department in 2013  —   could have faced disciplinary action for doing what she did. To warrant a criminal charge, Mr. Comey said, there had to be evidence that Mrs. Clinton intentionally transmitted or willfully mishandled classified information. The F. B. I. found neither, and as a result, he said, “our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. ” The Justice Department is highly likely to accept the F. B. I. ’s guidance, which a law enforcement official said also cleared three top aides of Mrs. Clinton who were implicated in the case: Jake Sullivan, Huma Abedin and Cheryl D. Mills. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said last week that she would accept the recommendation of the F. B. I. and career prosecutors in the case after a storm of criticism about an impromptu meeting between her and former President Bill Clinton on an airport tarmac in Phoenix. Mr. Comey’s   announcement, delivered with no advance warning only three days after his investigators interviewed Mrs. Clinton in the case, riveted official Washington and is likely to reverberate for the rest of the campaign. In offices across the capital, all eyes turned to television screens to hear the outcome of a yearlong investigation that could have thrown the 2016 presidential election into disarray and changed history. As Mr. Comey strode to the lectern at the F. B. I. headquarters at 11 a. m. Mrs. Clinton was waiting backstage a few blocks away to address the National Education Association. Her aides said she did not know what Mr. Comey was going to say. Five minutes into Mr. Comey’s remarks, and before he announced that the F. B. I. would not seek charges, a smiling Mrs. Clinton began her speech. By 2:45 p. m. she and Mr. Obama were descending the stairs of Air Force One for a campaign rally in Charlotte, N. C. while back in Washington the State Department spokesman, John Kirby, was fending off questions from reporters about what Mr. Comey described as the department’s lax security in handling classified information. White House officials said Mr. Obama also did not know about Mr. Comey’s plans ahead of time. The F. B. I. director said he did not coordinate the statement with the Justice Department or any other agency. “They do not know what I am about to say,” he declared. A Republican former federal prosecutor, Mr. Comey seemed at first to be laying the groundwork for some kind of legal charge. Speaking sternly, and in far more detail than he usually does, he listed several previously undisclosed findings from the F. B. I. ’s investigation: ■ Of 30, 000 emails Mrs. Clinton handed over to the State Department, 110 contained information that was classified at the time she sent or received them. Of those, Mr. Comey said, “a very small number” bore markings that identified them as classified. This finding is at odds with Mrs. Clinton’s repeated assertions that none of the emails were classified at the time she sent or received them. The F. B. I. did not disclose the topics of the classified emails, but a number of the 110 are believed to have involved drone strikes. ■ The F. B. I. discovered “several thousand”   emails that were not in the original trove of 30, 000 turned over by Mrs. Clinton to the State Department. Three of those contained information that agencies have concluded was classified, though Mr. Comey said he did not believe Mrs. Clinton deliberately deleted or withheld them from investigators. ■ In saying that it was “possible” that hostile foreign governments had gained access to Mrs. Clinton’s personal account, Mr. Comey noted that she used her mobile device extensively while traveling outside the United States, including trips “in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. ” ■ Mrs. Clinton used multiple private servers for her personal and government business, not just a single server at her home in New York that has been the focus of media reporting for more than a year. Her use of these servers  —   some of which were taken out of service and stored  —   made the F. B. I. ’s job enormously complicated as it struggled to put together, in Mr. Comey’s words, a jigsaw puzzle with “millions of email fragments” in it. Despite all that, Mr. Comey said the F. B. I. did not find that Mrs. Clinton’s conduct revealed “intentional misconduct or indications of disloyalty to the United States or efforts to obstruct justice. ” But a person in her position, he said, “should have known that an unclassified system was no place” for the emails she was sending. And he said it raised troubling questions about how the State Department handled classified information. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, declined to comment, except to say it was clear from Mr. Comey’s remarks that “they’ve looked at this in excruciating detail. ” Mr. Obama, he said, remained “enthusiastic” about Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy. The Clinton campaign clearly hoped that the announcement would bring to a close a saga that has haunted Mrs. Clinton since March 2015, when the existence of her personal email account surfaced. “We are pleased that the career officials handling this case have determined that no further action by the department is appropriate,” said the campaign’s spokesman, Brian Fallon. “As the secretary has long said, it was a mistake to use her personal email and she would not do it again. We are glad that this matter is now resolved. ” Republicans seized on Mr. Comey’s sharp criticism, saying it raised doubts about Mrs. Clinton’s fitness for high office. Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, asserted in a post on Twitter that David H. Petraeus, the former C. I. A. director, had been charged for doing far less than Mrs. Clinton, and the lack of charges showed that the system was “rigged. ” In fact, F. B. I. officials have long said that what Mr. Petraeus did  —   knowingly handing a diary with classified information to his biographer and lover, then lying about it to investigators  —   was worse than what Mrs. Clinton did. In the Petraeus case, the F. B. I. recommended a felony indictment, but the Justice Department allowed him to plead to a misdemeanor. The deal that Mr. Petraeus received shadowed Mrs. Clinton’s case from the start because it appeared to set a higher bar for bringing charges against her. “In looking back at our investigations into the mishandling or removal of classified information,” Mr. Comey said, “we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. ” Congressional Republicans swiftly called for the F. B. I. to release more details about its findings. “If it wants to avoid giving the impression that the F. B. I. was pulling punches,” said Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, “the agency must now be more transparent than ever in releasing information. ” Speaker Paul D. Ryan was equally critical. “While I respect the professionals at the F. B. I. this announcement defies explanation,” he said in a Twitter post. “No one should be above the law. ” For an agency that seemed to be in no rush, the F. B. I. ’s investigation wrapped up quickly. By the time the investigators interviewed Mrs. Clinton in three and a half hours of questioning on Saturday, they had compiled months of findings. Mrs. Clinton appeared to say nothing to contradict what they had already discovered about how the private server was used, a law enforcement official said. The investigators then worked with Mr. Comey through the holiday weekend to review her testimony and determine whether there was any new information that might warrant criminal charges, law enforcement officials said. They found none. For weeks, F. B. I. agents expected the investigation would not yield charges. They shared Mr. Comey’s conclusion that Mrs. Clinton had showed poor judgment but that she had not committed a crime. In the spring, Mr. Comey declared that the campaign calendar would not dictate the pace of the investigation. But the Democratic National Convention begins on July 25 in Philadelphia, and F. B. I. officials did not want to be seen as influencing the outcome of the election after the nomination. Mr. Comey’s announcement was believed to be the first time that the F. B. I. had ever publicly disclosed its recommendations to the Justice Department about whether to charge someone in any   case, let alone a presidential candidate. His decision to announce the results of the investigation was made before the uproar over Ms. Lynch’s meeting with Mr. Clinton, according to a law enforcement official. He decided to make his findings public, the official said, because he wanted to make the F. B. I. ’s position clear before referring the case to the Justice Department. While the F. B. I. ’s recommendation spares Mrs. Clinton and her aides criminal charges, it does not remove the possibility that they could be denied security clearances if Mrs. Clinton is elected and she appoints them to jobs that require such clearance. The State Department plans to conduct its own administrative review after the Justice Department acts. “We don’t share the broad assessment made of our institution that there’s a lax culture here when it comes to protecting classified information,” said Mr. Kirby, the State Department spokesman. “We take it very, very seriously. ”"
Attkisson: ’Overwhelming Body of Evidence’ Benghazi Rescue Teams Turned Back - Breitbart,"Wednesday on Newsmax TV’s “The Steve Malzberg Show,” while discussing her Benghazi investigation “Full Measure,” host Sharyl Attkisson said there is now “overwhelming” evidence that rescue teams sent to aid the U. S. consulate in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012 had turned back before arriving.  Attkisson said, “We also spoke to sources and have some email evidence that talks about special forces that were not far away in Europe that we were told were assigned to respond in the event of a case just like this, and yet were turned back according to witnesses. This is something that the president and the White House has steadfastly denied, but there’s now what I would call an overwhelming body of evidence that leads us to believe that somebody stopped a number of teams and potential rescuers from entering Libya or going to Benghazi to help while those attacks were underway. They could have gotten there. According to experts and people that have information we spoke to, they could have gotten there before the last two Americans died. Those attacks went on for eight hours. ” She added “We spoke to, again a CIA team leader expert, an   expert who says the only person who stops those forces that spun up automatically without waiting to be told —  the only force is the commander in chief,  slash the White House, an authority that comes from him. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN"
"In Europe, Is Uber a Transportation Service or a Digital Platform? - The New York Times","Ever since Uber showed up in Europe in late 2011, the American   service has faced vocal opposition. Some of its drivers have been attacked by angry taxi drivers in Paris. Two of the company’s most senior European executives have stood trial on charges of running an illegal transportation service in France. And taxi associations from London to Frankfurt have accused Uber of flouting local rules and undermining European rivals. The company denies the accusations. These heated battles will culminate on Tuesday in arguments before the European Court of Justice, the region’s highest court, which will most likely determine how Uber can operate across the European Union, one of the company’s largest international markets. At stake is the   service’s often aggressive worldwide expansion. Uber has opened in more than 300 cities on six continents. That has helped the American tech company reach an   valuation of $68 billion, making it one of the most successful   ever to come out of Silicon Valley. Such rapid growth has often pitted Uber against traditional taxi services and local labor unions, which have accused the company of disregarding working standards and transportation rules. “We will fight against Uber in Germany and across Europe,” said Hermann Waldner, the head of a taxi dispatch center in Berlin. “We will try to do what we can to defend ourselves through the law. ” But as people increasingly turn to services like Uber and rivals like Lyft, policy makers worldwide are starting to question how such businesses in the   sharing economy should be governed. “Our role is to encourage a regulatory environment that allows new business models to develop,” Jyrki Katainen, the European Commission vice president for jobs, growth investment and competitiveness said this year, before adding that a critical priority was “protecting consumers and ensuring fair taxation and employment conditions. ” For Uber and its rivals in Europe, the court case represents a watershed moment for how   companies will be able to operate in the region. The hearing relates to a standoff between Uber and a Spanish taxi association, which filed legal proceedings in 2014, claiming unfair competition. Later that year, Uber suspended its services in the country, including its   UberPop offering, which had allowed almost anyone  —   after some basic security checks  —   to use the company’s platform to pick up passengers. Uber recently returned to Spain, this time in partnership with licensed taxi drivers. In July 2015, a judge in Barcelona referred the case to the European Court of Justice, asking the   court to determine whether Uber should be treated as a transportation service or merely as a digital platform. If the court decides that Uber is a transportation service, the company will have to obey Europe’s often onerous labor and safety rules, and comply with rules that apply to traditional taxi associations. Though Uber already fulfills such requirements in many European countries, the ruling could hamper its expansion plans. But if the judges rule that Uber is an “information society service,” or an online platform that merely matches independent drivers with potential passengers, then the company will have greater scope to offer   products like UberPop and other services that have been banned in many parts of Europe. “This case should show that European laws fully support the development of a digital single market,” Gareth Mead, an Uber spokesman, said in a statement, referring to efforts to reduce barriers that currently restrict the access Europeans have to digital content,   products and other online services. Asociación Profesional Élite Taxi, the Spanish group that brought the case, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. A ruling is not expected before March at the earliest. The judges may decide to consider Uber a transportation service, an online platform, or a combination of the two, further complicating the legal standoff. Other European taxi associations are keeping a close eye on the outcome, which will apply across the   bloc. “Uber is appealing to Europe at the very moment when Europe is starting to seize upon problems linked to the web,” said Séverine Bourlier, secretary general of the National Taxi Union in France. “You can sense that countries are worried, so I think Europe is starting to think about this problem and ways to regulate it. ” The future of Uber’s European operations has become increasingly important for the company since it sold its   Chinese unit this year to Didi Chuxing, a local rival, after a lengthy price war between the two companies. While Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, had targeted China for major expansion, the company settled for a minority stake in a combined Chinese operation with Didi Chuxing that is valued at roughly $35 billion. As Uber has grown beyond San Francisco, where it was founded in 2009, it has become embroiled in a number of legal disputes around the world that have challenged its business model and some of its working practices. Last month, for instance, New York State regulators ruled that two former Uber drivers were eligible for unemployment payments, finding that they should be treated as employees rather than independent contractors, as the service had maintained. A British court also recently made a similar ruling, saying that Uber drivers should receive a minimum wage and vacation pay. Mr. Kalanick has been charged in South Korea with running an illegal taxi service, an accusation the company denies, while in India, a former Uber driver was sentenced last year to life in prison for the rape of a passenger. Other   businesses like Airbnb, the vacation rental site, have also been targeted for legal action, particularly in Europe, where traditional hotels have viewed such competition with skepticism. Last week, the city government in Barcelona  —   one of Airbnb’s largest markets  —   fined the company and its rival, HomeAway, a combined $1. 2 million for advertising and operating vacation rentals without appropriate licenses. BlaBlaCar, a French   service, also was ordered to pay almost $10, 000 to Madrid’s regional authorities for operating without required authorization. The companies deny the allegations. Uber’s European legal woes have often set governments against one another, as countries have taken opposing views on how the company should operate. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, and countries like Finland and Portugal have supported such new digital services, often proposing new legislation to help them grow locally. But in other countries, notably France and Germany, national politicians have favored rules that have either banned some of Uber’s services or required the company to operate within existing transportation rules. “We’re focused on working within the regulatory environment,” said Andrew Pinnington, chief executive of MyTaxi, an Uber rival owned by Daimler, the German automaker. “We want to be seen as a constructive disrupter of the industry, not a destroyer of it. ”"

House Democrats Ask Devin Nunes to Recuse Himself From Russia Inquiry - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Top House Democrats on Monday called on the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee to recuse himself from the panel’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, thrusting the entire inquiry into jeopardy amid what they described as mounting evidence he was too close to President Trump to be impartial. The demands followed revelations that the committee’s chairman, Representative Devin Nunes of California, had met on White House grounds with a source who showed him secret American intelligence reports. The reports, Mr. Nunes said last week, showed that Mr. Trump or his closest associates may have been “incidentally” swept up in foreign surveillance by American spy agencies. The new revelation that the information actually came from a meeting held on the grounds of the White House intensified questions about what prompted Mr. Nunes to make the claim about the intelligence gathering, and who gave him the information. Representatives Adam B. Schiff of California, the committee’s top Democrat, and Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, suggested that Mr. Nunes, who served on the Trump transition team, was simply too close to the White House to run an independent, thorough inquiry. “The public cannot have the necessary confidence that matters involving the president’s campaign or transition team can be objectively investigated or overseen by the chairman,” Mr. Schiff said on Monday night. Still, Mr. Schiff stopped short of pulling the panel’s Democrats out of the investigation. Doing so could jeopardize Democrats’ influence over the inquiry and, importantly, their access to intelligence on possible ties between Trump associates and Moscow. The House Intelligence Committee is running one of the three investigations into Russian interference in the election, and possible ties between Trump associates and Russia. The Senate Intelligence Committee is running its own inquiry, and the F. B. I. has carried out a broad counterintelligence investigation since July. By most accounts, the Senate and F. B. I. investigations remain on track, unlike the House inquiry, which appears to have increasingly descended into a sideshow since its first public hearing a week ago. That was when James B. Comey, the director of the F. B. I. publicly disclosed the bureau’s investigation for the first time. Days later, Mr. Nunes made his first disclosure about Mr. Trump or his associates being caught in American intelligence gathering, prompting critics to argue that he was trying to shift attention and provide an assist to the White House at a crucial moment. The revelation that Mr. Nunes had viewed intelligence materials on White House grounds the day before bolstering the administration’s case fueled damaging speculation that he was acting at the instruction of the president. That could prove fatal to the bipartisan investigation, which has hinged on the ability of Mr. Nunes to conduct a neutral inquiry while maintaining the trust and cooperation of Mr. Schiff. Ms. Pelosi echoed Mr. Schiff’s call for Mr. Nunes to recuse himself, saying his behavior had “tarnished” his post and urging Speaker Paul D. Ryan to speak out. “Speaker Ryan must insist that Chairman Nunes at least recuse himself from the   investigation immediately,” she said in a statement. “That leadership is long overdue. ” In an apparent attempt to change the subject, Mr. Trump on Monday night questioned why the House Intelligence Committee is not looking into connections between Hillary Clinton and Russian officials. A few minutes later, he posted a second message on Twitter, concluding, “Trump Russia story is a hoax. ” The spokesman for Mr. Nunes, Jack Langer, said the congressman met with his source at the White House because he needed access to a secure location where people with security clearances can legally view classified information. But such facilities can also be found in the Capitol building, and at other locations across Washington. Senator Mark R. Warner of Virginia, the Democratic vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called it “more than suspicious” that Mr. Nunes went to the White House complex, pointing out that he would “have to be escorted” while there. “Who is he meeting with?” Mr. Warner said in an interview with NBC. “Was it a source or somebody from the administration?” Mr. Langer did not address those concerns on Monday. In a brief statement, he said: “Chairman Nunes met with his source at the White House grounds in order to have proximity to a secure location where he could view the information provided by the source. ” He added, “The chairman is extremely concerned by the possible improper unmasking of names of U. S. citizens, and he began looking into this issue even before President Trump tweeted his assertion that the Trump Tower had been wiretapped. ” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said on Monday that White House officials had no previous knowledge of Mr. Nunes’s visit to the White House grounds, saying the only information he had came from “public reports. ” He also said officials were “not concerned” about the prospect that someone within the executive branch had leaked classified information to Mr. Nunes. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, accused Mr. Nunes of weakening not only the committee’s tradition of bipartisanship but also Congress itself. He asked Mr. Ryan to replace Mr. Nunes. “He has not been cooperating like someone who is interested in getting to the unvarnished truth,” Mr. Schumer said. Acknowledging that the incidental collection from surveillance appeared to be legal, Mr. Nunes last week said his concerns surrounded additional names that may have been improperly “unmasked. ” Normally, intelligence agencies mask the identities of American citizens who are incidentally present in intercepted communications. Mr. Schiff said that Mr. Nunes also worried that anyone viewing the distributed reports could decipher whom they were discussing even though the names were masked. Mr. Nunes repeatedly declined to offer any details about the source of what he characterized as “dozens” of classified intelligence reports, which Mr. Schiff accused him of viewing in a “   excursion. ” Mr. Nunes said only that the information had come to him after the committee’s public hearing on Monday. On Friday, Mr. Nunes declined to say whether that information had come from the White House. “You can ask me every single name that exists on the planet, and I’m still not going to tell you who our sources are,” he told reporters. Mr. Nunes then defended his decision to bypass Mr. Schiff and go to the White House, saying he felt a “duty” to tell Mr. Trump because of Democrats’ “relentless” political attacks. “If we would have crossed paths in the hall, maybe I would have said something to him,” Mr. Nunes said in an interview. “But what I was trying to do was get to the president as quick as possible. ” At that point, Mr. Trump seized on the information, saying he felt “somewhat” vindicated in his wiretapping claim against former President Barack Obama  —   debunked by the F. B. I. director and the director of the National Security Agency, as well as the heads of the Senate and House investigations, including Mr. Nunes."
Apple just put Amazon’s Jeff Bezos in a tricky position,"’  ’ ”   Amazon and Apple are feuding over online video: Amazon doesn’t   sell the Apple TV on its site, and owners of the Apple TV device   can’t get the Amazon Prime Video streaming app. ” ’   Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos  earlier this month: ’ ’   Well, Apple    so now it’’s up to Amazon to   decide if they’’re ”acceptable.” ’ ’   On Wednesday, Apple announced that it will take a smaller share   of money from app developers who sell subscriptions through Apple   apps. ’ ’’ ”   Previously, Apple took a 30% cut of any transaction initiated   through an Apple app, including monthly fees. That’s a big issue   for TV services like HBO Now, which would see a substantial   proportion of its revenue go to Apple while it provides an     often expensive   service. ” ”   That’s why if you sign up for Spotify from an iPhone, it will   charge you more than if you sign up from a browser. ” ”   Now, Apple is letting developers keep 85% of revenue if their   customers continue to subscribe to a service for longer than a   year. After 12 months, Apple’s cut is effectively halved. ” ’   This change has less to do with iPhone apps than it does with new     services on Apple TV. ’ ’   In fact, Apple has already quietly been offering TV partners a   deal with a 15% cut for most of the past year. : ’ ’   As of now, most of the apps on Apple TV stream video only to   people who have pay TV subscriptions, such as DirecTV or cable. ’ ”   But this tweak means that a channel that wants to provide a paid   experience that you can sign up for on Apple TV will be able to   keep more money from those subscriptions than they used to     possibly encouraging them to take a second look at signing up new   customers through Apple’s   box. ” ’   Whether Bezos finds these new terms to be more ”acceptable”   remains to be seen. Bezos may not want to send any revenue from   Amazon’’s Prime subscription to Apple, but the change might be   enough to bring him back to the table. ’ ’Amazon and Apple are feuding over online. ..’"
"Maoists for Trump? In China, Fans Admire His Nationalist Views - The New York Times","BEIJING  —   They protest, picket and sing to defend Mao’s memory, yearning for the East to be red again. But lately some of China’s Maoists are finding inspiration in an unlikely insurgent in the West: Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump “has torn up the old rules of the ruling elites, not just of the capitalist West,” said Zhang Hongliang, a polemicist who is the loudest proponent of what could be loosely called “Maoists for Trump. ” In a recent essay, Mr. Zhang lauded the American president as being alone among national leaders daring “to openly promote the political ideas of Chairman Mao. ” President Xi Jinping of China will be sizing up Mr. Trump during a visit to his    estate in Florida this week, in the leaders’ first summit meeting. Meanwhile, many ordinary Chinese people have also been taking the measure of the new American president and have been bewildered, incensed and yet, sometimes, inspired. The global wave of nationalist,   sentiment that Mr. Trump rode to power has washed ashore in China, encouraging a   fringe that is hostile to capitalism and Western influence, and that the Communist Party has long sought to cultivate  —   and contain. China’s Maoists are a small minority most Chinese have no desire to revive the ruthless, convulsive politics of the Mao era. But the Maoists’ growing assertiveness, echoed in their embrace of aspects of Mr. Trump’s agenda, could help push the country in a more authoritarian direction. They also complicate the efforts of  Mr. Xi to play both sides of an ideological divide: as a robust defender of Mao’s legacy, but also a proponent of market liberalization and even a champion of globalization in the Trump age. It is a paradox that these admirers of Mao Zedong, a Marxist revolutionary who railed against Western imperialism, have found things to like about this American president, a property tycoon with a cabinet crowded with millionaires. But they want Mr. Xi to take a page from Mr. Trump’s “America First” script and protect Chinese workers from layoffs, privatization and foreign competition. “Trump opposes globalization, and so should China,” said one article on Utopia, a popular Maoist website. “Trump’s ideology has oriented toward China, and he is learning from China,” said another   Chinese site. China’s   as they are sometimes called, are loosely united by demands for stringent economic equality, zealous nationalism and a loathing of the capitalist West and liberal democracy. “Many of the same ideas now animating the global populist movement have been the hallmarks of the   movement for over a decade,” said Jude Blanchette, a researcher in Beijing who is writing a book about the movement. “The   have also clearly benefited from the rise of Xi Jinping, as he has blasted a pretty large dog whistle in their direction,” Mr. Blanchette added. Many on China’s far left see Mr. Trump as a dangerous foe who has questioned established American policy on Taiwan, vowed to confront China’s hold on the disputed South China Sea and threatened to cut Chinese exports to America. But some Maoists say Mr. Trump also offers a model. They think he led a populist revolt that humbled a corrupt political establishment not unlike what they see in China. They cheer his incendiary tactics, sometimes likening them to Mao’s methods. And they hear in his remarks an echo of their own disgust with Western democracy, American interventionism and liberal political values. Maoist meetings and websites dwell on a clutch of enemies, including the C. I. A. and America in general, genetically modified crops and advocates of privatizing state companies. But they reserve a particular venom for liberal Chinese intellectuals and celebrities who have condemned Mao. In the West, Mr. Zhang argued, the nationalists are on the right while the left generally supports internationalism. “But China is the opposite,” he said. “Chinese rightists are the traitors, while Chinese leftists are the patriots. ” The Communist Party never repudiated Mao’s legacy after his death in 1976, but it condemned his excesses, including the violent Cultural Revolution, and for years he was ignored or discredited while Deng Xiaoping pursued economic liberalization. In the 1990s, though, the party refurbished Mao’s image and fostered a popular revival to bolster its authority and blunt calls for political liberalization. Officials started using Maoists to intimidate liberal academics, dissidents and other critics. Before Mr. Xi came to power in 2012, a political rival, Bo Xilai, openly encouraged “red” nostalgia for the Mao era as part of an effort to build a populist power base. Mr. Bo was purged in a scandal, but the Maoists regrouped as Mr. Xi associated himself more closely with Mao’s legacy than his predecessors and called for a return to Marxist purity. Under Mr. Xi, Maoists have become bolder in taking to the streets and organizing online campaigns. A court ruling last year and legislation adopted last month protecting Communist heroes buoyed them further. Nobody expects Maoists to seize power in Beijing. They are disdained by the middle class and kept on a tether by the party authorities. Across China, there are maybe a few thousand active supporters of Maoist groups and causes, and their petitions against liberal intellectuals have gathered tens of thousands of signatures online, according to Mr. Blanchette, the researcher. But the Chinese left’s broader message of muscular nationalism and its criticism of widening inequality have reverberated, especially among retirees,   workers and former party officials dismayed by extravagant wealth and corruption. Mr. Trump and the global surge of nationalism and populism have added to the political tinder. Dai Jianzhong, a sociologist in Beijing, said Maoists could gain a bigger following if an economic slowdown caused mass layoffs, or if tensions with the United States escalated into confrontation. “It was a big shock for China to see American   society overwhelmed by this tide of populism,” Mr. Dai said. “China is a different society, but if the economy stagnates and workers feel badly let down, populism will gain influence. The influence of Maoists and ultraleftists would spread. ” In January, about a hundred protesters gathered in Jinan, a provincial capital in eastern China, to condemn a professor of communications and advertising, Deng Xiangchao, who had dared criticize Mao online. They chanted and held banners near Mr. Deng’s home, reviling him as a “traitor” and “enemy of the people,” and roughed up a few people who came to show their support for him. “We love Chairman Mao because we’re poor, and the poor all love Chairman Mao,” Yang Jianguo, a retired worker who was among the protesters, said by telephone after the protest. The university swiftly dismissed Mr. Deng rather than engage in a prolonged battle with the Maoists. Later,   activists also successfully demanded the dismissal of a television station worker who had voiced support for Mr. Deng. It would be unthinkable for the party to be so obliging of protesters for free speech or other causes the party considers anathema. But while Mr. Xi has silenced the party’s liberal critics, the party has tolerated, even abetted, its   opponents, giving the Maoist populists room to grow stronger. “Their influence has clearly grown with the leftist turn in ideology, especially since 2015,” said Deng Yuwen, a current affairs writer in Beijing who has criticized the Maoists. “It’s not that the top level of the party directly controls them, but the Maoists are politically astute, and they have a good sense of what they can get away with,” he added. “They know the officials use them, but they also use the officials. ” While party leaders may find them useful for intimidating critics, the Maoists want to take China in a different direction and reverse market policies that have fueled decades of growth, by seizing the assets of the rich and strengthening state ownership of industry, for example. Most phrase their criticism of the party carefully, but some openly accuse it of betraying Mao. “China is a capitalist state under socialist guise,” said Mr. Yang, the retired worker. “Capitalists dominate the country. ” Asked about the American president, Mr. Yang was more generous: “Trump has socialist tendencies, because the way he won power in a way reflected the workers’ demands. ” Many Maoists see Mr. Xi as a fellow traveler who is taking China in the right direction by restoring respect for Mao and Marx. But others say privately that even Mr. Xi may not be a dependable ally. They point out that he has promoted himself abroad as a proponent of expanding global trade and a friend of multinational corporations, drawing an implicit contrast with Mr. Trump. He Weifang, a law professor at Peking University who is often reviled by China’s far left, said Mr. Xi was playing a dangerous game by allowing Maoist populists to silence liberal voices and risked igniting political fires that he cannot easily control. “If political currents in China increasingly converge with populism,” Mr. He added, “that would have a powerful effect on China’s future. ”"

Doctor’s accuser: I trusted him but he abused me," (CNN) To    Rachael Denhollander, Dr. Larry Nassar was a household name, a man who famously treated members of a    Olympic team. For a   gymnast from Kalamazoo, Michigan, who had back and wrist injuries, it was a special opportunity for her to see someone who was held in high regard by athletes in the sport. That was in 2000. Nearly two decades later, Denhollander    now an attorney, wife, and mother of three children    was in court, telling a judge the doctor sexually abused her on five visits, right in front of her mother. Nassar, who is accused of almost two dozen counts of criminal sexual conduct and has pleaded not guilty, sat in a black and white jail uniform Friday. During the preliminary hearing, he listened to his accuser and two other women who alleged years of repeated abuse.  CNN does not typically name people who are allegedly the victims of abuse, but Denhollander has publicly identified herself.  Denhollander recalled her first visit with the doctor, who was then also a professor at Michigan State University in East Lansing. She said they agreed to do a massage technique called myofascial release therapy. She said she trusted him. ”He was the (1996) Olympic team physician. That’s why I was there, because he could do things other doctors couldn’t,” the     said during more than two hours on the stand. Nassar was ’revered,” accuser says, The alleged sexual abuse, she testified, began in the first visit. Nassar put two fingers in her vagina, though she said she thought during the visit that it was intervaginal muscular work, a treatment she heard about from a friend. Surely a national team doctor and an esteemed teacher couldn’t be doing anything wrong, she recalled thinking at the time. ”He couldn’t be a revered physician if he wasn’t doing legitimate medicine,” she said.  She left the appointment thinking that he had found things her previous doctors didn’t. Feeling hopeful for the first time in a while, she thought Nassar was ”very caring, very gregarious. He made you feel like he was going to take care of you.” She said she didn’t tell her mother, who couldn’t see the alleged abuse from where she was sitting, because ”the idea that someone would sexually assault a child while (her) mother was in the room wasn’t a classification that I had.” It was during her last   treatment that Denhollander said Nassar unhooked her bra and rolled her on her side on the massage table. His hand went to her left breast. ”I froze, because I knew that was sexual assault,” she said. Nassar didn’t speak in court Friday, the first day of the preliminary hearing. His lawyer, bound by a gag order, didn’t speak to reporters afterward. The hearing, which will continue May 26, will determine whether there is probable cause for a trial. No discussion of doctor’s techniques, Shannon Smith, Nassar’s attorney, in   Denhollander, asked the former gymnast whether she agreed that the doctor had techniques different from other doctors.  ”In terms of any question about the intervaginal procedures . .. even the massage to the breast area you described, you never asked Dr. Nassar, ’Can you explain to me why you did that? ’” Smith asked.  ”I did not. I didn’t want to draw any extra attention to it. I thought it was shameful enough,” Denhollander said.  Denhollander’s voice rose once during her interaction with Smith when she was being questioned about why she didn’t speak up during her treatment, rather than 17 years later.  The former gymnast said she trusted the doctor’s knowledge and experience. ”My presumption was he knew something I didn’t know,” Denhollander said.  The lawyer said: ”And it’s possible still that he knows something you didn’t know with his training and expertise.” ”No, ma’am,” Denhollander said sternly.  Two other witnesses    an adult woman and a girl    also testified Friday that Nassar put fingers in their vaginas, according to The Detroit News. When Denhollander found out the judge had ruled that a camera be allowed in the courtroom she asked the judge to turn one towards her as well. She said she did not want Nassar to walk in feeling like he won, and while being   she said, ”I want him and I want the public to know that I know where the shame and the guilt for this lies. It lies on him and not on me, and I am not afraid of the truth.” "
Kristol: At RNC Convention Trump Needs To Say He Regrets Some of the Things He Has Said - Breitbart,"Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” while discussing presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s upcoming Republican National Convention speech, Never Trump leader and Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol said Trump needs to admit regrets and that he made fun of people in “a nasty way. ”  Partial transcript as follows: STEPHANOPOULOS: Bill Kristol, you’re a Republican, who’s made no secret of his distaste for Donald Trump over the course of this campaign. What we’re seeing though, in our poll, is that he’s gone up from about support of about 77 percent of Republicans to up above 80 percent. How much room does he have to grow there? BILL KRISTOL, “THE WEEKLY STANDARD”: I mean, I think he has some room to grow because I do think he has  —   it’s a changed election. And the one thing I learned in 1992 in that first Bush White House is that if people want change, they’re willing to forgive some of the attributes of the candidate who’s for change or willing to rationalize some of the less likable attributes of that candidate, less admirable attributes, if the candidate helps them do that. Clinton crossed the bar at the Democratic Convention in 1992 with the Gore pick, his own acceptance speech and suddenly a guy who looked questionable before and was running second or third behind Bush and Perot takes the lead  —   (CROSSTALK) STEPHANOPOULOS: So what does Donald Trump  —   KRISTOL:  —   has to do. So I  —   I think it’s a big moment, that Thursday night speech. People, tens, how many millions of people are going to watch that speech? And if he has the ability  —   and I don’t think he does  —   to say, you know what, I’m running for President of the United States and I regret some of the things I’ve said during this campaign. I’m a colorful guy. I say what’s on my mind. How I made fun of some people in a nasty way I’ve said some things about women  —   STEPHANOPOULOS: Mea culpa in an acceptance speech. DOWD: That’s an R word he will never use: regret. KRISTOL: But I do think this is why  —   (CROSSTALK) CASTELLANOS: I don’t think you do that. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN"

Report: Islamic State Commander Omar Al-Shishani Clinically Dead,"Following an airstrike targeting him, reports indicate Islamic State commander and de facto “minister of war” Omar   sustained injuries that have left him “clinically dead. ”[“Shishani is not able to breathe on his own and is using machines. He has been clinically dead for several days,” stated Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.  Officials initially told Reuters the commander died in an airstrike on March 4 in  . Another official said the U. S. targeted him specifically with the airstrike in question. The following day, Rahman said Shishani did not die, but the terrorist group moved him to a hospital in Raqqa. The United States placed Shishani, also known as Omar the Chechen, on its   militants list and offered a $5 million reward. Shishani, born Tarkhan Batirashvili in Georgia, recruited others for jihad in his home country before he traveled to Syria and Iraq. Islamic State leader Abu Bakr   promoted the red haired,   Chechen to military chief. Unlike Baghdadi, Shishani never shied away from the cameras or videos. He appeared prominently in a propaganda video touring a children’s terrorist training camp. Outside of the Middle East, Russia is the largest contributor of people to ISIS. Last summer, Russian Foreign Minister Oleg Syromolotov announced that over 2, 200 Russians are currently fighting with the Islamic State (  ) terrorist group. “The figures start getting really alarming,” he stated, adding: At the time being, around 2, 200 people from Russia are engaged in the fighting in Syria and Iraq. Among them, about 500 came from Europe, where they had earlier obtained citizenship, residence permit or refugee status. We are thoroughly analyzing belligerent statements of IS leaders on transition of the “jihad” to Northern Caucasus and in Central Asia. Syromolotov also said the number is alarming because so many people could possibly come back radicalized. “It’s clear that they bring along not only their terrorist potential itself, but also radical ideas, a source for negative ideological impact on the society, especially on its most vulnerable members,” he said. In   the Interior Ministry reported over 400 Chechens have joined terrorist groups, mainly ISIS, since the Syrian Civil War broke out. “A total of 405 people, according to our data, have left Chechnya to join the fighting in Syria on the side of the Islamic State since the beginning of the war in that region,” said the spokesman. “Among those, 104 have been killed and 44 came back, while the fate of the rest is unknown. ” Chechens in Syria have threatened President Vladimir Putin for supporting Syrian President Bashar   and in a video released last September, vowed to liberate Chechnya and Russia’s North Caucasus. “We will, with the consent of Allah, free Chechnya and all of the Caucasus!” said the fighter. “The Islamic State is here and will stay here, and it will spread with the grace of Allah! Your throne has already been shaken. It is under threat and will fall with our arrival. We’re already on our way with the grace of Allah!”"
"Woman fakes pregnancy, kills woman, kidnaps baby, police say"," (CNN) A Texas woman faked a pregnancy then traveled to Kansas, killed an acquaintance and kidnapped her baby, Wichita police said Monday.  Yesenia Sesmas, 34 of Dallas, was arrested Saturday and charged with killing Laura   27, last week and kidnapping her newborn, Wichita Police Lt. Todd Ojile said. ”We believe they knew each other for a few years,” Ojile said.    Sophia Victoria Gonzalez Abarca was returned to her relatives in Wichita on Saturday. Sesmas faked a pregnancy for several months before the abduction, Ojile said. He didn’t disclose any other details regarding the motive, but he said Sesmas had spent time in Wichita before returning to Dallas several months ago. Jose Abarca, Sophia’s uncle, said getting his niece back gives him back at least part of the little sister he lost. ”Sophia is pretty much the last that we have from my sister,” he told   KWCH. ”I know her name is Sophia, but to me her name is going to be secretly, Laurita, like I call her. I think she’s the image of my sister. A little Laura.”  ’s boyfriend found her on Thursday in her apartment, shot to death, Ojile said.  Wichita police teamed up with a specialized FBI unit dedicated to recovering kidnapped children and tracked the baby to Dallas. Early Saturday morning, local police raided the home where Sesmas lived with her boyfriend, her son and her niece, Ojile said. ”We can’t forget that this is the best possible outcome to a very sad case,” Wichita Police Chief Gordon Ramsay told   KAKE on Saturday. ”The death of Laura Abarca will be on all of our hearts in the next coming days. . .. We want to do everything we can to bring this to justice.”"
This man made a new movie exposing Scientology’s inner workings and received physical threats,"’Since the release of Alex Gibney’’s   documentary ”Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief,” fascination over the Church of Scientology has been at an   high.’ ’Now the church is being examined through the unique style of BBC filmmaker . Known as the Michael Moore of Britain, Theroux often stars in his docuseries projects featuring  ”My Scientology Movie,” Theroux’’s first feature film (directed by ) is less of a broad historic look at Scientology, like Gibney’’s film, and more a spotlight on the alleged incidents church members have experienced under the thumb of current Scientology leader .’ ’”I had tried to do something on Scientology in 2002, but I reengaged with the subject after our producer Simon Chinn read the Lawrence Wright  piece [in 2011],” Theroux told Business Insider hours before the film’’s international premiere on Sunday at the Tribeca Film Festival.’ ’The film follows Theroux as he travels to Los Angeles to investigate what goes on at the church’’s headquarters. With the church unwilling to cooperate, Theroux enlists   executive Marty Rathbun (who also stars in ”Going Clear”) to give insight into what goes on there.’ ”This then leads to Theroux asking Rathburn to help him in casting reenactments of incidents that allegedly happened to church members, many of which involve the church’s leader, David Miscavige, bullying and physically abusing Scientologists.” ’As with ”Going Clear,” making ”My Scientology Movie” involved lawyers dissecting every piece of footage in the final cut to make sure BBC Films and others with stakes in the film weren’’t making themselves legally vulnerable.’ ’Due to differences in liable rules in the UK versus the States, Theroux believes ”My Scientology Movie” was scrutinized more by legal than ”Going Clear. ”’ ’”When you don’’t have access to a subject and all you have is   and critics, there is this gravitational pull toward telling a certain version of events,” Theroux said. ”Scientology would say this, and they have a point, that it’’s like doing a portrait of a marriage in which you’’re only hearing from the   and not the  . So as a journalist it’’s this nagging feeling that I’’m not getting the full picture. ”’ ”In the movie, many title cards giving information about alleged incidents also include   from the church. But Theroux believes Scientology’s side comes through in its actions during filming.” ”In a few instances, Theroux finds camera crews, allegedly Scientologists, filming him making the movie. (Scientology informed Theroux that it’s .) Rathburn also films alleged Scientology members harassing him.” ’”When they show up saying they are making their own film on me, or filming Marty, as a viewer you no longer have that thought, ’’I wonder how Scientology would characterize this? ’’ It strengthens the film,” Theroux said.’ ’But Theroux admits he may have gone too far in a key moment in the film. Following an encounter Rathburn has with alleged church members, Theroux and Rathburn discuss the incident, with Theroux reminding Rathburn that when he was in Scientology these were the kind of tactics he instructed people to use on  . This sets Rathburn off, and he curses out Theroux.’ ’”I think I was probably over the line,” Theroux said. ”Every screening I’’ve been in when that moment plays, it’’s tense and people think, ’’I don’’t know what I feel about this. ’’”’ ’But director John Dower believes it needed to be addressed.’ ’”Louis needs to ask that question because Marty had consistently batted it away so many times before,” he said. ”It so happens that’’s the only time he could get an answer out of him. ”’ ’”My Scientology Movie” offers the impression that even if you decide to leave the church, members will never leave you alone  —   especially if you go public with what goes on inside it.’ ’Since filming wrapped, those involved with the movie have thought the church was behind bizarre moments in their lives.’ ’Dower knows his Instagram account was hacked by the church because, according to Dower, Scientology officials admitted to doing it in one of their    letters to the BBC regarding the film.’ ’Then there are the threats toward Theroux.’ ’The morning of this interview, Theroux was locked out of his email account due to, as he called it, ”suspicious activity.” He believes it might be  . And a few months ago, the police came to his house telling him they’’d been tipped that someone wanted to do bodily harm to him due to his Scientology movie.’ ’”I asked the police where the threat came from and they said Scientology called them saying they had heard it,” Theroux said. ”I was like hold on, that doesn’’t sound right. They were the ones who made the call? Now I’’m on a special list where if I call the police they are on the fast track to where I am. But my take is it sounded like Scientologists were just trying to wind me up by getting the police to come to my house. ”’ ’Numerous attempts to contact Scientology to comment for this story were not successful.’ ”Here’s a clip from the movie:” ’’ ”Since the release of Alex Gibney’s  . ..”"
Jurors Refuse to Serve Under Stanford Rape Judge Aaron Persky,"At least 10 prospective jurors who were selected to serve on a case Stanford rape case Judge Aaron Persky is handling have refused to serve on the panel, citing their anger over his decision to give Brock Turner, 20, just six months in county prison as opposed to the six years that were originally recommended by prosecutors. [“I can’t be here, I’m so upset,” one prospective juror reportedly said, according to the San Jose Mercury News. “I can’t believe what you did,” another prospective juror reportedly said.  Although some of the complaints may have been genuine, the Mercury News notes that possibility that some of the jurors were using the Persky’s rape case ruling as an excuse to get out of jury duty. The Mercury News also noted that the more jurors ask to be excused, the longer the jury trial selection process will take, thus delaying any new cases. Persky, 54, a former sex crimes prosecutor, cited Turner’s lack of criminal history as the grounds for his more lenient sentencing, and noted that a longer prison sentence would have a “severe impact” on the former Stanford student’s future and life. Turner had been convicted on three felony counts, including intent to commit rape, sexual penetration with a foreign object of an intoxicated person, and sexually penetrating an unconscious person with a foreign object. In addition, Turner will be required to register as a convicted sex offender for the rest of his life. On Friday, the U. S. governing body for the sport of swimming banned Turner from the sport indefinitely. On Tuesday, Judge Persky  —   who is also a Stanford alumnis  —   entered another judicial term after his   race was canceled due to lack of challengers. Despite calls for his resignation, it is unlikely Persky will be removed from the bench. On Friday at noon, activists will deliver Stanford University law professor Michele Landis Dauber’s Change. org petition calling for Judge Persky’s removal to the California Commission on Judicial Performance, located at 455 Golden Gate Avenue in San Francisco. The petition has garnered over 1 million signatures so far. Activists from UltraViolet, a national women’s advocacy organization, will also present three bicycle billboards that read “Protect Survivors, Not Rapists. #PerskyMustGo. ” The billboards are a reference to the two Swedish PhD students who discovered the rape while riding on their bicycles. They were hailed as heroes by the unnamed female victim of the rape who had allegedly imbibed so much alcohol at a party that she became unconscious. She said she discovered what happened to her “sitting at my desk reading the news at work. I learned what happened to me the same time everyone else in the world learned. ” In her court statement, she explained that she now sleeps “with two bicycles that I drew taped above my bed to remind myself there are heroes in this story. That we are looking out for one another. To have known all of these people, to have felt their protection and love, is something I will never forget. ” Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter @AdelleNaz"
Free Speech Activist Mercedes Carrera Removed from SXSW Panel After Refusing to Censor Herself - Breitbart,"Politically active porn star, free speech activist, and GamerGate icon Mercedes Carrera dropped out of a panel appearance at SXSW this week after refusing to delete a list of tweets criticising notorious harasser and   activist Randi Lee Harper, who was also in attendance at the festival. [SXSW has been a festival of controversy among GamerGate after banning previous panels that were even mildly related to the   movement from taking place, partially due to pressure from   social justice warriors like Harper.  In an email to Carrera, SXSW Interactive Festival director Hugh Forrest listed a series of tweets along with the message, “Tweets that need to go away. Yes, all of these”. The tweets included a list of replies to other Twitter users, most of them talking about Harper’s attempts to censor and shut down the SXSW panel. “We are on gaming day, but Harper ensured @SXSW put us at an unpopular  we already got skewed media coverage,” and, “It just hurts too bad to be reminded of failure, eh Harper?” are just two of over a dozen examples sent to Carrera in request of deletion. Harper, who was dubbed an   activist by Fusion, has been caught harassing numerous people in the past whilst running her “ ” Online Abuse Prevention Initiative. She is know for her hateful and aggressive speech, and once told an opponent to set themselves on fire. “You’ve made your Gamergate bed, now get fucked in it,” and, “Fuck your feelings,” are also previous quotes of Harper’s. The   activist is also notable for doxing the head of a debt collection agency to which she owed money. Noticing the hypocrisy in the situation, Carrera responded to Forrest with the following email: Dear Hugh, It has come to my attention that you take issues with my personal opinions and commentary made on my personal Twitter account and my previously agreed upon appearance at the Savepoint panel hinges upon my willingness to self censor to your specifications. As my primary interest as an activist is in the realm of free speech, it goes without saying that I am tasked with upholding my convictions and morals. Therefore I must respectfully decline the request to abdicate my moral duty to those who might also find themselves in a situation where their speech may be censored. It is my hope that you understand that free speech is woven into the very fabric of Liberty that has made this country great, and as a female person of colour and sex worker I am well aware that my right for such always hangs precariously in the balance unless I stand up for it on a daily basis. I therefore leave you with the following legal maxim: he who fails to assert his rights has none. Best Regards, Mercedes, Carrera also addressed the situation on Twitter, writing, “It’s within in their right to attempt to impose censorship on me, and it is within my rights to decline to adhere to such. ” “The SXSW director refused to speak with me even though I requested to numerous times. He insisted upon forcing the organizer of the panel to do his bidding,” Carrera told Breitbart Tech. “Randi Harper has from the onset been the catalyst of the censorship. She censored us from the onset of the panel, attempted to have us shut down 5 months ago, and started complaining to Hugh when I discussed the failure of her all day summit after it had passed. Her tweets and the communication I received by proxy from SXSW indicate that Harper complaining about my critique of her was indeed the reason Hugh insisted I be censored should I want to speak at the panel. ” It’s within their right to attempt to impose censorship on me, and it is within my rights to decline to adhere to such. That’s Liberty.  —   ▲ Mercedes Carrera ▲ (@TheMercedesXXX) March 15, 2016,  Charlie Nash is a frequent contributor to Breitbart Tech and former editor of the Squid Magazine.

10 Things Nehlen Will Do When Elected - Breitbart,"In the 1st 60 days, I will:[1. Introduce legislation to implement the scaled tariff, which will bring hundreds of billions of dollars into the U. S. Treasury from mercantilist countries in the 1st year, and cause the biggest spike in U. S. manufacturing we’ve seen in our lifetime.  2. Introduce legislation to abolish the Puerto Rico hedge fund investor bailout and explain to U. S. taxpayers how Congress and the POTUS just set the 5th Amendment tripwire using the U. S. Versus Winstar case law as the example. 3. Sign on to HR3892 Muslim Brotherhood Terrorist Designation Act and vociferously defend its merits. 4. Sign on to HR3314 Resettlement Accountability National Security Act and vociferously defend its merits. 5. Sign on to HR402 National    Reciprocity Act of 2015 and vociferously defend its merits. 6. Introduce legislation to treat remittances to Mexico same as Cuba for the last 50 years, tax them at 20% to fund border controls (i. e. wall, personnel, equipment, etc). 7. Introduce legislation to fix the VA and immediately put all members of Congress and their staffs, VA workers and their families, on VA benefits only and remove them all from Federal Employee Health Benefits Program. 8. Demand the new Speaker debate an AUMF on the House floor. Speaker Ryan has shirked his most important duties: challenging Obama on separation of powers and his blocking of legitimate debate on the issue. The Framer’s never intended a POTUS could wage war on his own, and yet, we’ve seen this time and again with Obama and Hillary as Secretary of State. 9. Introduce legislation to term limit Congress to 4 terms as a Congressman (8 yrs total) 2 terms as Senator (12 years total) SCOTUS to one term of 16 years. 10. Vow to   term limits on myself of 8 years as Wisconsin’s 1st district Congressman. Nehlen is running for Congress in Wisconsin’s first congressional district, challenging Rep. Paul Ryan  —   the sitting Speaker of the House  —   in the Republican primary."

And if it means we have to play in empty arenas, I’m down with that.  “Maybe I pick up some fans. Maybe I lose some fans. I don’t know. I’ve heard it from both. I’ve had people say, ‘There’s no way I can support you. I won’t go to another Mavs game.’ And I’ve had people say, ‘You know what? We’re buying Mavs tickets. ’” This represents quite the shift from what Cuban said about Trump in May, when he told NBC he would consider running on Trump’s ticket if the Republican nominee asked him to. Of course, in the same interview, he also said he would consider running on Hillary’s ticket. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn"
One Killed and at Least 2 Wounded in Shooting Near California Polling Places - The New York Times,"AZUSA, Calif.  —   A gunman with a   rifle was found dead inside a home in a suburb of Los Angeles on Tuesday after shooting at police officers who responded to a report of gunfire and found one person fatally shot and two others critically injured, the authorities said. It was not clear if the gunman  —   a man whose identity was not immediately known  —   died of a   gunshot wound or had been shot by the police, Lt. John Corina of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said at a news conference. “We’re in the process of trying to figure out why this happened and who this person is and what exactly made him snap,” he said. The victim who was fatally shot was a man, but no details were immediately available about him. The two other victims, women ages 65 and 59, were in “really critical” condition, Lieutenant Corina said. “We don’t know what’s going to happen to them,” he said. The episode, which unfolded around 2 p. m. in Azusa, a city about 25 miles east of Los Angeles, took several confusing and conflicting turns as the authorities tried to sort out what happened and to whom. The acting chief of the Azusa Police Department, Steve Hunt, had said at a news conference earlier on Tuesday that the person who did the shooting was a woman armed with a   rifle and that the dead victim was also a woman. Asked about the inconsistencies with earlier accounts, Lieutenant Corina said, “With something like this there are a lot of rumors flying around and a lot of misinformation going out. ” He added that “so far we have found no evidence” of an accomplice in the shooting but emphasized that the police were searching    for anyone else who might be injured, dead or hiding. The shooting unfolded as five Azusa police officers and one from nearby Irwindale responded to a report of gunfire on Fourth Street. Chief Hunt said that officers found “multiple victims” and that as they were tending to them, the officers came under fire. They had to be extracted by armored vehicles. All of the officers who were pinned down by gunfire were “accounted for, safe and rescued,” the department said on Twitter. The gunman went back into a home and was barricaded there until tactical units entered the house and found him dead. Lieutenant Corina said that the police were obtaining a search warrant to look through the house. The victim who was fatally shot was lying in a doorway outside the home. What set off the shooting remained a mystery. “We’re still trying to figure it out ourselves,” Lieutenant Corina said. After the shooting, two schools were locked down and two polling sites  —   at Memorial Park and Dalton Elementary  —   were closed, with Memorial Park shut for the rest of the day. “Voters should avoid the area and, if necessary, cast a ballot at an alternate polling location,” Dean Logan, the Los Angeles County   and county clerk, said on Twitter. The police said the shooting did not appear to have any connection to the polling sites or Election Day. Alfonso Mendez, 42, who lives in the neighborhood, said he saw two vehicles crash at the intersection of North Angeleno Avenue and Third Street. “A big van and a white car were in an accident,” Mr. Mendez said. He said an occupant “ran out of the car and started shooting at the cops. ” Chief Hunt said there was no pursuit by the police leading up to the shooting. The lieutenant said it was not clear how  —   or if the crash  —   was related to the shooting."
Official Remain Campaign Tells Supporters: Use Jo Cox Death to Attack Brexit,"The official remain campaign, Britain Stronger In Europe, has seized upon the death of MP Jo Cox to promote its cause just days before the British electorate head to the ballot box to decide on Britain’s membership of the European Union (EU). [The campaign’s director Will Straw, son of the prominent Labour MP Jack Straw, has sent Remain supporters an email exhorting them to use Mrs. Cox’s death to attack the opposing Leave campaign by equating them with the politics of hate.  “Jo Cox was a friend of mine  —   and a passionate voice in our campaign to remain in Europe,” the email reads. “Her death was an unimaginable tragedy  —   but we won’t let her voice be silenced. ” He includes the text of the last article Cox wrote before her death which argued that leaving the EU would not help to control immigration levels, while remaining in would allow the UK to use EU funding to mitigate the pressures of high migration on social services. Written for PoliticsHome, it has since been republished in a number of papers and on the Britain Stronger In website. Straw encourages Remain supporters to share the article with their undecided friends, providing a link to post it on Facebook. Blogger Guido Fawkes has obtained a recording of a conference call between Mr. Straw and campaigners in which he laid out his strategy to deploy her untimely death in their campaign to keep Britain in the EU. “We need to recognise that people have been pulled up short by Jo Cox’s death and it is now time to make a very positive case for why we want to be in the European Union  …     to call out the other side for what they have done to stir division and resentment in the UK. That is something we must all do,” he said. In the last few days Remain supporters have promoted a narrative blaming Mrs. Cox’s death on an apparent climate of hate which they accuse the Leave campaign of whipping up in the run up to the referendum. Reflecting that narrative in his strategy, Mr. Straw called for Remain campaigners to explicitly link the values of tolerance and decency to their agenda. “Over the next few days, in all the conversations you have with people, in all the campaigning that you do, just think about this,” he said. “This is what we think is the closing argument of the campaign, reflecting all the arguments that we have been setting out for many months but also the new context that we’re in. What we want to say is people should vote Remain on Thursday for more jobs, lower prices, workers’ rights, stronger public services and a decent, tolerant United Kingdom. ” His strategy is likely to find a warm reception among Remain campaigners, some of whom had already deployed his tactics preemptively. On Saturday, despite the official campaign groups calling a halt to campaigning in respect for Mrs. Cox and her family, a Labour councillor on Kettering District Council took to Facebook to call on people to “do all we can” to “avert the Brexit disaster,” which she said stood for “fear and hate”. Shocking post from a Kettering Labour Councillor that should know better. Using a horrific event as a political tool pic. twitter.   —   Sam Watts UKIP (@swattsnhants) June 19, 2016, Locals reacted angrily, setting up a petition calling for her to stand down as a councillor. “It is not right for anyone to use the horrific murder of Jo Cox MP as a political tool nor is it right to alienate around half of those you serve by saying they stand for hate and fear, or that they are on par with a mentally disturbed murderer,” the petition reads."
"Phil Robertson Champions Marriage, Left Has Another Meltdown - Breitbart","The left is melting down about Phil Robertson’s speech to the Western Conservative Summit over the weekend in Colorado. [Robertson spoke up for complementary    marriage and so a writer at Mediaite called it “  hatred. ” A writer at Salon called it “hate speech. ” The Huffington Post called it a “public   session. ”  The left is especially incensed that Robertson believes that marriage is based on men and women rather than whatever is preferred by five judges on the Supreme Court. He cited “7, 000 years” of marital history as proof and also cited Scripture. This is a belief held by at least half of the adults in the United States and an overwhelming number of countries around the world. Robertson linked the 160, 000 murders in America over the last 13 years to the Supreme Court’s decisions  —   and the left assumed he is blaming those murders on gays. Here is how a writer at Salon put it: “Robertson claimed that high death rate, which has actually decreased in recent years, is the fault of LGBT people. ‘When you allow men to determine what’s right and what’s wrong, you get decisions like the five judges who said, ‘I may not know we have 7, 000 years of history of men marrying women, Robertson continued. ‘A male and a female. For that reason, they’ll leave their father and mother and cleave to one another and become one flesh. I know it’s been that way for 7, 000 years, but we know best for what’s everybody. ’” In fact, Robertson did not blame homosexuals for 160, 000 murders in the U. S. Robertson was making the rather unremarkable point that chaos follows when the elite embraces the cultural and moral relativism that also justifies changing marriage rules to allow   marriage. Rather than blaming gays, he is blaming a corrupt and unrooted legal and political culture. The left seems to delight in misunderstanding Robertson. None more so than when Robertson supposedly used the calendar to show that Jesus was God. Robertson used the calendar to explain that something remarkable happened in the man Jesus, after all, our calendar is dated beginning with his life. He said, “If your calendar is dated on of (sic) all the human beings who have ever walked on the earth, and your calendar is dedicated and predicated to just one of them, evidently something rather large went down back then. ” The left has tried for years to silence Robertson. They hate the idea that one of their own network  —   AE  —   has given him a platform. They were able to silence the Benham Brothers, who to this day refuse to back down on their beliefs about homosexuality and marriage. But the left has not been able to silence Robertson and his popular show Duck Dynasty. Even though Duck Dynasty is down in viewers, from a high of more than 11 million a few years ago to roughly 3 million now, the show is still the tenth highest rated on cable. Robertson still delights his audiences in his fearless defense of traditional beliefs, no matter how unpopular with the   media. At the Western Conservative Summit, he pulled his beard and explained it is the stuff of manhood and that the ladies present would never see him come in while they were putting on their makeup in the lady’s room, a reference to the current battles over men in dresses using women’s showers and locker rooms.

JAMIE DIMON: There is a ’national catastrophe’ and ’we should be ringing the alarm bells’,"’  ’ ’ Jamie Dimon is sounding the alarm. ’ ’ The chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase has taken the   opportunity on a number of occasions in recent weeks to highlight   problems in America, including its  and . He has set   out some . ’ ” Dimon’s influence beyond Wall Street seems to be at a   peak. He’s the chairman of the  at a critical time, with a   White   House opening its doors to business CEOs. He crosses the   political divide: a registered Democrat, he said recently   . The bank he heads last   month reported a strong set of   profits, with   . ” ’ Business Insider travelled on May 5 to speak with Dimon at   the Alfred E. Smith Career and Technical Education High School in   the South Bronx, New York. We talked about education, the   economy, and the Trump administration. JPMorgan Chase   had just announced a . ’ ’ This interview has been edited for clarity and length. ’ ’Matt Turner: Why are initiatives like this one   in the South Bronx so necessary right now? ’ ’Jamie Dimon: We’’ve made a huge effort globally   and in the US, in getting kids jobs. This is one piece. The South   Bronx and   schools need it more than most. It’’s our   hometown; JPMorgan Chase banks a lot of people here. My wife   [Judy Dimon] does a lot here, and so they’’ve been pounding it:   ”We need to do more in the South Bronx.” We need to get kids   getting out of high school, who go on with a job, or go on to   college and that leads to a job. ’ ’  ’ ”   We’re making an effort. We have some great partners here. If you   see the school, it works. You saw the kids today. They’re all   getting jobs, they’re smiling, they’re proud of themselves.   That’s what we need to do in   schools. ” ’Turner: You’’ve said that ”the lack of economic   opportunity for young people in the South Bronx is a moral and   economic crisis.” How did this happen? ’ ”Dimon: It’s not just this area. You have   unemployment now going  but if you go to a lot of inner cities,   unemployment among youth  —   think ages 17 to 25  —   is 20% or 25%.   The fact that parts of the country are doing well doesn’t mean we   shouldn’t focus on the part that isn’t. ” ”   Part of the problem is that jobs haven’t been done locally. These   kids can get jobs with the MTA. There’s a distribution company   down here, they know what these kids have been trained in, they   were part of the training effort. Locally, if you go to Texas,   they need welders. If you go to other areas, they need people who   can do construction, plumbing, electrical work. Business has to   be involved locally with civic society, in this case schools, to   get the kids trained to have a job. ” ’   There are plenty of jobs out there. When people talk about the   problems, I would say, ”What’’s the solution? What’’s the outcome   you want? How are you going to get there?” Civic society has to   do it together with business. It’’s not going to work with one   without the other. ’ ’Turner: You talked recently about a lost   generation, of people being left behind. What has the effect of   that been? ’ ’Dimon: When people talk about people being left   behind  —   middle wages have not gone up for years, and we should   recognize that, and there I think we need growth and skills  —   but   there are these other people who have been left behind. When I   say out loud, ”Fifty percent of   schoolkids do not   graduate from high school,” that is a national catastrophe. We   should be ringing the alarm bells. It’’s not fair. ’ ’  ’ ”   We were a land of opportunity. You can never have equal outcomes,   but you can have equal opportunity. Among those kids, we might   have had a Colin Powell, an Albert Einstein, we’ll never know. I   just think it is part of running a good society. People should   get involved in fixing that particular problem. ” ”Turner: The idea of going to school, getting a   job, working your way up, buying a house, that’s a part of the   American dream, and yet all those things seem harder to do. Is   the American dream still available to as many people now as it   used to be? ” ”Dimon: We have the best country on the planet.   We have schools, universities, food, water, energy, peaceful   neighbors, low corruption, you name it, deepest and widest   capital markets. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t identify   problems. We don’t have a divine right to success. If you look at   it, what are the problems? ” ”   One is,   wages haven’t gone up. One is,     wages haven’t gone up enough to create a living wage. One is,   people losing jobs, more to automation than anything else. The   solution? It’s retraining, relocation  —   it’s income assistance.   We’re just trying to recognize those things, that we’ve left some   people behind. And we haven’t done a particularly good job of   fixing it, Democrat or Republican. My own view, this is not a   political issue. It’s not a   reaction from either side.   It’s training, schools, getting growth going again. ” ”   Detroit would be a great example. If you look at Detroit, that   mayor, it’s been a train wreck for 40 years, the population has   gone from 2 million to 700, 000. This Mayor comes in, and he   talked about streetlights, sanitation, jobs, policing, schools,   affordable housing. He’s doing it all, and it’s growing for the   first time in 30 years. Literally, one man. But that one man   couldn’t do it without business. You’ve got wonderful people in   Detroit, like Dan Gilbert, JPMorgan Chase. And business couldn’t   have done it without a political environment where they wanted to   improve things. If you had an antibusiness environment there, it   would still be down there. ” ’    ’ ”Turner: For that lost generation, there’s some   anger at the global elite. ” ”Dimon: I kind of agree with it, when you leave   people behind, and those people who are left behind, it’s not   their fault, it’s the leaders of the institutions. There’s always   going to be an elite. You can have an elite in a communist   society. It is the leaders, something went wrong, and the leaders   collectively are responsible. ” ”   There’s some more terrible numbers  —   men, age 25 to 55, the     participation rate is down 10%. That’s unbelievable.   There are 35, 000 dying of opioids every year. Seventy percent of   kids age 17 to 24 can’t get into the US military because of   health or education. Obesity, diabetes, reading and writing. Is   that the society we wanted? No. We should be working on these   things, acknowledge the flaws we have, and come up with   solutions. Not Democrat. Not Republican. Not  . ” ”   Any good job is a good job. This whole concept of a   job?   It’s not true. I’ve heard it my whole life. Jobs lead to dignity.   If you’re good at the first, then you can get the second. Jobs   lead to household formation. Jobs are a better solution for   society. The other part, the  which can help the lower   paid have more a living wage, which will lead them to do more. It   will help small business. It won’t help big business. ” ”Turner: What impact has what you’re describing   had on the economy? Can the US get back to 3% or 4% growth? ” ’Dimon: I’’ve been clear. I think the reason we’’re   at 2% and not 3% is money spent on wars, the education system   leaving people behind, technology has left some people behind.   It’’s a lot of things we did. Government shutdowns. I don’’t think   it had to be that way. I don’’t think it was embedded in   something. It was the decisions we made. We should do something   about fixing it. I’’m comfortable we’’ll fix it. People always say   to me, ”What if it doesn’’t work?” If it doesn’’t work, we redouble   our effort. We’’re not going to cry like a bunch of babies. We’’re   going to redouble our effort. ’ ”   Detroit is a great example. It is working. The population is   going up, unemployment is going down, people are moving back in.   You can go to downtown Detroit today, an area I’m familiar with   because I’ve been going to Detroit for 30 years or so. You   wouldn’t have walked around downtown Detroit. Now, it is vibrant,   music, restaurants, it’s unbelievable. It actually works at the   local level if you do it right. ” ’    ’ ”Turner: Why isn’t that happening in more places? ” ”Dimon: I wouldn’t say it isn’t happening   elsewhere. Good reporters have written about little towns where   it is happening. And then there are towns where it’s not. ” ”Turner: JPMorgan Chase’s investment in the South   Bronx is from a $75 million fund, and the bank has a $250   million fund focused on similar issues. Does corporate America   need to do more? ” ”Dimon: I’m the chairman of the Business   Roundtable, which is 200 of the largest companies in America, and   one of our initiatives is around work skills, things exactly like   this. Think of disseminating best practices among government,   among business. A lot of businesses do it. If you went to any   major company, they’ll give you a good list of the stuff they’re   doing. We just need to do more. ” ”Turner: And when you talk to those CEOs about   the need for that kind of an effort, what’s their response? ” ”Dimon: They’re totally on board. Most CEOs are   patriotic and most CEOs can see the problems in front of them,   and they want to do something about it. We don’t always agree   about the ways and means, but the objective? We’re totally   together. ” ”Turner: You’ve talked about the     approach this administration is taking, and that being a welcome   change. How does that fit in to what we’re discussing? ” ”Dimon: People get boxed up in personalities and   stuff like that. The Trump administration’s [economic] agenda is   the right agenda. Corporate taxes have been driving capital and   brains and companies overseas for a decade. It has caused huge   damage in investment and jobs and productivity. It was a mistake.   We have to fix it. Counterintuitively, that usually helps     wages, and   wages, and job formation. ” ”   The second issue is regulation. If you talk to anyone involved in   business  —   forget banks and big business  —   talk to small   businesses  —   do it yourself, don’t ask me  —   they’ll tell you it’s   crippling.   formation is the lowest it has ever   been in a recovery, and it’s really for two reasons. One is   regulations and the second is access to capital for people   starting new businesses. ” ’   Then there is infrastructure. You might be shocked to find out,   we haven’’t built a major airport for 20 years. China built 75 in   the past 10 years. It takes 10 years to get all the permits to   build a bridge today. Ten years? What happened to the good old     America? Where is ”We get it done, we work together”?   We’’ve become this bureaucratic, stifling environment. I’’m not   talking about violating environmental things  —   I’’m talking about   building a bridge, getting things going, getting people to work   together. Even some of my friends noticed there was a bridge in   Cambridge being built across the Charles River. It was a teeny   little bridge. It took six years. Don’’t tell me that’’s not   corruption. I don’’t care what you say  —   that’’s corruption. ’ ’    ’ ’Turner: How confident are you that with the   current administration there will be change? ’ ”Dimon: The first thing you do is acknowledge   where some of the problems are. They’ve got real professionals on   the ground, deeply respected, both on the   and   state side, and the economic side, and they’re just staffing up.   Let them go at it. ” ’   Remember, it won’’t be up to them. They’’ve got to work with   Congress, with Democrats and Republicans. I think a lot of these   things that are good for all of America, we should get the   Congress, whether it’’s Democrat or Republican, to say, ”Let’’s get   those things done.” Those things are good for all Americans. A   lot of these things have hurt the average American. When they   look at the banks and they say, ”Well, the bank’’s talking its own   game,” I am telling you, what we’’ve done in mortgage lending, our   inability to have proper regulations around mortgages, has hurt   average Americans.   buyers, immigrant buyers, prior   defaults,   because they can’’t get a mortgage. Will   it make a big difference to JPMorgan Chase? No, but you’’re   hurting my fellow citizens. Let’’s go at it, and let’’s fix it. ’ ”   That mortgage example  —   our economists think that one example   would have improved GDP growth by 0. 3% a year. Over five years,   that’s 1. 5%  —   1. 5% would be 2 million jobs. If that’s true, let’s   do something about it. Let’s not sit here and twiddle our thumbs   and have Democrats and Republicans yelling and screaming at each   other. We’re hurting average Americans. ” ’    ’ ’   Turner: Do you think your voice and the voices of other CEOs   carry more weight now with the present administration? ’ ”Dimon: I think the administration is talking to   everybody. They are talking to CEOs, they’re talking to unions,   I’m told the president has Democrats and Republicans over for   lunch and dinner and on Air Force One. As the head of the BRT,   the CEO,  and I recently met   with a whole bunch of unions about what we could do that would be   better for everybody. It was a great meeting. We’re going to try   to get people to work together to fix these problems. It takes   collaboration. It’s not going to work if we all hate each other. ” ”Turner: You say the Trump administration’s   economic agenda is the right one. Is there a risk that some of   the benefits from that economic agenda could be undone by other   policies like trade and immigration? ” ”Dimon: It is possible. If you’re talking about   immigration and trade, people have made some pretty strong   statements on that, but my own view is that they have laid out   some real trade issues that are accurate for both China and   Mexico, where we can improve upon the trade agreements, and I   think we’ll improve on the trade agreements. I may be wrong, but   I think that is their objective, and they’re using tough words. ” ”   I think immigration has been one of the vital things about the   growth of America. I’m the product of grandparents who all   immigrated from Greece. I hope eventually we have proper   immigration. Good people who have paid their taxes and haven’t   broken the law, get them into citizenship at the back of the   line. I think that can be worked out. If people get educated   here, and they’re foreign nationals, get them a green card. I’ve   even heard the president speak about that. There are things to do   to make immigration work for all of America. ” ’Jamie Dimon is sounding the alarm. The chairman. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’"
It’s Time to Think About Refinancing Your Mortgage (Again) - The New York Times,"It’s a good time to check the rate on your home mortgage, because you might save money by refinancing. For that, American homeowners can thank British voters, central banks in Europe and Japan, and a global economy that just can’t get out of first gear. The average interest rate on a     mortgage was 3. 49 percent Monday, which is down from 4. 2 percent a year ago and 3. 9 percent at the start of 2016 (the rates on     mortgages and various forms of   loans are also down). This movement is being driven by shifts in the global bond markets. There is even reason to think mortgage rates could fall further in the weeks ahead as banks start to pass more of the savings from low rates in the bond market through to customers  —   though   refinancers would have to be willing to bet that global markets won’t reverse themselves in the interim. Bond yields rose Tuesday, which suggests that some reversal may have already begun. Using the rule of thumb that refinancing frequently makes sense when rates have fallen by a full percentage point, people who took out loans at the prevailing rate at various points in late 2013 and the first part of 2014 might see favorable economics for refinancing, as will those whose loan was first made anytime before  . People with narrower gaps between their interest rate and those that prevail now might also consider refinancing. That makes sense particularly if they expect to remain in their current home for many years, thus allowing time for even modest monthly savings to accumulate enough to justify the   expenses tied to refinancing a loan. Lower rates can make this a good time to refinance for people who want a different type of mortgage, like moving from a   loan to a   one to pay off the home faster. For a first cut at exploring whether refinancing might make sense in your situation, use any of several online calculators, such as this one created by the housing site Zillow. A mortgage broker or banker can help determine the exact rate, eligibility and fees that would apply. What no one can know is whether rates will pop back up or continue to drop. As much as mortgage rates have declined in 2016, and especially since Britain voted to leave the European Union on June 23, they actually haven’t declined as much as the   interest rates that prevail on the global bond market. From the end of last year until Monday’s close, the interest rate on   Treasury bonds had fallen 0. 84 percentage points, while the average rate on     mortgages was down only 0. 41. Essentially, banks have been able to keep much of the savings of falling global rates for themselves  —   the gap between those numbers, reflecting strong demand for loans and limited competition. That gap between   rates on global markets and what banks charge their customers for a mortgage has spiked repeatedly in the last few years, as it has in the last month, but those spikes have inevitably been  . Assuming the pattern holds, it would mean that mortgage rates will fall further in coming weeks, as competitive pressure takes hold and more banks pass along the low interest rates prevailing on the bond market to their customers. That said, there’s no guarantee that will happen. Yes, there’s reason to think that banks will lower the premium they are charging for mortgages. But with Treasury yields at   levels, the same technical forces that have driven rates downward in the last few months could reverse. That means that even small improvements in the global economic outlook could cause a rapid rise in rates. So if refinancing looks desirable now, you might save a little more on mortgage interest if you wait. But if you wait, your lucrative refinancing opportunity could evaporate. And if you have special powers to divine which direction rates are going next in this volatile year, every hedge fund manager on earth would pay handsomely if you would tell them."
"In a Walt Whitman Novel, Lost for 165 Years, Clues to ‘Leaves of Grass’ - The New York Times","Readers who picked up The New York Times on March 13, 1852, might have seen a small advertisement on Page 3 for a serial tale set to begin the next day in a rival newspaper. “A RICH REVELATION,” the ad began, teasing a rollicking story touching on “the Manners and Morals of Boarding Houses, some Scenes from Church History, Operations in  . ,” and “graphic Sketches of Men and Women” (presented, fear not, with “explanations necessary to properly understand what it is all about”). It was a less than tantalizing brew, perhaps. The story, which was never reviewed or reprinted, appears to have sunk like a stone. But now comes another rich revelation: The anonymously published tale was nothing less than a complete novel by Walt Whitman. The   “Life and Adventures of Jack Engle,” which was discovered last summer by a graduate student, is being republished online on Monday by The Walt Whitman Quarterly Review and in book form by the University of Iowa Press. A   tale of an orphan’s adventures, it features a villainous lawyer, virtuous Quakers,   politicians, a sultry Spanish dancer and more than a few unlikely plot twists and jarring narrative shifts. “This is Whitman’s take on the city mystery novel, a popular genre of the day that pitted the ‘upper 10 thousand’  —   what we would call the 1 percent  —   against the lower million,” said David S. Reynolds, a Whitman expert at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. But it also, Mr. Reynolds and other scholars who have seen it say, offers clues to another mystery: how a workaday journalist and mostly conventional poet transformed himself into the author of the sensuous, philosophical, wildly experimental and altogether unclassifiable free verse of “Leaves of Grass. ” “It’s like seeing the workshop of a great writer,” said Ed Folsom, the editor of The Walt Whitman Quarterly Review. “We’re discovering the process of Whitman’s own discovery. ” That transformation was one that Whitman himself wished to obscure. He said little about the early 1850s, when he hung a shingle as a carpenter in Brooklyn and published almost nothing, working instead on what became the 1855 first edition of “Leaves of Grass. ” Later, he all but disowned his successful 1842 temperance novel “Franklin Evans or The Inebriate,” and had little interest in seeing his short fiction revived. “My serious wish,” he wrote in 1882, “were to have all those crude and boyish pieces quietly dropp’d in oblivion. ” In 1891, when a critic was planning on republishing some of his early tales, he was blunt: “I should almost be tempted to shoot him if I had an opportunity. ” That doesn’t faze Zachary Turpin, the graduate student at the University of Houston who found the “Jack Engle. ” In fact, this is the second time archival lightning has struck Mr. Turpin. Last year, he announced the discovery of “Manly Health and Training,” a previously unknown     treatise that Whitman published in The New York Atlas in 1858. “A friend joked that that’s what would be on my gravestone,” Mr. Turpin said. The library of lost American literature includes many “known unknowns,” as Mr. Turpin put it (channeling Donald H. Rumsfeld) like Herman Melville’s “The Isle of the Cross” (the eighth and final novel he may, or may not, have finished) and Whitman’s “The Sleeptalker,” a seemingly completed 1850 novel he discusses in his letters, but which does not survive. Mr. Turpin has made a specialty of looking for the “unknown unknowns,” using vast online databases that compile millions of pages of   newspapers. One day last May, he entered some names and phrases from fragmentary notes for a possible story concerning an embezzling lawyer named Covert and an orphan named Jack Engle  —   one of many entries in Whitman’s voluminous notebooks that the online Walt Whitman Archive had deemed to have no clear connection to any known published material. Up popped the advertisement that included the name Jack Engle. The serial was to run in The Sunday Dispatch, a New York paper Whitman was known to have contributed to. “My   was really tingling,” Mr. Turpin said. Mr. Turpin ordered a scan of the first page from the Library of Congress, which held the only known (and as yet undigitized or microfilmed) copy of that day’s Dispatch. A month later, he was stunned to open a file showing a yellowing page containing “Jack Engle” and other names from Whitman’s notes. “I was at my  ’ setting up a Pack ’n Play, when the email arrived,” he recalled. “From that day until now, I’ve had this simmering inside me. ” The   tale, published in six   installments, may not belong in the American literary canon. “It’s not a great novel, though it’s not a bad read either,” said Mr. Reynolds, the author of “Walt Whitman’s America. ” Mr. Turpin called it “rollicking, interesting, beautiful, beautiful and bizarre,” with antic twists, goofy names and suddenly revealed conspiracies that recall “a   Thomas Pynchon” or even, he ventured, “It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. ” This may sound a long way from “Leaves of Grass. ” But Jack Engle and the other raffish young male characters, Mr. Reynolds said, are reminiscent of the     persona  —   “Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs”  —   he created with “Leaves of Grass. ” And then there’s Chapter 19, which Mr. Folsom called “a magical moment. ” Here, Jack enters the cemetery at Trinity Church in Lower Manhattan, and the madcap plot grinds to a halt in favor of reveries about nature, immortality and the oneness of being that strikingly echo the imagery of Whitman’s great work. “Long, rank grass covered my face,” says Jack, the   narrator. “Over me was the verdure, touched with brown, of trees nourished from the decay of the bodies of men. ” Jack wanders among those bodies of men, copying out the inscriptions of the tombstones of Alexander Hamilton, the War of 1812 hero Capt. James Lawrence (of “Don’t give up the ship!” fame) and other lost lives. Then, he exits onto the streets, where “onward rolled the broad, bright current”  —   and quickly and rather indifferently wraps up his own story. “Throughout the novel, you constantly see Whitman wandering off the plot, looking for life in all the nooks and crannies of the city,” Mr. Folsom said. “With the visit to the cemetery, where all plots end, it’s as if he’s suddenly lost interest in all plots  —   or at least this plot. ” Today, we think of the radically expansive free verse of “Leaves of Grass,” with its wandering “I” who “contains multitudes,” as one of the fixed signposts in American literary history. But in his notebooks from the early 1850s, Mr. Turpin noted, Whitman was toying with other forms for his great work. “You see him asking, Should it be a novel? Or a play, with thousands of people onstage, chanting in unison?” he said. “It’s amazing to think that ‘Leaves of Grass’ could have taken a different form entirely. ” Mr. Turpin said the graveyard chapter put him in mind of “Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,” one of the most famous poems in “Leaves of Grass,” where Whitman declares, “I am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever so many generations hence. ” But when asked how it felt to be the first in many generations to read Whitman’s   novel, Mr. Turpin reached for another   line. “Whitman said something really great: ‘Nothing is ever really lost, or can be lost,’” he said. “You really do start to believe it after a while. ”"
Smithsonian Hears Call for Women’s Museum - The New York Times,"Leading women from politics, the arts and other fields urged   Donald Trump on Monday to support a new national women’s museum in Washington that would be affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution. At a meeting in New York to give momentum to the idea, the group cited the report of a bipartisan Congressional commission in November that urged construction of the museum. “It’s tremendously important,” said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, who first proposed the project in the late 1990s. “How can you empower women if they are not even recognized?” The commission recommended “a national museum dedicated to showcasing the historical experiences and impact of women in this country. ” The commission did not specify a site but said its preference was for the museum, to be called the American Museum of Women’s History, to be located prominently in the capital, on or close to the National Mall. The museum will require legislation to become a reality. Emily K. Rafferty, former president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and one of the commissioners who produced the congressional report, said, “The women’s tale has not been revealed, has not been properly identified or properly articulated. ” The commission proposed that the government provide the land or an existing building for the museum. Private   of about $150 million to $180 million would pay for construction costs, it said. A spokeswoman for the Smithsonian, Linda St. Thomas, said its secretary does not believe the institution is in a position to establish a new museum at this time, but was committed to representing the contributions of women in all the Smithsonian’s museums. Last year on the Mall, the Smithsonian opened the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the 19th museum or gallery in the Smithsonian portfolio."
Anti-Trump Saudi Prince Tied to Both Rupert Murdoch And Hillary Aide - Breitbart,"Fox mogul Rupert Murdoch is partnered in multiple media ventures with Saudi Arabian Prince Alwaweed Bin Talal, including an Arabic religious TV network with a direct tie to Hillary Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin. [Both Prince Alwaweed Bin Talal and Murdoch’s Fox News network have become vocal critics of GOP Presidential frontrunner Donald Trump. On December 11, 2015 Bin Tala took to Twitter to savage Trump:  . @realDonaldTrumpYou are a disgrace not only to the GOP but to all America. Withdraw from the U. S presidential race as you will never win.  —   الوليد بن طلال (@Alwaleed_Talal) December 11, 2015,  The   TV network is a venture created by Alwaleed in association with Rupert Murdoch. As The Guardian reported in 2010: A company headed by the Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal says it plans to launch a new Arabic television news channel in partnership with Rupert Murdoch’s Fox network. The prince said the Kingdom Holding company’s   channel “will be an addition and alternative” for Arab viewers. It will compete with   and  .   TV’s stated goal is to “present true Islam” but the network’s programming has been often been radical. As The Sun reported in 2006: [M]uch of the content on his TV channel is overtly  . On March 31, the   of   Sheik Tareq   gave a speech at Dialogue between Europe and Muslims, a convention in Copenhagen that the channel was covering. “The West have done strategic mistakes   …     they underestimate the power of Islam,” he said. Sheik Suweidan praised the election of Hamas and Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood, warning: “The West have no chance but to deal with Islam, and we are extending our hands in peace and dialogue  —   you have slapped it. We do not accept insults. ” According to the official website of Prince Alaweed, one of the members of the Supreme Advisory board for his   TV network is “Dr. Abdullah Naseef, President of World Muslim Congress and President of Forum For Social Studies (FFSS). ” As Breitbart News has extensively documented,   TV  board member Dr. Naseef is the longtime benefactor of top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin’s family business, the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs. As Vanity Fair reported: When (Huma) Abedin was two years old, the family moved to Jidda, Saudi Arabia, where, with the backing of Abdullah Omar Nasseef, then the president of King Abdulaziz University, her father founded the Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs, a think tank, and became the first editor of its Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs, which stated its mission as “shedding light” on minority Muslim communities around the world in the hope of “securing the legitimate rights of these communities. ”   …     It turns out the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs is an Abedin family business. Huma was an assistant editor there between 1996 and 2008. Her brother, Hassan, 45, is a   editor at the Journal and was a fellow at the Oxford Center for Islamic Studies, where Nasseef is chairman of the board of trustees. Huma’s sister, Heba, 26, is an assistant editor at the Journal.   …     In his early years as the patron of the Abedins’ journal, Nasseef was the   of the Muslim World League, which Andrew McCarthy () claims “has long been the Muslim Brotherhood’s principal vehicle for the international propagation of Islamic supremacist ideology. ” The Muslim World League was the mother organization of two groups the U. S. government thinks was involved in funneling money to terrorists —  the Rabita Trust and the International Islamic Relief Organization (IIRO). Both groups are listed on the Treasury department’s website of terrorist organizations. Naseef’s Rabita Trust   Wa’el Hamza Julaidan was one of the founders of Al Qaeda. These connections have been hidden by the mainstream media. Breitbart News demonstrated attempted to muddy the connection between Saudi Arabian raised Huma Abedin and Nassef when questions about Abedin were raised by a group of Congress members in 2012. It’s been widely reported that Bin Talal is a large investor in Murdoch’s Fox News, but much less attention has been paid to  . In early 2015, Bin Talal’s Kingdom Holding Company reduced his stake in Murdoch’s News Corp to 1 percent but maintains a 6. 6 percent interest in 21st Century Fox, which controls Fox News. As CNN Money reported: News Corp. is Murdoch’s publishing operation, made up of the New York Post and the Wall Street Journal as well as the book publisher HarperCollins. The more valuable 21st Century Fox is home to a host of television and film properties such as Fox Searchlight, the Fox broadcasting network and Fox News.   …     “We have a strategic alliance with Rupert Murdoch for sure and I have been with him for the last 15 or 20 years,” Alwaleed said. “My backing of Rupert Murdoch is definitely unwavering. ” The connection between Alwaleed, Murdoch, Abedin, Hillary Clinton and Saudi Arabia are troubling given a number of recent events. Prince Alwaleed is boasting about his role in impacting U. S. elections. As Breitbart News Network’s Aaron Klein reported, the Saudi Arabian news site Sabq claims that “Alwaweed Bin Talal caused a decline in Trump’s popularity. ”  CNN reported in 2008 that “donations to the William J. Clinton Foundation include amounts of $10 million to $25 million from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. ” Huma Abedin was hired as a consultant to the William J. Clinton Foundation after Clinton left her role as Secretary of State. Abedin is also at the center of Hillary Clinton’s private email server scandal. Huma Abedin’s mother currently lives in Saudi Arabia and runs the Journal for Muslim Minority Affairs and is also a dean at a woman’s college there."
What Is Lost by Burying the Trans-Pacific Partnership? - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Congressional leaders confirmed this week what seemed inevitable with the triumph of Donald J. Trump: The   trade agreement with 11 other Pacific Rim nations that President Obama hoped to leave as a major legacy, but which Mr. Trump called “a terrible deal,” is dead. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the incoming Democratic leader, told labor leaders on Thursday that the pending   Partnership, the largest regional trade agreement in history, would not be approved by Congress. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said   “no” when reporters on Wednesday asked whether the agreement would be considered in the   Congress that convenes next week  —   its last legislative chance, given the opposition from the  . Mr. Trump, whose invectives against trade agreements were central to his appeal to disaffected   voters, will have the authority as president “to negotiate better deals, as I think he would put it,” Mr. McConnell said. Yet there is little likelihood of Mr. Trump seeking a new agreement. That reflects not only his campaign statements, but also his yearslong hostility to past trade accords as well as the sheer difficulty of renegotiating a Pacific pact that was seven years in the making, entailing compromises among a dozen countries including Australia, Canada, Chile and Japan, but excluding China. Another broad trade deal still being negotiated, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between Europe and the United States, is a likely casualty of the Trump election and a global backlash against trade. The discussions “are dead, and I think everybody knows it,” Matthias Fekl, the French secretary of state for trade, said Friday as trade ministers met in Brussels. “Globalization has created lots of losers, lots of difficulties. ” Mr. Obama faces the prospect of many of his signature achievements dying or being pared back dramatically during the Trump administration. The   and congressional leaders have vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Trump has said he will pull the United States out of last year’s Paris climate agreement and kill off Mr. Obama’s global warming regulations. The   law regulating Wall Street could be carved up. But the   Partnership, painstakingly negotiated but little understood, will be buried with few in either party to mourn it. It was hailed by its negotiators as the most sophisticated such deal ever, establishing the rules of commerce that would rope both sides of the Pacific together into a   economy, while cementing the United States’ alliance with Asia. Which raises the question: What would be lost by abandoning it, for the nation and for specific industries from Hollywood to America’s ranches and farmlands? Its specifics were mostly ignored in the political attacks from both parties. Instead, for many voters the Pacific agreement was simply a lightning rod for their broader discontent with stagnant wages and job losses blamed on globalization and past trade agreements. The other parties to the agreement are Brunei, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. “Popular understanding of the T. P. P. is very low,” Kevin G. Nealer, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in a postelection analysis on Thursday. With its abandonment, he added, “The risk to America’s role as trade policy leader  —   and therefore to the global economy  —   is real and immediate. ” Mr. Obama and his team likewise emphasized the potential geopolitical blow, even as they promoted the economic benefits the trade agreement would offer American exporters by eliminating thousands of tariffs and other trade restrictions in the other countries. Forsaking the agreement, the president insisted, would undercut the United States’ standing in the     region as a reliable counterweight to an expansionary China, economically and militarily, for America’s allies there. The other countries have approved the pact or are in the process of doing so, but without the approval of the United States, it does not take effect. That tension could well be evident later this month, when Mr. Obama and his trade representative, Michael B. Froman, attend the annual   Economic Cooperation summit. The Americans will have to explain their failure on the trade agreement to foreign leaders gathered in Lima, Peru, while China’s leader, Xi Jinping, is there seeking progress toward an emerging alternative to the   Partnership  —   the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, known as R. C. E. P. which includes China, Japan and 14 other Asian countries but excludes the United States. “In the absence of T. P. P. countries have already made it clear that they will move forward in negotiating their own trade agreements that exclude the United States,” Mr. Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers wrote days before the election. “These agreements would improve market access and trading opportunities for member countries while U. S. businesses would continue to face existing trade barriers. ” One example is a bilateral agreement between Australia and Japan, which gives Australian beef exporters a price advantage over American producers whose exports are subject to higher Japanese tariffs those tariffs would ultimately have been removed under the Pacific agreement. “We are experiencing lost sales without T. P. P. ” of about $400, 000 a day as a result, said Kevin Kester, a California cattle rancher and vice president of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association. “Multiply that over several hundred more products and several dozen more   relationships,” Mr. Froman said in an interview. The T. P. P. would have phased out some 18, 000 tariffs that the other 11 countries have on imports from the United States, thus reducing their cost to foreign buyers. Beyond such typical trade actions, it also would have established a number of precedents for international trade rules dealing with digital commerce, intellectual property rights, human rights and environmental protection. A number of countries had agreed to copyright protections, benefiting sectors like the film industry. The agreement would have assured an open internet among the 12 nations, including in   Vietnam, encouraging digital trade and serving as a contrast to China’s walls to internet traffic. It included commitments against wildlife trafficking  —   Vietnam, for example, is a major market for rhino horns and ivory  —   and against subsidies in that country and others on both sides of the Pacific that encourage overfishing. For the first time in a trade agreement,   businesses like those in Vietnam and Malaysia would have had to comply with commercial trade rules and labor and environmental standards. The agreement would have committed all parties to the International Labor Organization’s principles prohibiting child labor, forced labor and excessive hours, and requiring collective bargaining, a minimum wage and safe workplaces. While unions and human rights groups remained skeptical about enforcement, the United States reached separate agreements with Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam in which the three countries committed to specific labor changes, under penalty of the United States’ restoring tariffs for noncompliance. Those side agreements will fall along with the overall trade pact.   antitrade politics aside, the biggest hurdle to Republicans’ consideration of the Pacific pact was objections from some  —   led by Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, chairman of the committee responsible for trade  —   to   provisions that would have limited monopoly protections for   pharmaceutical companies’   biologics. Those are advanced drugs used, for instance, in cancer treatments. The Obama administration  —   pressed by nearly every other nation, the generic drug industry and nonprofit health groups like Doctors Without Borders, all of which wanted quicker access to affordable lifesaving drugs  —   had agreed that drugmakers could keep production data secret for five to eight years, fewer than the 12 years in federal law. Mr. Hatch had demanded 12 years. But administration officials were hindered in how far they could go to appease Republicans given strong opposition in other countries to any change. Without the trade agreement, however, drug companies have no monopoly protections for biologics data in some countries. Democrats, organized labor and the Ford Motor Company were especially opposed to the trade agreement because it did not include what they considered enforceable protections against other countries’ manipulation of their currency’s value to gain price advantages for their products. The pact did have a side agreement that, in another first for trade accords, included the parties’ “joint declaration” against currency manipulation, required them to report interventions in exchange markets and set annual meetings to discuss any disputes. Another innovation in the T. P. P. was provisions to help small businesses, which lack the resources of big corporations, to navigate export rules, trade barriers and red tape. Opponents on the left were especially critical of the agreement for opening the door to more foreign subsidiaries being able to go to special trade tribunals to sue to block local, state or federal policies  —   environmental or consumer safety rules, say  —   on grounds that the rules conflict with corporations’ rights under the trade pact. The administration, however, countered that the trade agreement actually reformed the     Dispute Settlement tribunals, which are a longstanding feature of trade policy. It called for changes responding to criticisms that the tribunals favor corporations and interfere with nations’ efforts to protect public health and safety."
Bodies of missing Indiana girls found police say they were killed," (CNN) The bodies of two missing Indiana girls found in the woods near a creek have been identified, and their deaths are being investigated as a double homicide, authorities said Wednesday. Autopsy results confirmed the victims as Liberty ”Libby” German, 14, and Abigail ”Abby” Williams, 13.  The bodies were discovered by search volunteers Tuesday along a railroad bridge near Dear Creek in Delphi, about 70 miles northwest of Indianapolis, the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.  Missing since Monday, On Monday, the teens were dropped off to go hiking, but when they did not show up to be picked up by family members, police were notified. Soon after, a search party was formed of community volunteers and several law enforcement agencies, police said.  This is believed to be the first   investigation in Carroll County’s recent history, State Trooper Sgt. Kim Riley said at a news conference.  Police are not releasing the cause and manner of death of the teens at this time.  The investigation  Police provided a photograph of a man who was on the Delphi Historic Trails about the time Abigail and Liberty were walking. They are asking help from the public to identify him so he can be contacted regarding what he might have seen. Investigators are proceeding with caution and not calling the individual in the photograph a suspect. There is no suspect( s) in custody at this time, police said.  ”There is someone out there that did this crime and we’re going to track them down,” Sheriff Tobe Leazenby told CNN affiliate WXIN. ”Folks should continue with business as usual but be more mindful and watch your surroundings a little closer.” Police are asking anyone who has any information on the case to call the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office at    the Delphi Police Department at    or Indiana State Police at   .

Muted U.S. Response to China’s Seizure of Drone Worries Asian Allies - The New York Times,"BEIJING  —   Only a day before a small Chinese boat sidled up to a United States Navy research vessel in waters off the Philippines and audaciously seized an underwater drone from American sailors, the commander of United States military operations in the region told an audience in Australia that America had a winning military formula. “Capability times resolve times signaling equals deterrence,” Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr. told a   crowd of diplomats and analysts at the prestigious Lowy Institute in Sydney, the leading city in America’s closest ally in the region. In the eyes of America’s friends in Asia, the brazen maneuver to launch an operation against an American Navy vessel in international waters in the South China Sea about 50 miles from the Philippines, another close American ally, has raised questions about one of the admiral’s crucial words. It was also seen by some as a taunt to   Donald J. Trump, who has challenged the One China policy on Taiwan and has vowed to deal forcefully with Beijing in trade and other issues. “The weak link is the resolve, and the Chinese are testing that, as well as baiting Trump,” said Euan Graham, the director of international security at the Lowy Institute. “Capability, yes. Signaling, yes, with sending   fighter jets to Australia. But the very muted response means the equation falls down on resolve. ” Across Asia, diplomats and analysts said they were perplexed at the inability of the Obama administration to devise a strong response to China’s challenge. It did not even dispatch an American destroyer to the spot near Subic Bay, a former American Navy base that is still frequented by American ships, some noted. After discussions at the National Security Council on how to deal with the issue, the Obama administration demanded the return of the drone. On Saturday, China said it would comply with the request but did not indicate when or how the equipment would be sent back. The end result, analysts said, is that China will be emboldened by having carried out an act that amounted to hybrid warfare, falling just short of provoking conflict, and suffering few noticeable consequences. “Allies and observers will find it hard not to conclude this represents another diminishment of American authority in the region,” said Douglas H. Paal, the vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Significantly, the Chinese grabbed the drone not only in international waters but outside even the “  line” that China uses as a marker for its claims in the South China Sea. In so doing, analysts said, Beijing was making the point that the entire sea was its preserve, even though it is entirely legal for the United States to conduct military operations in waters within 200 miles of the Philippines, an area known as an exclusive economic zone. In the last dozen years, China has steadily showed off its growing military prowess to the countries around the South China Sea, which carries trillions of dollars of world trade and which China values for its strategic access to the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean. As China has built up its navy and its submarine fleet in the last decade, it has also emphasized what it calls its “inherent” right to dominate the regional seas, and to challenge the presence of the United States, its allies and partners in Asia. The drone episode, which occurred on Thursday and was first broadcast by CNN despite efforts by the Obama administration to settle it quietly, was of a different nature and just as disquieting as past confrontations with China that involved bigger ships and more dangerous maneuvers, analysts said. In 2001, soon after President George W. Bush came to office, an American spy aircraft, an   was forced to land on Hainan Island after colliding with a Chinese fighter jet. The Chinese stripped the plane of its assets and returned it broken down to its parts and packed in boxes. In 2009, two months after President Obama took office, Chinese vessels swarmed a United States Navy reconnaissance ship, the Impeccable, in what the Pentagon said were dangerous and unprofessional maneuvers. This time, China chose a more unconventional method to challenge the United States and hastened the timetable, challenging a   rather than a newly installed president as it has in the past. The drone itself, known as an unmanned underwater vehicle, was not a particularly important piece of equipment. Such drones are deployed to gather military oceanographic data and are available over the counter for about $150, 000, the Pentagon said. Data from the drone would no doubt be used to help track China’s growing submarine fleet, naval experts said. More important than the equipment was the principle of freedom of navigation in international waters, and whether China was in the process of imposing its own rules in the South China Sea  —   more than 800 miles away from its coastline, said Alexander Vuving, a specialist on Vietnam at the   Center for Security Studies in Hawaii. “This is China showing that it is in the process of setting the rules in the South China Sea, imposing its own view in the South China Sea and saying the South China Sea should be its own backyard,” Mr. Vuving said. “If China can get away with this incident with impunity,” he added, “this will send a chilling message to countries in the region. ” Some leaders, like President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, will feel validated in a pivot away from the United States toward China, Mr. Vuving said. “Others, like the Vietnamese, will have to seriously rethink their regional outlook. ” Vietnam  —   always fearful of China, its neighbor to the north, but also careful not to alienate Beijing  —   has tried in the last few years to draw closer to the United States, while still maintaining a careful distance. In 2011, as China became more assertive in the South China Sea, Vietnam accused China of instructing three   patrol boats to  cut the cables of a Vietnamese oil and gas survey ship. The authoritarian Vietnamese government was so furious that it allowed   demonstrations in Hanoi. In 2014, China moved a   oil rig to waters close to the Paracel Islands that both Vietnam and China claim, and then blasted a flotilla of Vietnamese ships with water cannon. Since then, China has hardened its position, sometimes referring to the South China Sea as a “core interest” in which there is no room for compromise, though others in the region call it bullying by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. Under that vision, China would be in control from the waters of Indonesia to Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and up to Japan. In the East China Sea, China and Japan are at odds over an uninhabited island chain, known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China. In June, China sent a warship for the first time into the waters around the islands, further escalating tensions. Japan has been more outspoken than other Asian countries in its support for the Obama administration’s objections to China’s construction of military facilities on seven artificial islands in the South China Sea. But in Tokyo, the government was watching the outcome of the drone episode with some anxiety. So far, Washington’s restrained response has not been reassuring."
Lionel Messi announces Argentina return," (CNN) Lionel Messi has announced that he will play for Argentina once again, having stated in June that he would retire from international football. The Barcelona star said Friday that although he was disappointed after losing the Copa America final to Chile on penalties, he was keen to help Argentinian football from the inside rather than criticize from outside. ”Many things went through my head on the day of the final and I thought seriously about leaving it but I love my country and this shirt too much,” he said in a statement released through his management company and tweeted by the Argentinian Football Association. ”I see that there are a lot of problems in Argentine football and I’m not trying to create another one. I don’t want to cause any harm. I have always tried to do the opposite, to help in any way that I can.” Messi was subsequently announced in Argentina’s squad for September’s World Cup 2018 qualifiers against Uruguay and Venezuela.

Why Akihito’s speech matters," (CNN) On Monday, Japanese Emperor Akihito delivered a rare televised address to the nation about his declining health and the burden of his duties. In doing so, he has launched a   discussion about the role of the country’s royal family    and perhaps about Japan’s future. According to Japanese law, Akihito, 82, must serve as emperor for life. Yet his speech has invited speculation that he might wish to abdicate the throne. And while Akihito did not state his intentions explicitly, meaning his words will remain open to interpretation, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other political leaders stressed the need to take the emperor’s address seriously.  Such statements suggest this could be the opening chapter of a debate about reforming Japan’s imperial traditions.  Japan’s postwar constitution stipulates the emperor is a symbol of the state and shall not have powers related to government the emperor cannot issue statements that might be considered political and Akihito therefore avoided any direct reference to abdication, which some might construe as a critique of the laws governing the imperial household.  However, Akihito did appear to address the issue indirectly, commenting on his poor health (he has had cancer and heart surgery in recent years) as a possible segue to a discussion of what might be possible if the emperor cannot perform his duties. He noted, for example, that a regent can be appointed if the emperor cannot fulfill his duties as a symbol of the state.  Akihito also expressed concern about the ceremonial burdens placed on Japanese society when the emperor passes away and wondered aloud whether such a situation could be avoided. This appears to suggest he favors abdication, and it is widely believed that Akihito might hope to appoint his son, Crown Prince Naruhito, who is 56. The problem with this idea, of course, is that there is no provision for abdication in imperial household law and the Diet (parliament) would have to pass legislation authorizing this change.     What has prompted Akihito to speak out now? His health could be the prime motivating factor behind the speech, although there is also some speculation that he is displeased with Abe’s efforts to increase Japan’s role in security affairs. Last year, the Abe government passed a package of legislation authorizing a range of defense policy reforms, such as exercising the right of collective   or coming to the defense of an ally under attack. But while coordinating more closely with the United States and other partners is a practical response to a rapidly changing security environment in East Asia, Abe’s detractors consider those reforms a departure from the pacifist principles in Japan’s constitution and some point to Akihito’s recent comments on Japan’s wartime past as potentially critical of Abe’s policy agenda (though those comments also were vague and open to interpretation).   Regardless of the emperor’s motivations, his decision to address the people directly carries significant weight.  (The only other time he has done so outside of ceremonial duties was in 2011, when he sought to console the nation in the aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake.)  Despite the ceremonial nature of his duties as a symbol of the state, the public respects the emperor’s role and recent opinion polls in Japan indicate support for revising the law to allow for abdication.  The government therefore has to find a way to be responsive.   Prime Minister Abe acknowledged the seriousness of the emperor’s comments about his age and the burden of his duties and stressed the need to think about what might be done, though without addressing abdication, specifically to avoid implying that the emperor spoke to a political issue.  Some media reports suggest Abe could form a committee of experts to examine the issue and legislators could do the same when the Diet reconvenes this fall. But adherents to tradition might balk at opening the door for reform, likely yielding an incremental approach to the issue.   Ultimately, whatever the timeline and whatever his motivation, Emperor Akihito has signaled it is time for a debate about imperial tradition in Japan. And that reality is sure to animate the country’s policy debate in the weeks and months ahead.  "
9/11 FDNY chief’s blood vial allows for burial,"St. James, New York (CNN) New York firefighter Michael Stack was angry for years after he lost his father on September 11, 2001. He was angry that his dad, an FDNY battalion chief whose remains were never found, had missed so much of his life.  He was angry every time one of his four children was christened and his father wasn’t there to witness it. And he remained angry when his brother Brian, also an FDNY firefighter, got married and had children of his own who would never meet their grandfather.   But on Friday    a beautiful late spring morning on Long Island    Stack announced to a crowd of family and colleagues: ”I’m not mad anymore.” Because 15 years after Battalion Chief Lawrence ”Larry” Stack died in the World Trade Center attacks, his family finally had recovered a part of him that once flowed through his heart, a part of Larry Stack that finally could be laid to rest:  a vial of blood.   Helping ’even the smallest’ Larry Stack was a man who, by all accounts, was kind, selfless, and brave. Prior to his 33 years of service with the FDNY, he served in the United States Navy for six years, including a tour of duty in Vietnam.   Among his efforts to help others, he donated blood, according to Father Thomas J. Haggerty, a pastor who presided over Stack’s funeral.   He was ”reaching out to even the smallest and least among us,” Haggerty said.  That was just one of many acts of kindness Larry Stack was known for.  So on that clear September morning when he witnessed a plane hit the South Tower of the World Trade Center from the rooftop of his ladder company in Brooklyn, it was no surprise to anyone when Larry Stack headed straight to the scene.   ’Holding out hope’ A few months after September 11, 2001, the loss of his father still fresh, Michael Stack remembers helping his   put together a computer desk.   ”When I was done, I saw an email that she printed in the garbage.  I guess she was testing her printer out.  Anyway, the email she sent to a friend read, ’I don’t think we’re going to get back my nephew Larry. ’” Michael Stack, then only 31 years old, was still holding out hope.  And then a few more months passed.  The months became years.  The years became a decade. And then after 15 years, perhaps in a   effort to find some part of their father that still remained, the family remembered the blood donations Larry Stack had given prior to September 11. They contacted the New York Blood Center  ”in hopes that blood the Chief had donated several years ago would still be saved in their bank,” according to a post on FDNY’s Facebook.   To the family’s elation, the New York Blood Center confirmed that some of his blood was still in their possession. Finally, Michael Stack and his family had found their father, a vital part of him that once flowed through his veins, that once supplied oxygen to his lungs.  ”There are not words for what this means to us. It is our honor to help and we honor you all,” the blood center wrote back in response on Facebook.   For Michael Stack that small vial of blood meant his father could finally get the   respect and service fitting a man of his stature. ”We waited long enough, and we know it was done right today,” Michael Stack said. ”Everyone in the Catholic faith deserves a massive Catholic burial.  Well . .. we got it.” ’I think they’re gonna need us’ Larry Stack was putting the finishing touches on a fire investigation report when a plane crashed into the World Trade Center.  He and others ran to the roof of their ladder company in Brooklyn to see what was going on, according to his son, Michael.   ”While on the roof, my father was watching the burning North Tower though a pair of binoculars, when all of a sudden, a second plane crashed into the South Tower,” Michael Stack said, having heard accounts from his father’s  .   Larry Stack turned to everybody on the roof, and said, ”I think they’re gonna need us over there,” according to Michael.   ”My dad called my mom as they headed over the Brooklyn Bridge, to tell her that he loved her, and to not make dinner that night,” Michael said.   Once at the scene, Larry Stack narrowly escaped the collapse of the South Tower.  His firefighter’s coat became stuck, and he wiggled his way out of it, leaving the coat behind. He also helped free a lieutenant who was pinned under debris and helped him and another lieutenant through a stairwell to an exit.  He told the two lieutenants to run as fast as they could, and keep running.   By the stairwell exit, Larry Stack then came across an injured man, who he feared had a severed Achilles tendon and couldn’t move. The two lieutenants came back and offered to help, but the battalion chief again told them to run.   ”My father stayed with the man, probably telling him all the while, everything was going to be all right,” Michael said, his steady voice breaking as he remembered his father’s sacrifice. ”The North Tower collapsed.  He never left that man,” Michael Stack told  .   ’Loud and clear’ In the 15 years since   New York City has seen two new mayors.  One World Trade Center, built near the site of ground zero, has added a new beacon to the city’s iconic skyline.  Two memorial fountains now sit where the twin towers once stood.   Michael Stack, then a young FDNY upstart, is now a lieutenant with a wife and four children.   Of the 343 FDNY members who lost their lives on September 11, remains of 127 have never been recovered.   On Friday, funeral services for Larry Stack at a church on Long Island provided some closure for a family that has been grieving for 15 years.  Burial at a military cemetery also on Long Island will take place later.  ”He’s finally being laid to rest, in a place he rightfully earned,” Michael said.  ”The dead can’t speak, but when you go to a place like Arlington National, Cypress Hills, or Calverton (Cemetery) where my dad’s going, those headstones speak loud and clear to me.” Larry’s widow, Terri, wept quietly as she followed a casket draped with an American flag out of the funeral service Friday.  She was surrounded by her family, and members of the FDNY.  She wore a white dress.   Friday would have been Larry and Terri’s 49th wedding anniversary. "
Knicks Acquire Oft-Injured Derrick Rose From the Bulls - The New York Times,"In a move designed to upgrade a conspicuously ineffectual backcourt, the Knicks completed a blockbuster deal with the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday and acquired point guard Derrick Rose, who won the Most Valuable Player Award in 2011 before struggling with a string of serious knee injuries. In exchange for Rose  —   as well as guard Justin Holiday and a 2017   draft pick  —   the Knicks sent center Robin Lopez, point guard Jose Calderon and point guard Jerian Grant to the Bulls. “This is an exciting day for New York and our fans,” Knicks Coach Jeff Hornacek said in a statement sent out by the team. “Derrick is one of the top point guards in the N. B. A. who is   . He adds a whole new dynamic to our roster and immediately elevates our backcourt. ” The acquisition of Rose, 27, splashy as it was, came   of question marks for the Knicks. At the least, the move added another alluring boldface name to a team that already featured Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis. Rose, who was named rookie of the year in 2009 and made the   team the next three seasons, has long been one of the most recognizable faces in the league. Yet many believe Rose’s best seasons are in the past, and he has been known better over the last few years for his lengthy stints on the Bulls’ disabled list. He played in only 100 games from the   season to the   season and sat out the entire   campaign. Last season, he appeared in 66 games for the Bulls and averaged 16. 4 points and 4. 7 assists in 31. 8 minutes per game. Rose was also accused of sexual battery in a lawsuit filed last year by a former girlfriend who charged that he and two other men had drugged her and sexually assaulted her in 2013. Rose has denied the allegations, and a trial is scheduled to begin in October. Whatever risks or rewards Rose may bring, his tenure with the Knicks could be short. He has one year left on his contract, with a base salary of about $21. 3 million for the coming season. Holiday, a       guard, averaged 4. 5 points in 53 games for the Atlanta Hawks and the Bulls last season. As the Knicks tried to solidify their backcourt, they created another hole in their roster with the departure of Lopez. The move could compel them to pursue a   big man in the coming weeks. Lopez joined the team as a free agent last summer and, after a slow start, found his stride in the second half of the season. He started all 82 games and averaged 10. 3 points and 7. 3 rebounds. His bruising presence at the center position allowed Porzingis, a rookie last season, to adjust to the pace and physicality of the N. B. A. Calderon, 34, started 72 games for the Knicks and averaged 7. 6 points and 4. 2 assists. Grant, 23, was a   pick in the 2015 draft. He inherited the starting point guard job from Calderon in the final days of the Knicks’   season, which they finished  . The Knicks also announced on Wednesday that they had waived guard Tony Wroten. Into that newly vacated space arrives Rose, who was born in Chicago and played one season at Memphis before becoming the No. 1 pick in the 2008 N. B. A. draft. Rose exploded into the N. B. A. and became the youngest player to win the league’s M. V. P. Award at 22. He was a physical dynamo in those early years. He sprang and slashed in his signature drives to the hoop, and his overwhelming athleticism helped to mask his deficiencies shooting from outside. Rose played in 240 games in his first three seasons in the league, and he averaged 20. 9 points and 6. 7 assists in that time. A spate of injuries in recent years has kept him from reaching those same heights. It began in the   season. The Bulls finished that season tied for the best record in the league. But in the first game of the postseason, Rose tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, and he missed all of the following season as a result of the injury. In November 2013, just 10 games into the season, Rose tore the meniscus of his right knee and missed the rest of the season. He sustained the same injury in February 2015, the following season, and missed 20 more games. Last September, he sustained a fracture in his left eye socket after taking an elbow to the face in practice and had to undergo yet another operation. The sum of those injuries left him a shadow of his former self once he returned to the court. He has a chance to   in the spotlight next season with the Knicks."
GOP congressman to Trump: Apologize," (CNN) As two US government officials told CNN that a classified Justice Department report to Congress fails to confirm President Donald Trump’s claim of wiretapping by former President Barack Obama, a Republican congressman had one suggestion for Trump: Apologize. During an interview Friday night on CNN’s ”OutFront,” Erin Burnett asked Republican Rep. Will Hurd whether Trump owed Obama an apology for the unproven allegation. Hurd replied, ”I’m going to quote my father, Bob Hurd, and something that he’s told all of my friends when they got married    it never hurts to say you’re sorry.” Asked whether he wished Trump issued the apology Friday during a news conference where he stood by the claim, Hurd said: ”He’s the President of the United States. He can do what he thinks is in his best interest, but this is something that will probably linger.” Hurd, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said he has not yet seen the DOJ report that was sent to Congress on the wiretapping allegation, but was not surprised by its apparent contents. ”I think it’s been pretty clear that there’s no evidence to suggest that” Obama wiretapped Trump Tower, Hurd said. FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers are set to testify Monday at a House Intelligence Committee hearing, which Hurd called ”  TV.” Hurd, who also sits on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, also weighed in on news that a Secret Service laptop with floor plans and evacuation protocol for Trump Tower was stolen from an agent’s car.  He called it a ”troubling” and ”very serious” security lapse, cautioning that ”when one Secret Service agent shows a lapse like this, it affects the entire organization.”"

Part of Cruz’s success on Saturday could be due to the Maine and Kansas’ caucus format, which require voters to show up at a specific time and stay longer than traditional primary elections. Cruz previously defeated Trump in the Iowa and Alaska caucuses.” ”This weekend’s two Cruz wins boost Cruz’s argument that he, not fellow Sen.

FAKE NEWS: Sean Spicer Trashes New York Times ’Bathrobe’ Report - Breitbart,"White House press secretary Sean Spicer ridiculed a story published by the New York Times that reported that President Donald Trump spends a lot of time in the White House watching television in his bathrobe. [“I don’t think the president owns a bathrobe,” Spicer told reporters aboard Air Force One in response to the story. “He definitely doesn’t wear one. ”  The story reported that Trump was struggling being “cloistered” inside the White House, and that his senior aides were having difficulty adjusting to their new roles in the White House  —   and to each other. But Spicer accused the reporters of getting the story horribly wrong, calling it “literally the epitome of fake news. ” “That story was so riddled with inaccuracies and lies that they owe the president an apology,” he said. “Literally blatant factual errors and it’s unacceptable to see that kind of reporting or   reporting. ” Spicer accused the New York Times reporters of failing their readers by printing unsubstantiated rumors. “From top to bottom it made up stories that don’t exist and I think that’s unfortunate for people that look to news institutions like that for their news,” he said."
President Barack Obama commutes sentences of 46 drug offenders,"Washington (CNN) President Barack Obama commuted the prison sentences of 46 drug offenders, saying in a video posted online Monday that the men and women were not ”hardened criminals” and their punishments didn’t match the crimes they committed. Obama said the move was part of his larger attempt to reform the criminal justice system, including reviewing sentencing laws and reducing punishments for   crimes. With Monday’s announcement, Obama has commuted more sentences than any president since Lyndon B. Johnson. ”I believe that at its heart, America is a nation of second chances, and I believe these folks deserve their second chance,” Obama said in the video. The move brings the number of Obama’s commutations to nearly 90. Most of those have been for federal prisoners incarcerated for drug offenses who were slapped with long sentences mandated under guidelines set during a    wave in the 1980s. Under current sentencing guidelines most of those prisoners would have already finished serving time. Of the 46 prisoners whose sentences were commuted on Monday, 13 were sentenced to prison for life. Most of those commuted sentences will now end in November, a several month transition period that officials said allowed for arrangements to be made in halfway homes and other facilities. After they’re released, the former prisoners will be supervised by probation officers and subject to conditions that were set during their original sentencing, which is some cases includes drug testing. The new round of commutations comes after 22 prisoners convicted of drug crimes were granted release earlier this year. In late 2014, eight criminals were granted commutations. RELATED: Obama commutes eight drug offenders’ sentences, why not others? Unlike a presidential pardon, a commutation does not erase a criminal conviction, only reduces a sentence. In his presidency Obama has granted 64 pardons. The White House on Monday posted a letter Obama wrote to each of the 46 men and women whose sentences were commuted. ”I am granting your application because you have demonstrated the potential to turn your life around,” Obama wrote. ”Now it is up to you to make the most of this opportunity. It will not be easy, and you will confront many who doubt people with criminal records can change. Perhaps even you are unsure of how you will adjust to your new circumstances. But remember that you have the capacity to make good choices.” Later this week, Obama is expected to discuss his plans for criminal justice reform further. He travels Tuesday to Philadelphia to speak at the annual convention of the NAACP, and on Thursday will become the first president to visit a federal prison when he tours the El Reno facility in Oklahoma.  While there, he’s expected to cite bipartisan calls for chances to the criminal justice system that would reduce overcrowding in prisons and create a system where sentences better match the crimes they are meant to punish. The effort to reform the system has gained support from Republicans like Sen. Rand Paul, the   presidential candidate, and David and Charles Koch, the industrialist brothers who have spent millions on conservative causes. ”Over the last few years a lot of people have become aware of the inequities in the criminal justice system,” Obama said in the video. ”Right now, with our overall crime rate and incarceration rate both falling, we’re at a moment when some good people in both parties, Republicans and Democrats and folks all across the country, are coming up with ideas to make the system work smarter and better.”"
WikiLeaks: Adviser Wanted Hillary Clinton to Address ‘Political Corruption’ - Breitbart,"WikiLeaks’ release of an email from the account of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta shows Clinton adviser Neera Tanden recommending the candidate deliver “a big speech” focusing on how she would address the problem of political corruption in the primary against Bernie Sanders. [On February 17, 2016, Tanden wrote to Jake Sullivan, the Clinton campaign’s top foreign policy adviser, and Podesta on the subject of “political corruption”:  I know we have to get through Nevada and South Carolina, but after that, can we do a big speech, maybe near Congress, on changing the way we do business? I was looking at some of the open ended responses in the story in USA Today on their national poll, and how Sanders people think she’s kowtowing to big corporations who fund her. Can she break through that by outlining an agenda to make Congress work for the people again: stricter laws on bribery ban lobbyists literally from the capital building, or just report out all meetings she would probably have to do something on her own fundraising. Should I work some ideas up? ..seems like we need to do something in this space. I briefed the caucus and the Sen Dem message group on our trust in government stuff  …    Schumer, Klobuchar, Warren really got it. Tanden referenced an article at USA Today on the same day that highlighted Sanders’ jump to within 10 percentage points of Clinton for the Democrat Party nomination. According to the article, one poll respondent from Austin commented he was inclined to vote for Sanders over Clinton in light of Clinton’s fundraising from big corporations. “I’m kind of weary of her,” Kevin Baugh said. “It makes me uncomfortable to support a candidate who is potentially in the pocket of big corporations. ” Similarly, Tom Eberhardt of Wisconsin said about Clinton, “I’m not crazy about the fact that she’s such an establishment politician. ” Sullivan responded to Tanden, “I am for you working up some ideas. I am into this. ”"
Ted Cruz: Trump ‘Is Blatantly Lying to You and Laughing About It’ - Breitbart,"Sen. Ted Cruz accused GOP frontrunner Donald Trump of “telling us he’s lying to us” after Trump aides told RNC leaders that their candidate will moderate his message. [“Donald is a New York liberal who is pretending to be a conservative to try to fool Republican primary voters,” Cruz told radio host Mark Levin and his listeners on Thursday. Levin prompted the statement when he referred to senior Trump aide Paul Manafort’s comments in a private meeting and asking Cruz, “Who the hell is Donald Trump?”  Trump’s senior aide, Paul Manafort, gave Republican National Committee members a new vision of a more moderate Trump to come: “The part that he’s been playing is evolving into the part that now you’ve been expecting, but he wasn’t ready for, because he had first to complete the first phase. The negatives will come down. The image is going to change. ” The Associated Press reported on the meeting after obtaining a recording of the   exchange. On Levin’s show, Cruz gave Trump “a little bit of credit” for being candid: “He’s telling us he’s lying to us. ” Trump has repeatedly branded Cruz as “lyin’ Ted. ” Cruz’s campaign slogan is “TrusTed. ” Cruz hit on the “lyin’ Trump” theme again on Friday, telling   in Williamsport, Pennsylvania that Trump is “trying to fool gullible voters,” according to reporter Betsy Klein. He repeated the statement that Trump is “telling us he’s lying to us. ” During the Levin interview, Cruz brought up words from Trump supporter Ben Carson and reports of Trump’s off the record meeting with the New York Times, calling it all “an act, a show. ” Cruz accused Trump of telling the NYT that “he’s not going to build a wall, he’s not going to deport the people here illegally. ” Trump supporter and former presidential candidate himself, Ben Carson, told the RNC members in Florida that Trump is “trying to moderate. He’s getting better,” reported the AP. Cruz told Levin and his listeners, “If you’re tired of being lied to you oughta at least listen to it when Donald Trump tells us he’s lying to us and that’s why I think the right thing for a voter to do is not listen to campaign rhetoric, but instead look for a record. You want someone who’ll stand up to immigration? Ask who led the fight against the Gang of 8 amnesty plan and led the effort to defeat it in congress. I was leading that effort against amnesty when Donald Trump was funding the Gang of 8 amnesty plan. ” Levin, who has endorsed Cruz, played a clip of Trump’s Today Show comments criticizing North Carolina’s new transgender bathroom bill. Cruz commented, “Donald Trump is explicitly agreeing with Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. They have the same views on religious liberty. ” He said that as a father it’s just “common sense” that he doesn’t want grown men in the bathroom with his little girls. Cruz called it the “political correctness that we have seen the last seven years. ” He made similar comments during an interview on the Glenn Beck radio program, “It is only the lunacy of political correctness  —  if he had fired Curt Schilling —  for making the rather obvious point, that we shouldn’t allow grown adult men strangers alone in a bathroom with little girls. ” Levin then pointed to a clip in the Today Show interview in which Trump said he agreed when asked if he believes in raising taxes on the wealthy. Levin commented that talk of taxing the wealthy usually means the middle class. He then asked Cruz, “Raising taxes on the ‘wealthy,’ doesn’t that go against his own proposed tax plan?” Cruz accused Trump of not knowing what’s in his own tax plan: “He hired some staffer to write a tax plan to pretend to be conservative. It’s not a very well thought out tax plan, he doesn’t know the details. ” He went on to say Trump supported President Obama’s Wall Street bailout and accused Trump of being in favor of socialized healthcare. In February, Trump posted a lengthy message to Facebook refuting accusations that he holds positions that are not conservative. In it he called Cruz “a totally unstable individual” and “the single biggest liar I’ve ever come across. ” Cruz brought up Trump’s stated intention to amend the   plank of the Republican platform and “even today supports taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood. ” “These are the views of a big government, New York liberal,” Cruz asserted. He also claimed “Donald Trump wrote the checks to fund” Obamacare. “If you’re tired of being lied to, it doesn’t make any sense to support the guy who is blatantly lying to you and laughing about it,” Cruz claimed. “He is making fun of us right now, the American people. He thinks we’re gullible and he thinks if he yells and screams and curses and uses language that insults everybody that somehow people will think he’s really a conservative  …    ” Earlier in the show Levin asked Cruz to tell Trump to come on the radio show after two to three months of absence if the candidates cross paths on the campaign trail. “It’s now been 43 days since the last debate,” said Cruz. The Texas senator accused Trump of avoiding Levin’s show because Levin “won’t kiss his behind,” but will “ask difficult questions. ” Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana "
"Manuel Noriega, former dictator of Panama, dies"," (CNN) Manuel Noriega, the former Panamanian dictator and convicted drug trafficker who was once one of Central America’s most notorious military strongmen, has died, according to a tweet by Panama’s President Juan Carlos Varela on his verified Twitter account. Noriega, 83, had undergone surgery in a Panama City hospital on March 7 to remove a benign brain tumor. He was placed in a medically induced coma after suffering severe brain hemorrhaging during the surgery, his attorney told CNN affiliate TV Panama at the time.  Noriega, once on friendly terms with the United States because of his country’s location on the Panama Canal, became a US target as relations deteriorated. The United States invaded Panama in 1989 and Noriega was convicted of drug charges in 1991. He spent almost 20 years in US prisons before extradition to France and, ultimately, back to Panama.  Military man, Noriega was born on February 11, 1934, in Panama City, Panama. Abandoned by his parents at age 5, Noriega was raised by his aunt until he left to pursue a career in the military. He began his career as a lieutenant in the Panama National Guard and quickly rose in rank. Noriega served as head of military intelligence to Gen. Omar Torrijos, who seized power in a military coup in 1968. Torrijos died in a plane crash in 1981, and Noriega emerged as his successor. In 1983 Noriega took command of the Panamanian Army and installed himself as Panama’s leader. The country’s location was critical to the United States because of its location on the Panama Canal, a key strategic and economic waterway between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Due to this regional importance, the US had a vested interest in maintaining good relations with the Central American nation. Despite the incentives to maintain these relations, the 1980s saw a breakdown between the two countries, with Washington cutting off economic and military assistance and freezing Panamanian government assets. ’Trial of the century’ In 1989, Noriega was indicted in the United States on charges of racketeering, laundering drug money and drug trafficking. He was accused of having links to Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar’s notorious Medellin cartel and, in the process, amassing a   fortune. Amid growing unrest in Panama, US President George H. W. Bush ordered the invasion of Panama    codenamed ”Operation Just Cause”    in December 1989, saying Noriega’s rule posed a threat to US lives and property. With more than 20, 000 US troops on Panamanian soil, Noriega took refuge in the Vatican embassy in Panama City for 10 days, eventually surrendering to US Drug Enforcement Administration officials on January 3, 1990 after US troops had surrounded the compound with loudspeakers playing deafening rock music. Noriega’s trial in 1991 was dubbed the drugs ”trial of the century” by the US Drug Enforcement Administration and eventually saw him found guilty on eight counts and sentenced to 40 years in jail.  Health crises, Noriega was the first foreign head of state to be convicted in a US court, and the trial also led to revelations that Noriega had been a paid CIA asset for many years.  ”It’s wrong what people say    that you can buy him,” said Ambler Moss, the former US ambassador to Panama. ”You can’t buy him, but you can sure as hell rent him.” Noriega had since said his relationship with the United States soured when he refused to participate in   efforts spearheaded by the CIA in Central America during the 1980s The CIA has not commented on Noriega’s claims. ”You are a good person so long as you say yes. However, once you say no, then you become an evil guy,” Noriega recollected in a 1992 interview with CNN. Noriega was granted prisoner of war status after his trial, and his sentence was later reduced to 30 years.  He was due for release on parole in 2007, but he was held pending a decision on a French extradition request    a Paris court had convicted Noriega in absentia in 1999 on charges that he had laundered $2. 8 million in drug money by buying property in France. As part of an extradition deal in April 2010 and signed by   of State Hillary Clinton, France agreed to hold a new trial and to uphold Noriega’s prisoner of war status. After his extradition to Panama from France in 2011, Noriega dealt with several health crises, including a possible stroke in 2012.  Noriega apologizes, While serving his sentence in Panama he sued Activision Blizzard, makers of the popular Call of Duty videogame series, after one edition featured a mission to capture him.  His portrayal ”as a kidnapper, murderer and enemy of the state” in the game damaged his reputation, he alleged, and argued that he was entitled to a share of the game’s profits. A California judge dismissed the suit.  In 2015, he apologized to his country for the offenses of his regime and his own actions that led up to the 1989 US invasion, and his ouster. Noriega is survived by his wife, Felicidad Sieiro and three daughters Sandra, Thays and Lorena."
"California School Bans Tag, Says Game ‘Too Rough’ - Breitbart","Gold Ridge Elementary School in Folsom, California has banned the game of tag. [Principle David Frankel sent a note home to parents saying, “Students were instructed that physical contact including tag games, touch football, etc. were not allowed on the yard. ”  Why would this   tradition of playground fun get the axe? According to school district spokesman Daniel Thigpen, things had gotten just a bit too physical. Thigpen explained, “In this case, kids were getting too rough  …    so the school told them to stop playing those games  …     It’s not uncommon for a school to enact specific recess rules to address specific behavior problems. ” Students will face disciplinary action should they not comply. The punishments will begin with a referral, and then a   conference, according to school officials. According to The Daily Mail, the school has claimed that the note was only sent home to some parents, and there’s some confusion over whether the ban applies to all students.   Mallory Giddens is not a fan of the new rule. Giddens told KOVR television, “I don’t really like it. I mean I don’t really play tag but I don’t think it’s fair to everyone else that plays tag!” Giddens continued, “My principal, he doesn’t want us to have tag at school because people, they touch too hard. Sometimes they push people over and my principal doesn’t want anyone getting hurt. ” Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn"
"After Rash of Islamist Killings, Bangladesh High Court Considers Eliminating Islam as State Religion","After a recent spate of killings of members of religious minorities by Islamic extremists, the supreme court of Bangladesh has begun hearing arguments challenging Islam’s privileged status as official state religion, a measure applauded by religious liberty activists and minority leaders. [In 1988, Bangladesh’s military government amended the country’s constitution to declare Islam as the official state religion. That very same year, a group of 15 prominent writers, former judges, educators and cultural activists filed a petition contesting the legitimacy of the move, but the courts did not act to review the petition until now.  In recent months Bangladesh has experienced a “surge in killings” of members of Hindu, Christian and Shi’ite religious minorities, which authorities have said are the work of Islamic extremist groups. Despite warnings from U. S. intelligence that the Islamic State is stepping up recruitment activity in the South Asian country, the Bangladeshi government has insisted that its Islamist problems are home grown. “We have made arrests on each and every     attack,” said one Bangladesh police official. “The attackers have confessed their crimes in court. They have also confessed being a Jamaatul Mujahedin Bangladesh member, and denied any linkage with ISIS,” he said. On February 29, Bangladesh’s Supreme Court officially began hearing arguments on the petition disputing the constitutionality of the adoption of Islam as the state religion. Bangladesh’s original constitution, adopted soon after the nation split from Pakistan in 1971, declared the country to be a secular state. It was the military ruler H. M. Ershard who decreed Islam to be the state religion in 1988, inserting an eighth amendment to the constitution to that effect. The legality of that move is what is now being disputed. Religious minority leaders have commended the high court’s move to reexamine the state religion issue. Bishop Bejoy N. D’Cruze of Sylhet, chairman of the Catholic bishops’ Christian Unity and Interreligious Dialogue Commission, said that the decision to review the petition inspires great hope for religious minorities. “When a state officially accepts a state religion, then it puts barricades for communal harmony because it recognizes supremacy of a particular religion and makes other religions inferior,” D’Cruze said, adding that recent extremist attacks on religious minorities are an indirect consequence of the adoption of a state religion. “We hope and demand that every religion in Bangladesh are put on an equal footing in terms of status and respect,” he said. Another religious leader, Govinda Chadra Pramanik, secretary of Bangladesh National Hindu Grand Alliance, said that by sponsoring Islam as the official religion, the state has created grounds for the persecution of minorities, especially Hindus. “The state religion established the supremacy of Islam over other religions, offering a weapon to radical Islamists to abuse minority communities. Moreover, Islam gets more attention from the state, not other religions, which is an obstacle to interfaith harmony,” he said. “As the state religion, Islam put psychological pressure on minorities, and makes them vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. The court must come to the right decision and withdraw it,” he added. Muslims make up some 90 percent of Bangladesh’s population, while Hindus account for 8 percent and other religions —  including Buddhism and Christianity —  make up the rest. Follow Thomas D.

Rebuilding Australia’s ’cultural cathedrals’,"Sydney, Australia (CNN) From my house I can see the waves breaking on Sydney’s iconic Bondi Beach, where people from all walks of life duck and weave between the surf and board riders dance on the water.  Australia’s beaches are the most egalitarian of public spaces and the hundreds of surf life saving clubs that punctuate their shores reflect this community.  These remarkable pieces of national architecture    many of which were built more than a century ago by volunteer labor    save lives, bridge age and social divides and bring communities together through a love of the ocean and a cold beer.  For many Australians surf clubs have become modern day cathedrals at the center of coastal town squares. But as time and the elements take their toll, a number of these buildings are falling apart, prompting a resurgence in renovation that is bringing fresh life    and beautiful design    to many of these communities by the sea.  Read this: Australia’s ’national love affair’: The pool, Egalitarian   The Australian surf club is a unique beast. They welcome anyone as a member    as long as they are willing to give up weekends to volunteer, patrolling the local beach and rescuing distressed swimmers from the sea.  North Bondi Surf Life Saving Club, where I have been a member for more than 30 years, is one of the founding clubs in this surf lifesaving movement.  Its illustrious alumni include Olympians, judges, barristers and the current Prime Minister, all of whom rub shoulders with tradesmen, council workers, and even humble architects.  These clubs literally save lives, providing the training and coordination that ensures Australia’s treacherous beaches remain patrolled, and    through the Nippers program    give young Australians the skills and respect for mother nature they need to thrive and survive in the waves.  They also provide a community service by offering amenities for swimmers and surfers, storage for life saving equipment and a place for a drink or meal with your mates. All done on minimal government funding and a lot of volunteer fundraising.  Voluntary design principals, This voluntary nature of the clubs is critical, and when it came time to   North Bondi’s own surf club, it was an issue top of my mind. Our clubhouse also sits on one of the most prominent and expensive pieces of real estate on the east coast of Australia, making the redesign a terrifying prospect for the architectural team we put together.   Given this, we developed five key design principles that every development sketch was weighed against.  First, it had to stay true to its purpose and serve as a house of Australian surf lifesaving with practical, open spaces    and at least one bar.  As there was no dominant surrounding architectural style, the design was driven by nature’s   moods and the natural sweeping curves of Bondi.  The building also needed to be ”future proof” so that it would hopefully stand for 200 years and have a layout that included entertainment areas to provide a stream of income to finance the building into the future. Read this: The world’s most remote community? It also had to be on budget    we were designing this building during the height of the Global Financial Crisis and while surf clubs receive local, state and sometimes federal funding, the majority of rebuild costs were coming from the pockets of its volunteer members. Lastly, the new building had to have an ”X factor”. Given that it sits on one of the most recognized beaches in the world, it had to make a statement. Rebuilding an icon, The team of architects, engineers and fundraisers that came together for the rebuild all shared a grand vision for the new North Bondi Surf Club, and    like the builders of the original wooden clubhouse constructed at the turn of the 20th century    we all worked on ’mates’ rates’ or for free.  In this way, the North Bondi redesign is indicative of what makes the rebuilding of Australian surf clubs truly unique.  Great architecture through the ages has usually been the domain of either the church, state or big business in association with philanthropy.  But the rebuilding of many clubs in recent years    and the voluntary fundraising that has helped drive many of them    demonstrates this does not always have to be the case.  Great community architecture can be achieved if necessity demands it. Given their locations and place in society, Australian surf clubs are the cultural cathedrals of a nation that worships the ocean. Through architecture they should aim to encapsulate the age and imbue the egalitarian spirit of Australia. Scroll through the gallery above for some of Colquhoun’s favorite surf club designs. "
"In first foreign swing, Trump works to reposition US allies","Jerusalem (CNN) Touring the Middle East this week, President Donald Trump has sought to galvanize traditional US allies against a common foe Iran, an opening bid to realign the region while advancing the prospect of peace that’s long eluded American leaders. It’s a strategy that also comes with a new promise to US allies: the longstanding emphasis on democratic values, which US presidents have long pressed in talks with autocratic regimes, will no longer stand in the way of deepening ties. It’s a pronounced break with his predecessor, Barack Obama, who worked while in office to engage Tehran hoping to bring about the same goal of peace. The move was consistent with other attempts around the globe to engage countries with   ties to the US, a practice that seems to have ended when Trump took office. For a President whose first months in office have been marked by a frenzied pace but little policy direction, Trump’s move to realign traditional US allies in a united front against Iran amounts to one of the first firm outlines of a doctrine that, until now, has been rooted primarily in flexibility. It’s also one that comes with risks, including further isolating a country whose destabilization campaign extends into the regions worst crises. ”I can see a much deeper path to friendship with Israel” and Arab nations, Trump said after arriving here Monday. ”A lot of it’s spurred on by what’s happening with Iran.” The reemphasis on traditional US alliances here has drawn broad welcome from Arab and Israeli leaders, who offered outsized praise for Trump despite few details for his plans moving forward. On Monday, there was one tangible sign that a US bid to align Arab nations and Israel was progressing: Trump flew in Air Force One directly from Riyadh to Tel Aviv Sunday, an historic flight between two countries long at odds. ’A terrible, terrible thing’ Speaking in Jerusalem, Trump offered the most overt criticism of his predecessor yet on his foreign swing, declaring the agreement Obama helped broker to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions a profound failure that had animated the country to support terror. ”Instead of saying thank you to the United States, they now feel emboldened,” Trump said as he prepared to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose strident opposition to the Iran deal caused nearly irreparable rifts with Obama.  ”It was a terrible, terrible thing for the United States to enter that deal,” Trump said as Netanyahu nodded in agreement. ”And believe me, Iran will never have a nuclear weapon. That I can tell you.” While Trump campaigned as an ardent opponent of the Iran accord, his administration has not taken steps to formally scrap the agreement as promised. A review of the plan is underway, and Trump’s State Department has said that elements of the pact are working. But as Trump has moved across the Middle East, his message on the deal hasn’t wavered. He declared to Muslim political leaders in Riyadh that any attempt to engage Iran’s government was misguided  and could produce further instability. ”Until the Iranian regime is willing to be a partner for peace, all nations of conscience must work together to isolate it, deny it, funding for terrorism, cannot do it, and pray for the day when the Iranian people have the just and righteous government they so richly deserve,” Trump said during the speech, which gathered the leaders of more than 50 Muslim nations in the Gulf for a summit on countering extremism. ’Working together’ White House officials said after Trump’s slate of meetings in Saudi Arabia Sunday that they were surprised at the level of professed desire among Arab Gulf states to partner with Israel in countering Iran’s aggressions.  ”They’re working together extremely cooperatively, and also working incredible well with Israel. I kept hearing that over and over again in all of the bilateral meetings,” one official said, speaking anonymously to describe private talks. The sessions in Riyadh came days after Iran reelected its leader, Hassan Rouhani, a victory for a moderate who some western leaders hope can bring needed reforms to the country. Part of Obama’s objective in brokering the nuclear deal was to bring the country to a global negotiating table, thereby establishing channels for diplomacy. Loosening sanctions in exchange for a curtailment of the nuclear program allowed a flow of western capital and goods into Iran, which Obama and his partners hoped could better integrate Iran’s 80 million citizens with the rest of the world. This week, Trump has signaled that the mode of foreign engagement focusing on fostering Democratic ideals is ending. ”We are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be, or how to worship,” Trump said in Saudi Arabia. ”Instead, we are here to offer partnership based on shared interests and values to pursue a better future.” Symbolic power, Obama used the symbolic power of presidential travel during his eight years in office to highlight and prod for democratic progress abroad. Navigating Air Force One to capitals in Myanmar, Cuba, Vietnam and Laos, Obama hoped to improve US security by luring autocratic governments to change their ways.  Countries where relations with the US had frozen, like Iran and Cuba, were brought to the negotiating table with the hope engagement could spur the beginnings of democratic reform. Allies in Europe, skeptical of US power after George W. Bush’ intervention in Iraq, were given a full embrace. ”There’s a danger of   and overcorrecting on this,” said Antony Blinken, a deputy secretary of state in the Obama administration. ”We have to walk a very fine line between on the one hand making sure we are pushing back against Iran’s objectionable activities, but not closing the door on a relationship as this country evolves, because that will only reinforce all of the hard liners in the country who want to keep Iran stuck in the past.” ”That’s the line the President has to walk, and it’s difficult to do that if you’re actually putting all of your focus on bringing people together in this crusade against Iran,” Blinken said."
Vanity Fair: National Politics Are all About Donald Trump’s Wall - Breitbart,"The fate of Donald Trump’s presidency depends on whether Sen. Chuck Schumer can block construction of the border wall, says Vanity Fair. [The magazine’s writer, T. A. Frank, is a liberal with some understanding of the Trump coalition and he argues that the Democrats hope to break Trump’s presidency by blocking funds for the wall:  Thwart Trump and he looks weak. You force him to break his signature promise. His agenda stalls. The Hispanic vote moves even more solidly to the left. The Democratic base gets energized, and Trump’s base gets demoralized and stays home in the next couple of elections. It’s  . That’s why Chuck Schumer has spoken of “shutting down the government” if Trump tries to get the wall going   …     People are now suggesting Trump has given up on the wall in all but rhetoric. And this would be momentous. If Trump’s wall is dead, then Trump’s presidency is dead, But Trump is still trying to get funds for the wall, in the face of uniform and public Democratic opposition plus widespread   opposition from GOP leaders. In a Friday, April 28 speech to the National Rifle Association, for example, he declared that: “We’ll build a wall. Don’t even think about [not getting a wall]. Don’t even think about it. Don’t even think about it. That’s an easy one. ” Amid unified Democratic opposition, Trump only has two choices, argues Vanity Fair: Trump’s options are limited. He could in theory play —  or have played —  a ruthless game to get his way, since Trump has the power to revoke the “deferred action for childhood arrivals” or DACA order that Barack Obama signed in order to shield those who have arrived here illegally as children. An icier type wouldn’t have hesitated to hold the fate of these people hostage for wall funding, employing rhetoric about the importance of tying today’s forgiveness to tomorrow’s prevention, and so on. But Trump shows few signs of being that callous, and he has conveyed only reassurances to the Dreamers. So threats of this sort will not be his approach. The second option would be to try to sell the wall —  and do a better job of it than he did with Ryancare   …     Trump could try to sell people on a vision of America with tighter labor markets [that push up higher wages] more equitable distribution of wealth, and less [civic] balkanization   …     He could pair this with a pitch for the wall, arguing that walls are peaceful and usually effective, and they reduce the need for more intrusive forms of enforcement such as workplace raids and deportation. But Trump has only figured out how to use the wall to sell himself. He never figured out how to use himself to sell the wall. Democrats oppose the wall, in large part, because it is an effective barrier that future politicians can’t remove, and is also a concrete symbol of Americans’ determination to block the flow of cheap labor,   customers, renters and future voters from Mexico to   cities along the coasts. But Trump also faces a huge problem in getting top GOP leaders to fund his plans for a wall, because the wall would shrink the flow of illegal immigrants sought by many business groups in Texas, Georgia and other red states. Throughout April, that   GOP opposition meant that GOP leaders failed to push Democrats to approve Trump’s request to build an additional 48 miles of border barrier in 2017. The requested $1 billion was blocked by Democrats, although congressional leaders say Trump will get the extra funds for other homeland security tasks in the 2017 supplemental budget, now slated for approval in early May. The   GOP opposition is cloaking itself as a supporter of alternatives to Trump’s permanent    barrier, such as an invisible fence of expensive sensors and border patrol agents which later can be switched off as soon as Trump leaves the White House. A wall “really means ‘security’   …     It could be open surveillance to prevent people from crossing,” Florida GOP Rep. Dennis Ross told Bloomberg in December. “It does not mean an actual wall. ” “I’ve always thought the wall was a metaphor for securing the border,” not an actual wall, claimed Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson during an April CNN interview. “There will never be a   wall built, period,” claimed South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, a   Republican. “I think it’s become symbolic of better border security. It’s a code word for better border security. If you make it about actually building a   wall, that’s a bridge too far. ” “I think a wall is anything that will stop people from coming into the country illegally,” claimed Pennsylvania GOP Rep. Lou Barletta. “It could be a variety of what can be used to be successful. ” House Speaker Paul Ryan is also downplaying the wall part of the wall. “Conditions on the ground determine what you need in a particular area,” he told CBS’s “60 Minutes. ” Immigration reformers are pushing Trump to fight for wall funding in the 2018 budget, due in October. “Construction of a border wall was one of the president’s signature promises during his campaign,” said a statement from the Federation for American Immigration Reform. As he has made clear, an effective border security plan would include a wall in areas of the border where it is a viable and effective deterrent and that other sections of the border would be enhanced by technology and additional manpower. We expect that the president will deliver on these commitments. Unfortunately, past versions of a ‘comprehensive border security plan’ have been ineffective because they did not require the laying of a single brick of border wall. Such a cosmetic approach was a precursor to amnesty and both have been consistently rejected by the American people. We look forward to seeing details of the president’s plan that will actually get the job done of securing our southern border. ” However, border security is only one component of a needed overhaul of immigration. Much more is expected by the American people and the White House must demand Congress pass meaningful reforms to eliminate the incentives for illegal immigration and create a legal immigration system that truly serves identifiable national interests. ” Read more about the wall here."
Columbia suspends wrestlers over lewd texts,"New York (CNN) Columbia University has suspended members of its wrestling team after a school investigation found they sent lewd and racist group messages and texts.  The entire wrestling program was put on hold earlier this week as the university conducted the inquiry. ”Those responsible for the offensive statements in the group chat have lost the privilege to represent Columbia University in intercollegiate athletics competition,” the school said in a statement on its website. The messages included alleged homophobic and racial slurs as well as crude sexual comments about women. Screen grabs of the alleged messages were published last week on Bwog. com, an independent   campus website.  According to the site, some of the messages are recent and others go back as far as 2014. Thursday, Bwog posted a letter of apology from the team, addressed to ”the Columbia community.” ”All of us apologize, without reservation or condition, to all members of the Columbia community for the creation and dissemination of the inappropriate, vulgar and hurtful text messages which have affected so many members of our community and the overall University,” the team wrote. The letter continued: ”There is no excuse for this behavior. All of us have gained an entirely new perspective on how hurtful the comments made by members of our team truly are. These messages are not just words or playful jokes between teammates. This has been a   call for our team. A culture change was obviously needed    and, rest assured, it will take place.” The   suspended from the team were part of a ”distinct group” within the team, Columbia said. Some team members were suspended through the rest of the season and   academic year others until the beginning of the spring 2017 semester. Members of the team who were found to be uninvolved in the group messaging will be allowed to compete, including at this weekend’s state championship, the school said. The team will work in the future with the executive director of Athlete Ally, which advocates against LGBT discrimination in sports, the school said. ”We sincerely hope these disciplinary actions and ongoing commitments will help Columbia wrestling and all of Columbia’s athletics programs set an example that makes our University proud,” the school wrote in the statement. This is the second such incident this month involving an Ivy League school sports team. Harvard University canceled the remainder of its men’s soccer season after players reportedly used sexually explicit terms to rank female soccer players’ physical appearance. The ”scouting report” evaluated freshmen female soccer players on their looks and sex appeal with numerical scores and offensive descriptions, according to a Harvard Crimson report about the discovery of such a document from 2012. The report prompted a university investigation, which found that the practice was ”widespread across the team” and continued into the 2016 season, Harvard Athletics Director Bob Scalise said in an email to student athletes. Harvard was scheduled to play two more regular season games. It also forfeited any opportunity to vie for the Ivy League championship or to compete in the NCAA tournament. ”We are beyond disappointed that our season has ended in this way, but we respect the decision made by our administration,” Harvard men’s soccer coach Pieter Lehrer said. ”Actions have consequences, and character counts. We accept responsibility for our actions, and I know that we will use the experience of this terribly unfortunate situation to be better.”"
Black Designers in Focus at Fashion Institute of Technology - The New York Times,"What do the satin leotard of the Playboy Bunny, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis’s first wedding gown and a wool jacquard Savile Row suit from 2016 have in common? All were created by people of African descent, a new exhibition, called “Black Fashion Designers,” at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology will gently remind  —   or perhaps inform  —   its visitors. This is far from the first time F. I. T. which takes care to diversify its mannequins and hosted the   Harveys Bristol Cream Tribute to the Black Designer in the 1980s, has honored minorities in the industry. But “a lot of contributions have been overlooked,” Ariele Elia, the assistant curator of costume and textiles, who conceived the show, said during a tour on Tuesday, the day before it opened. “We wanted to bring attention to the history that people have forgotten and show some of the new faces that people might not be familiar with. ” And name the names, which include, corresponding to the garments above: Zelda Wynn Valdes, Ann Lowe and Ozwald Boateng. Making no claim to comprehensiveness, the show nonetheless packs a wide cultural range into a relatively small   space. It is easily navigated, should Ms. Elia be unavailable, with an app introduced by the booming voice of the Vogue contributing editor André Leon Talley, who served on the advisory committee (along with the longtime Ebony commentator Audrey Smaltz, one of many   muses featured). “The show is about black makers, models and designers, as opposed to ‘black style,’ ” said Elizabeth Way, a curatorial assistant who worked with Ms. Elia, underscoring what might today be obvious but bears repeating: “There really isn’t a black style. ” Some designers draw consistently from ancient African traditions, like the   Duru Olowu, whose   ensemble opens the exhibition, and Mimi Plange, from Ghana and then California, whose quilting on a pink dress mimics the body art of scarification and who has been championed (among many other independent designers) by the first lady, Michelle Obama. “This is, like, our last tribute to Michelle,” Ms. Elia said with palpable wistfulness. There are items as casual as the    printed shift designed by Laura Smalls that Mrs. Obama wore in July to do a “Carpool Karaoke” segment with the   talk show host James Corden. And looks as formal as an evening dress designed by Eric Gaskins inspired by the painter Franz Kline, a white column adorned with what looked like big black brush strokes. “Done with tiny microbugle beads!” Ms. Way said. “He crushed them down into almost nothing. ” (In recent years, Mr. Gaskins has been known for crushing the hot klieg lights of the fashion industry down to almost nothing on his addictively candid blog, the Emperor’s Old Clothes.) Some pieces are familiar, thanks to show business celebrities, like a racy black lace gown by LaQuan Smith worn  —   barely  —   by Kim Kardashian to a yacht party in Cannes in 2015, and a   and   minidress by CD Greene that Tina Turner chose for her “Wildest Dream” tour in 1996. “She was having a problem showing up on stage, so she needed something that would really make her shine,” Ms. Way said. Perhaps intuiting their own obsolescence, stars are now requesting something that actually makes them light up, and the young “creative technologist” Madison Maxey has been working on such innovations at her lab in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. But her contribution here is subtler: a    print on hemp whose belt incorporates recycled computer and headphone cords (radically revising the old phrase “waste not, no waist”). Ecological concern also crops up in a   knit from yarn spun out of plastic ocean waste by   Raw, the label   by the musician Pharrell Williams. This is in a section devoted to protest through clothing that showcases Kerby  ’s “They Have Names,” a homage to 13 unarmed black men who were killed by the police. “People are interested in this because it’s so timely,” Ms. Way said, “but we wanted to show that black designers have been working with activism for a very long time. ” Some of this activism centered around AIDS, which felled Karl Davis at 25 after only six collections, the last containing a sleek evening gown with Chanelesque back pockets that stands here as a sober monument to talent not fully realized. And in midcareer, Patrick Kelly, renowned not just for bright button embellishments but for his seizing back of racist figures like the pickaninny and golliwog, and Willi Smith, who found mass success designing for a new wave of working women, mixing patterns with joyful abandon. For a brief shining moment, after advancements in civil rights, there was also newfound freedom after hours at the disco, with its court costumers like Stephen Burrows, he of the lettuce edge (like the Toll House cookie, a happy accident) James Daugherty and Scott Barrie. “Designers were breaking away from structuralism of the ’60s, and getting into something more ” Ms. Way said, then made a sudden break from  . “I think just really it was all about the music. ” But she acknowledged that in the current political climate the show’s title is a provocation  —   or, perhaps, an invitation. “You can say ‘black designers’ but that doesn’t give you any other information,” Ms. Way said. ”Except how much they’ve been left out. ”"
"Pinkerton: Before Trump Nation, There Was Fox Nation: Fox News After Roger Ailes and Bill O’Reilly","I. The Impact of Fox,  An era has come to an end at Fox News. The departure, last year, of Roger Ailes, its founder and CEO for two decades, and the departure, this year, of Bill O’Reilly, its biggest star for two decades, means that Fox will be changing. What’s said of politics is also true of TV: Personnel is policy. Tell me the names of those who are making the decisions about programming, and the names of those who are actually doing the shows, and I’ll tell you, in turn, about the network. Yet now,   and  ’Reilly, Fox’s future is enshrouded in clouds. As we peer through the mist, it’s possible to cite some informed speculation about where Fox is headed, but first, let’s consider where Fox has been, and what it’s done. As we all know, Fox changed the media, and the country, since it was founded in 1996. Most obviously, Fox gave a home to —  and a voice to —  the half of the country that felt ignored, even disdained, by what we have come to call the Main Stream Media. The conservatives on Fox —  there were plenty of liberals, too, on the channel, although they were less memorable —   talked a different language from the conservatives that went before them. That is, prior to Fox in 1996, the leading media engine of conservative and Republican thinking was The Wall Street Journal editorial page. And close behind was William F. Buckley’s National Review. Then came Fox. And with Fox, as we shall see, came the changes that prefigured the victory of Donald Trump in 2016. The founder, CEO, and overall guiding light of the network was Roger Ailes. He was undeniably a Republican and a conservative, and yet even so, he was cut from different cloth than the Journal and NR. Born in 1940, Ailes grew up in   Warren, Ohio, 50 miles southeast of Cleveland. He got his start in local TV and quickly climbed the ladder, from prop boy to top dog. At age 25, he was executive producer of The Mike Douglas Show, which soon became the most widely syndicated daytime program in America. From there, Ailes jumped to Richard Nixon’s 1968 presidential campaign, and then went on to renown as a Republican political consultant, helping, among scores of clients, Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. (This author came to know, and work with, Ailes in the   I was also a Fox News contributor from 1996 to 2016.) Although Ailes was always a stickler that the news side of Fox should maintain its Fair and Balanced integrity, it’s undeniable that the opinion side of Fox —  mostly in prime time, but also sprinkled here and there throughout the weekly schedule —  leaned to the right. And yet at the same time, Fox was always, well, Ailesian. Just as he had tutored politicians never to talk down to the voters by dropping big words, so Ailes instructed his TV talent never to talk down to the audience. And so, unlike the Journal, Fox didn’t have much interest in libertarian economic theory opinionators were often in favor of lower taxes and limited government, but references to Adam Smith or Friedrich Hayek were few and far between. And unlike the scribes for National Review, Ailes had little interest in explications of conservative ideology or theology. What Ailes wanted was something different: He wanted strong personalities, crisp interviews, punchy language, and   points, made quickly. And his formula worked. When Fox debuted in 1996, both CNN and MSNBC were already on the air CNN’s Ted Turner predicted that his network would squash Fox “like a bug. ” Yet by 2002, Fox had overtaken CNN and could fairly claim its   tagline: “The Most Powerful Name In News. ” Everyone remembers that Ailes left Fox under    circumstances in July 2016, and yet even so, the momentum that he had built has continued to carry the channel forward. In January, Fox celebrated its 15th anniversary as the number one cable network. Of course, Ailes didn’t do all this by himself. The biggest star at Fox over the same two decades was Bill O’Reilly, who left the network, also under unpleasant circumstances, earlier this month. O’Reilly was a Fox Original he was on the air the very first day, October 7, 1996 (although the show was known then as The O’Reilly Report, and it didn’t yet air in prime time). Like Ailes, O’Reilly was a conservative, albeit of an even more populist persuasion. Indeed, from the first moment that BOR, as he was known internally, called someone a “pinhead,” the world was on notice that his show would be something different —  and something very popular. After all, O’Reilly was first and foremost a TV guy his roots were in local news and tabloid television —  also places that don’t reward complex locutions and polysyllabic words. And also, interestingly, for all his bluster, he never forgot, every night, to thank his audience for watching. It was that tight connection to his audience that made O’Reilly an enduring star. So here we can see how the personal becomes the political: Born in 1949, O’Reilly was a part of a powerful demographic group he was a   Irish Catholic from the   region —  specifically, New York’s Long Island. Once upon a time,   had been solidly Democratic. First, it was was Tammany Hall and all the other Democratic political machines in big cities across the country next, it was Al Smith (the first   Catholic presidential candidate) and FDR’s New Deal —  all the way. But then, in 1952, the great hero of World War Two, Republican Dwight Eisenhower, won the votes of many sons and daughters of Eire. Indeed, after a    detour in support of John Fitzgerald Kennedy in 1960, the Irish were inclined to support the presidential candidacies of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, even as they typically retained their Democratic identity in state and local elections. Yet then, in the early 90s, Democrat Bill Clinton won them back to his party. And so we return, once again, to the dawn of the Fox Era. Now let’s take a closer look at the country —  at least its presidential voting patterns —    and  . II. The Jacksonian Coalition vs. the Yankee Coalition,    was the last presidential election in which Fox did not play a role. In that year, Bill Clinton trounced George H. W. Bush in an electoral college landslide, 370 to 168. Let’s have a look at the electoral votes, laid out on a map: As we can readily see, Clinton not only won all but one of the Great Lakes States, but he also did well in the South he won four of the 11 states of the Old Confederacy. He also won both of the leading   states, Kentucky and West Virginia. To put these results another way, in 1992, the Democrats were fully competitive —  even dominant —  in the Heartland, especially in its northern reaches, up along Lake Michigan. Then came Ailes, O’Reilly, and the Fox News Channel. Theirs was a   that ordinary people across the country could understand and relate to. Thanks to FNC, it was no longer possible for the MSM and other scorners to stereotype the Republican Party as just the Chamber of Commerce plus the Moral Majority. Thanks to Fox, newer issues —    correctness, crime, jihad —   gained salience on the national stage. It was these newer issues, moving beyond the flat tax and Social Security privatization, or abortion and school prayer, that proved compelling to Northerners. Indeed, thanks to the commonality of Fox, a new kind of virtual community was formed. For the first time in decades, blue collars in Pittsburgh were on the same political wavelength as blue collars in Nashville. That is, Pennsylvanians and Tennesseans together could see honest but sympathetic journalism about cops, soldiers, and ordinary folks —  without the usual smugness, even hostility, of the MSM. Why, Fox fans could even meet each other on vacation in Branson, Missouri, the holiday nexus of the emerging Fox Nation. And of course, long before he was a presidential candidate, Donald Trump was a regular on Fox. Okay, so now to 2016. As we can gather from the electoral college map below, Republican Donald Trump reversed Bill Clinton’s strength in the Great Lakes whereas Bill Clinton had won six of those seven states in ‘92, Trump won five of seven against Hillary Clinton in ’16. In addition, Trump solidified much of the South he won the four states that Bush 41 had lost, although Virginia, increasingly dominated by the suburbs of Washington, DC, went the other way. And of course, Trump won Kentucky and West Virginia. Let’s have a look: So we can see: To win in 2016, Trump vastly strengthened the Republican grip on the heartland, while Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, even as they were losing, managed to retain their grip on the bulk of the Northeast and the West Coast. To consider the 2016 election results another way, we can examine the demographic underpinnings of the balloting. And these underpinnings can be stated simply: Trump united Southern white Protestants and Northern Catholics in the same political armada.   Thus we can see: Trump brought the O’Reilly constituency of Northern Catholics, which had wandered off to vote for Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, back into the Republican fold. As the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections had demonstrated, energized Republicans, nationwide, were mobilizing for big victories. And yet at the presidential level, those same GOP voters were waiting for a Republican candidate who was more Bill O’Reilly than Mitt Romney.   That is, a populist, not a plutocrat. And that O’  candidate, of course, was Trump. To be sure, Trump didn’t win all Northern Catholics. He was mostly blanked in New England, even as he won most of the Midwest, plus Pennsylvania. And of course, even in the states she won, Hillary Clinton didn’t win all the Catholics. In Massachusetts, for example, Trump won nearly 1. 1 million votes that total might provide a rough estimate of the number of Fox fans in the Bay State. Interestingly, this coalition of Northern Catholics and Southern white Protestants has a long and important political history. In fact, this particular   alliance was first forged by one of Trump’s heroes, Andrew Jackson, our seventh president, way back in 1828. Let’s have a look at the electoral college map for that year: Obviously much has changed in the last two centuries —  starting with the fact that, back then, the US consisted of just 22 states. Moreover, the political parties themselves have changed: Jackson won as the leader of the Democratic Party, while Adams ran as a National Republican, that being a forerunner to the Republican Party, which was not founded until 1854. Yet we can observe: The names of the candidates, and their party labels, may change, but the interests of peoples and regions remain far more steady. That is, Southerners tend to look at the world one way, and New Englanders (then and now, mostly Protestant, at least by background) tend to see it another way. And politically speaking, Catholics find themselves somewhere in between Southern and Northern Protestants. Andrew Jackson himself was a Southerner, but with the help of a wily Northern political strategist, Martin Van Buren, Old Hickory managed to pull together a   coalition, composed of Southern whites and Northern Catholics, that won the 1828 election in a landslide against John Quincy Adams. (In those days, of course, Southern blacks, being enslaved, couldn’t vote if they could have voted, they would undoubtedly have been for Adams, thus making the election far closer.) And then, four years later, in 1832, Jackson won a second landslide victory. Thus was established the Jacksonian Coalition. Now one might ask: What, exactly, did those two blocs, North and South, have in common? Answer: Not a whole lot, other than a shared antipathy to the policies and personalities of Yankee Protestants —  and that was enough. Not surprisingly, the hostility was mutual. In 1828, the Adams campaign labeled Jackson as the son of a prostitute, a bigamist, and a war criminal meanwhile, his Southern supporters were labeled as ignorant rustics, and his Northern supporters as “Papists. ” Today, two centuries later, not that much has changed. In 2016, Hillary Clinton repeatedly slammed Trump (he, of course, responded in kind) and then, most notoriously, she referred to his supporters as a “basket of deplorables. ” Needless to say, O’Reilly and Fox closely covered Clinton’s “deplorables” comment —  as did, of course, other, even newer, media outlets. Thus we can see that    media played a key role in knitting together a common Trumpian consciousness. The bottom line for 2016 is that the Deplorable Jacksonians, North and South, were back together. Yes, the party labels have flipped the Jacksonians, once Democrats, and are now Republicans, while the Yankees, once Republicans (or  ) are now Democrats. But the dynamic of regional rivalries is much the same. In the meantime, if we take another look at that 1828 map, we can see that the electoral wins for Jackson’s opponent that year, Adams, were almost entirely confined to New England, the hub of Yankee Protestantism. And of course, we know that in 2016, Hillary Clinton, too, won New England overwhelmingly. So again, we see a continuity: From Adams to Clinton, New England is typically on the other side of the Jacksonian Coalition. We can dub these   the Yankee Coalition. Of course, in 2016, Clinton did well with other demographic groups, too. Most notably, she won big among   and Hispanics. And that’s why Clinton carried states with large black populations, such as Illinois, as well as states with large Hispanic populations, such as California. Yet even though the contemporary Democratic coalition is far larger than just New England, we can observe that the Democrats’ intellectual heart is still with the Yankees, including such citadels as Harvard and Yale —  so let’s stick with Yankee Coalition. So there we have it: on one side, the Jacksonian Coalition of Southern white Protestants and Northern Catholics, and on the other, the Yankee Coalition, of New Englanders, people of color, and others who comprise all the little blue dots —  oftentimes, college towns —  across the country. Today, the Jacksonized Republican Party is vastly stronger than it was 25 years ago. And Ailes and O’Reilly deserve a lot of credit for that. So what will now happen to Fox, now that both of them are gone?   And what will happen to the Jacksonian Coalition,? III. What’s Next for Fox,    ’Reilly, It’s hard to predict the future the best thing to do is wait and see what transpires. But for those who can’t wait, some clues might be found in a canny April 20 article in The Hollywood Reporter by Michael Wolff. For many years now, Wolff has been a leading chronicler of the news business, including Fox News he even wrote a   and   book about Rupert Murdoch, the big boss of Fox’s parent company. Yet Murdoch, who hired Ailes two decades ago to start the news channel, is now 86. And so the torch is being passed to a new generation —  specifically, to Rupert’s younger son, James Murdoch. By all accounts, the younger Murdoch was the driving force behind the departure of both Ailes and O’Reilly and plans further changes, too. So when Wolff headlines his latest piece, “It’s James Murdoch’s Fox News Now,” attention must be paid. And we can be sure that the reunited Jacksonian Coalition, who bulk up the Fox audience, will be paying particularly close attention to the outlet that helped bring them together again. Will Fox still be a binding force for these folks in the future? Stay tuned. We don’t exactly how Fox will change in the years to come, but Wolff is clear about one thing: Change is coming. Big change."
Tennessee Couple Accused of Locking Girl with Autism in Wooden Cage to ‘Control the Child Better’ - Breitbart,"During a Monday welfare check, deputies in Jonesborough, TN discovered a girl with autism was locked in a cage that smelled like “urine and feces,” says a WJHL report.  Authorities were following up on a tip that a child was kept in a cage at a home owned by    Mickey Sparks and    Patricia Lewis. Upon arrival, they found the    girl locked in a wooden cage on a mattress in a bedroom. Court documents reveal that Sparks and Lewis kept the girl in the cage because “they were able to control the child better by locking her up,” and had done so for the last three or four years. Sparks told investigators that the Department of Children’s Services (DCS) was aware of the cage and its purpose, but they cannot find reports of DCS approving the cage. Sparks and Lewis were both arrested and charged with aggravated child abuse and neglect. They remain in jail on a $50, 000 bond. Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo"
Peggy Noonan: Trump ‘Could Break’ the GOP - Breitbart,"Tuesday on “CBS This Morning,” Wall Street Journal columnist and former speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan Peggy Noonan said the growing discontent between Republican presidential   Donald Trump and the   establishment wing could “break” the party.  Noonan said, “You know, the Republican consultant class and the Republican Party decided nine and six and even three months ago this whole thing is going to go away and we don’t  have to take it on, we don’t have to attack. When they finally realized, ‘Oh, my God, Trump and Trumpism are real, he could win,’ they suddenly thought they had to adopt his style and be tough and pugilistic. My sense is it doesn’t make anybody look better. I always thought Rubio and Cruz should be going at Trump having a conversation about policy rather than insulting each other. So I’m all for consultants beating themselves up but I’m not sure if they moved earlier, it would have worked. ” When asked if Trump could bring down the GOP, Noonan added, “He could break it. He could break it. Imagine what happens if he racks up a lot of delegates, they get to the convention, it looks like Trump has won, and the party machinery finagles it away from him. Trump supporters would blot the Republican Party. At the same time if Trump waltzes to the nomination, there is a major sliver, and maybe not just a sliver, at the top of the Party that will start a Republican Party in exile. Or you can quite imagine that happening. So we’re seeing something big. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN"
"Peter Schweizer: Trump Dissolves Foundation and Shows Leadership, Unlike Clintons Fighting ‘Tooth and Nail’ to Keep Their Cash Flow","Breitbart News Senior    Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute and author of the   Clinton Cash, discussed   Donald Trump’s decision to dissolve his Trump Foundation on Tuesday’s Breitbart News Daily. [He explained to SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam that the Trump Foundation was a “little bit different, in a number of respects” from the Clinton Foundation, which became a major issue for candidate Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign.  “The Trump Foundation, by and large, is what’s called a ‘ ’ foundation,” Schweizer said. “They would raise money  —   much of it came from the Trump family  —   and then they would take that money and give it to charitable organizations. It might be veterans groups. It would be community groups. There’s a whole long list of people they’ve given money to over the years. ” “Unlike the Clinton Foundation  —   which, first of all, is much larger and had an infrastructure where they had a lot of employees they ran their own programs  —   the Trump Foundation was really about giving grant money to other charitable organizations for the work they’re doing,” he noted. Schweizer said that based on Trump’s announcement, it looks like there will be an “immediate cessation” of the Trump Foundation’s work, which should address    concerns. “I’ve got to tell you, this is what leadership looks like,” he said. “Consider what Donald Trump has done voluntarily. This is not something that was imposed on him by somebody else. In the case of the Clintons, you know Barack Obama forced the Clintons into doing a lot of things they didn’t want to do, when she became secretary of state. ”  “Donald Trump has voluntarily now said, ‘I’m going to stop the Trump Foundation. It’s not going to exist. We’re no longer going to launch new business projects overseas, meaning major projects like hotels, et cetera, which is a huge concession.’ And he is going to be setting up a structure to, as best can be done given the legal constraints, remove himself from the   of the Trump organization,” Schweizer said.  “These are all being done voluntarily. I’m extremely encouraged,” he declared. “I was worried that these avenues for conflicts of interest were going to remain. But honestly, this is what leadership looks like. He says, ‘Look, I become president, this is my prime responsibility. I’m going to do what I can to remove barriers and remove things in my way that could create conflicts of interest and trouble.’ So it’s very, very encouraging, and it’s a nice change from the Clintons, where they would have to be dragged screaming and yelling to make even the most minor concession to a possible conflict of interest. ” Schweizer agreed there was “legitimate criticism of the Trump Foundation” and its spending priorities, after Kassam humorously observed that one of those priorities appeared to be purchasing $20, 000 portraits of Donald Trump. “We are going to continue to monitor the leadership of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself and the children, for conflicts of interest,” Schweizer pledged. “It’s one thing to say, ‘We’re not gonna do new major projects. We’re going to remove me from the   process.’ It’s another thing to make sure that it stays that way that’s actually how it operates. So I agree with you that the monitoring has to take place. ” “My concern, however, was going forward that Trump had won, Trump would feel his position was solidified enough that he would go about as he pleased, that the Trump Foundation would remain in operation,” he continued. “Remember that just last year, after he had announced and was doing pretty well in the polls, the Trump Foundation received a donation from Viktor Pinchuk, who’s a Ukrainian oligarch. This is somebody who gave a lot of money to the Clinton Foundation and got a lot of favors from the Clintons in return, so there was some very real concern that it was going to be business as usual. ”  “The news that they are going to shut these things down is very encouraging to me,” Schweizer said. “It indicates that, first of all, he recognizes these things are a problem. Second of all, that he recognizes that they are a political vulnerability, that if you are going to, as one of your banners carrying forward is ‘we’re going to drain the swamp of Washington, D. C.,’ it’s a political vulnerability if you yourself are seen as a creature of that swamp. ”  “Look, I’m not saying that everything is done, everything is taken care of, everything is the place that it should be,” he added. “But I’m very encouraged that these steps are being taken voluntarily to prevent these conflicts of interest, at least on the face of appearance, of causing a problem. I think that is grounds for celebration. If you contrast that with the Clintons, when Hillary became secretary of state  —   Barack Obama put very few restrictions on them, but the ones that he did, the Clintons fought tooth and nail, disclosing who the donors were. So this is a nice contrast to what I think we would have had with Bill and Hillary Clinton, which would have been complete business as usual. ” Kassam asked about journalist complaints that Trump has not given a press conference recently, noting that many of these same journalists were perfectly comfortable with Hillary Clinton avoiding press conferences for hundreds of days during the presidential campaign. “I don’t think Donald Trump is obligated to do a press interview right now,” Schweizer contended. “He’s not the President of the United States. He’s a private citizen who will very soon be the most powerful figure in the world, but no, he’s not under any obligation. ” “I do think, obviously, when you become President of the United States that you need to subject yourself to questioning. The process, of course, is different in the U. K. where you have Question Time, opposition political figures ask you questions. In the United States, I think you need to give the media the opportunity to do that,” he added. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.

"From Bikinis to Burkinis, Regulating What Women Wear - The New York Times","PARIS  —   The policeman in the photo is nattily attired and appears to have a slight smirk as he writes out a ticket for the woman standing before him awkwardly in her offending swimwear perhaps he enjoys making her feel uncomfortable. No, she is not wearing a burkini. The photo dates from 1957. The woman is wearing a bikini on the beach at Rimini on Italy’s Adriatic coast. At the time, Italy prohibited the revealing bathing suit it was too immodest to be worn in public. In the midst of France’s fight over banning the burkini, the bikini is celebrating its 70th anniversary, and photographs chronicling its debut and early history in the 1940s, ’50s and ’60s are on display in one of Paris’s chic galleries, prompting parallels to the uproar over the burkini today. What is it about women’s swimwear and more generally women’s attire that over and over in history has attracted controversy and impelled societies to legislate or regulate women’s choices? Historians, sociologists and anthropologists have argued about it for decades, but the seemingly simplistic statement that women’s bodies are a battleground has some truth to it. Formally or informally, men (primarily) have been making rules about women’s attire for a very long time. “Can’t we decide what we want to wear in 2016?” wondered Sarah Fekih, 23, from Lyon, France, in a comment she wrote to The New York Times. “If one wishes to dress skimpily or to be almost nude or to be covered from head to toe, isn’t that a personal choice that can not be dictated by law?” Of course, the burkini debate is not only about feminism. It is foremost a debate about the visibility and presence of Islam in France, and it comes in the context of the most recent act of terror to traumatize the country, this one in Nice, on the Mediterranean coast. On July 14, a man drove a cargo truck into crowds of people there, killing 86 and wounding 300. The Islamic State later called him one of its “soldiers. ” Less than a month later, the first of at least 30 bans on “inappropriate” clothing on beaches  —   meant to target Muslim attire  —   was enacted in Cannes, about 20 miles from Nice. Although France’s highest administrative court, the Council of State, struck down one town’s burkini ban on Friday  —   and clearly would do the same for other towns if lawsuits were brought  —   the fight is far from over. The Parliament could enact a ban, and some of France’s 2017 presidential candidates on the right and far right have pledged to enact measures that run from banning the Muslim veil in universities and businesses to banning almost all religious attire in public. As the debate continues, much that is important will be said about France and racism and Islam, but it is worth pondering that it is women’s clothes that are at issue. Throughout history, a combination of legislation, local regulation and social pressure has influenced the way women have dressed  —   corsets and décolleté, hoop skirts and bustles, the controversial advent of pants. France is now a society demanding that women undress, but in many ways this debate is part of the same narrative. In the case of both the bikini and the burkini, “people in positions of power say, ‘We’re putting these rules in place for the woman’s good,’” said Deirdre Clemente, a history professor at the University of Nevada who has studied dress codes for women. “The implication is that women are unable to regulate their appearance themselves. ” As recently as the 1980s, a number of large American corporations had extensive dress codes for women. “There would be four pages on what a woman could wear to work, and four sentences for men,” Professor Clemente said. When it came to the bikini, not only was it forbidden in some countries, with women forced to pay fines and leave many beaches if they wore one. It was also seen as subversive and a sign of moral weakness. Italy, Spain and some beaches on the Atlantic coast of France prohibited wearing the swimsuit in the first few years after it went on the market, said Ghislaine Rayer, a   of “Bikini: La Légende,” a history of the  . That prohibition resonates in today’s burkini debate, said Hanane Karimi, a graduate student of sociology at the University of Strasbourg. She is the leader of a feminist Muslim collective that wants mosques in France to make more space for women at prayers and to be more respectful of their involvement in religious affairs. “In some countries that had strong religiosity, like Italy, controlling women’s bodies was a part of the country’s religious morality today in France there is a civil religion of secularity,” she said. “And it has the exact same logic in respect to the control of women’s bodies: Those women who adhere to that secular morality are undressed on the beaches nothing is hidden. ” Today the French seem to believe as strongly that such undress is mandatory as Italy, under the Vatican’s influence, felt it was necessary to hide women’s bodies, she added. It was not always that way. When the designer of the first bikini, Louis Réard, coined the name (a play on the tiny atoll of Bikini, where the United States had just tested the atomic bomb) and showed his new swimsuit at the Molitor Pool in Paris on July 5, 1946, he could not find models willing to wear it. So he hired   from the Paris Casino. “It was   it was ahead of its time,” said Ms. Rayer, the   of the book on the bikini’s history. “In that epoch, we were still puritan. ” Although the bikini quickly became popular in movies, it took more than 15 years, and longer in many places, to enter the fashion mainstream. France embraced it ahead of several other countries and eventually even allowed women to sunbathe or swim topless. Joan Wallach Scott, a social scientist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, sees France’s approbation of revealing swimwear, as well as the current burkini bans, as products of ideas going back to the French Revolution of 1789. “What you have in French republicanism is a conflict between a commitment to equality and the notion that sexual difference is a natural difference which explains why there can’t be equality between women and men,” she said. The French believe it is necessary to show the difference between men and women physically even while proclaiming their equality, Ms. Scott said. The painter Eugène Delacroix depicted “Liberty” as a   woman leading the righteous French. Sculptures and reliefs of a   or    Marianne, a French symbol of the revolution and liberty, can still be found on government documents, buildings and postal stamps. The very depiction of women reflects how the sexes differ. “Then on the other side you have Muslim society saying that sex and sexual difference is a problem, and women, whether submitting or not, are covered. So in a sense they are exposing the contradiction in French society, and that’s intolerable,” Ms. Scott said. “It becomes a commentary on the French need to have women uncovered. ” Indeed, the deputy mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, who is a political power broker on the Côte d’Azur, has repeatedly referred to the covering of women on the beach  —   whether in a burkini or a large   pants and hijab  —   as a “provocation,” suggesting a challenge to the French order. Such language mystifies one of the burkini’s designers, who sells her pieces in France. Vanessa Lourenço, the designer, said she had started creating them to give Muslim women a chance to participate in the same activities as the rest of the community. She loves to swim herself, she said, so seeing religious Muslims or other people not go swimming “struck me as unacceptable. ” Ms. Lourenço, whose internet business sells swimwear in 120 countries, is not Muslim, and people often ask her why she designs for Muslim women. “My answer is simple: At the end of the day women are women, whether Muslim or not, and we all want to be comfortable, look beautiful and feel feminine,” she said. “Most of our clients message us saying it is the first time that they were confident enough to be at a public beach enjoying themselves with their family. ”"
Geert Wilders For Breitbart: ’We Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet’,"Dutch Party For Freedom (PVV) leader and prominent   campaigner Geert Wilders has spoken exclusively to Breitbart London in the aftermath of this morning’s major terror attack and has lamented it is just the beginning of growing Islamist violence. [Mr. Wilders said: “I fear that we ain’t seen nothing yet. According to Europol 3, 000 to 5, 000 European jihadists, who went to Syria to fight in the ranks of IS and similar terrorist groups, have meanwhile returned to Western Europe. Some of them hid among the hundreds of thousands of Islamic asylum seekers that entered Europe from Asia and Africa.  “Two of last November’s terrorist in Paris had fought in Syria. So had the terrorist who, last August, attempted to attack the high speed train between Amsterdam and Paris. So had the two terrorists who, in January 2015, massacred the editorial staff of Charlie Hebdo. So had the terrorist who, in May 2014, shot four people at the Jewish Museum in Brussels”. Belgian police have recently said at least 90 returned fighters from the Islamic State are living at liberty in Brussels, many of them in the infamous Molenbeek neighbourhood. European Commission insider Hermann Kelly told Breitbart Radio this morning he was concerned so many lived just miles from the political capital of the European Union. Mr. Kelly said: “This is amazing to me that these people can kill people abroad, come here, and then walk free in the centre of Brussels”. On this, Mr. Wilders remarked: “Returned Syria fighters are a huge threat. They are dangerous predators roaming our streets. It is absolutely unbelievable that our governments allow them to return. And it is incredible that, once returned, they are not imprisoned. “In the Netherlands, we have dozens of these returned jihadists. Our government allows most of them to freely walk our streets and refuses to lock them up. I demand that they be detained at once. Every government in the West, which refuses to do so, is a moral accessory if one of these monsters commits an atrocity. “The government must also close our national borders. The European Union’s Schengen zone, where no border controls are allowed, is a catastrophe. The Belgian Moroccan Salah Abdeslam, the mastermind of last November’s bloodbath in Paris, travelled freely from Belgium to the Netherlands on multiple occasions last year. “This is intolerable. Open borders are a huge safety risk. Our citizens are in mortal danger if we do not restore control over our own national borders”. Speaking earlier today Mr. Wilders lamented that commuters were killed in “cold blood” and said “The cause of all this bloodshed is Islam. We need to   the West. That is the only way to safeguard our lives and protect our freedom”.  "
"Why this man is running 3,000 miles across America","Los Angeles (CNN) Turning 50 is one of those   moments. Some hate it. Some embrace it. Others just run away. And the latter is what criminal defense attorney Darren Kavinoky is doing. The host of Investigation Discovery’s ”Deadly Sins” is running more than 3, 000 miles from Los Angeles to New York City to bring awareness to   causes, he told CNN. Starting on Thursday, Kavinoky and his training partner, Kyle Gaffney, will run anywhere from 40 to 50 miles a day    following a pattern of three days on, one day off over the next three months until they reach the steps of New York City Hall.  But, why 3, 000+ miles? As the big   approached last year, wellness kiosk company higi approached Kavinoky with a proposition. The company would brand him the ”New Face of 50,” and he’d get to live out a childhood fantasy. All he’d have to do is run from Los Angeles to New York    a distance of 2, 451 miles as the bird flies, but Kavinoky’s course runs more than 3, 000 miles. ”For me, this was a dream when I was an overweight    kid in Richmond, Virginia,” Kavinoky said. ”I was shuffling around my apartment complex daydreaming of running across the country and being sponsored by Nike. They’d just released their iconic waffle shoe, and now, 40 years later, it’s happening and Nike is indirectly sponsoring the run through Road Runner.” Kavinoky hopes his run will inspire others to put down the doughnuts, put on a pair of athletic shoes and share their progress on Twitter at #whatsmywin. Along the way, Kavinoky will meet with mayors, governors and other local leaders in different states. He’ll provide them with health statistics specific to their communities and help them devise a plan to get people moving and get healthy. During a stop in Dallas, Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith and Garth Brooks will join the health campaign, but not for the long run.  What will make the trek with him is his name and picture on the motor home that will tail him on the road. ”This is a big undertaking,” Kavinoky says. ”I’ve always said, ’You go through life as an example or a warning. ’” Kavinoky will use the short breaks for the long trek to film the sixth season of ”Deadly Sins.” The preparation, Kavinoky has been working out four times a day to prepare. He’s suffered shin splints and dealt with back issues. The course is sure to deal him more pain. Being away from family will be equally as challenging. ”The thing that’s weighed heaviest on my mind is leaving my wife and daughter,” Kavinoky says. ”But kids pay more attention to what we do than what we say. I want to show my daughter that ordinary people are capable of doing truly extraordinary things.” ’A win is a very personal thing’ Kavinoky understands that developing a healthy lifestyle is no easy feat    but it’s possible.  He evolved from a ”chubby kid” to a young man who struggled with drugs and alcohol to committing to extreme workout regimens and triathlons.  ”A win is a very personal thing,” Kavinoky explains. ”For me, it may be running across America. For someone else, it may be walking down their driveway and back. It doesn’t matter. The idea isn’t that anyone needs to be better than someone else. It’s just being better today than they were yesterday.”"
The Fruits of Socialism: Venezuela in 20 Photos - Breitbart,"As Venezuela enters year eighteen of the Bolivarian Socialist Revolution, the international community is finally paying attention, as Venezuelans struggle to find food, medicine, and an outlet for their frustration that will not trigger rampant state violence. [There is no short version of the story of how South America’s wealthiest nation, which boasts the world’s largest known oil reserves, became a nation where 15 percent of people need to scavenge through garbage to eat while the nation’s dictator dances on state television. Venezuela’s decline is the inevitable endgame of socialism, told by the deterioration of its streets, the abuse of its opposition politicians, and the use of the military to maim and kill Venezuelan children as young as 14.  Below, 20 images show the true toll of socialism in Venezuela. December 2011: While the death of Hugo Chávez allowed for socialist leaders to rapidly develop the cult of personality around him as a saint and martyr of socialism, the North   cult worship of Chávez began during his lifetime. In 2011, chavista government officials put together a Christian “nativity scene” depicting Chávez as the baby Jesus figure, surrounded by founding fathers such as Simón Bolívar. (L’encre Noir)   May 2011: As violent drug and gang activity flourished under Chávez, Venezuelans grew to fear murder at the hands of thugs so much that they prayed to dead thugs to protect them, creating idols known as “santos malandros” —  ”holy thugs“ —  and offering them small sacrifices in exchange for safety on urban streets. (AP Photo) May 20, 2017: Protesters flood the streets of San Cristóbal, the capital of westernmost Táchira state, where resistance to socialism has been often the most aggressive. (Luis    Images) May 20, 2017: Caracas is also no stranger to giant peaceful opposition mobilizations, with the below protest occurring on the same day as the Táchira march.

Families crossed to buy detergent, paper towels, food, and other needs. (George  ) August 2015: To prevent Venezuelans from fleeing, and in protest of objections to human rights violations in the country from Colombia, Maduro shut the border down and violently deported all Colombian citizens on the border. Homes where Colombian citizens used to live were marked “D” for “demolition,” to erase any trace of Colombians there. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos denounced the move as using “Nazi ghetto tactics” against a friendly neighboring country. (Foto:Blu Radio) February 2014: Long before Táchira residents found themselves scrambling into Colombia for basic foods, however, they began demanding free exercise of political rights. Táchira was the first state to take down a likeness of dictator Hugo Chávez, nearly a year after the late dictator died. (Twitter) WARNING: GRAPHIC February 15, 2015: San Cristóbal residents gather around the lifeless body of Kluivert Roa, 14, shot and killed by Venezuelan soldiers while walking home from school. Witnesses say Roa saw a protest while walking home and shouted “stop the repression!” before soldiers shot him in the head. (George Castellanos   via Clarín) WARNING: GRAPHIC May 20, 2017: Due to the presence of armed soldiers and armed chavista gangs known as colectivos, protesters have grown extremely concerned that infiltrated government agents have joined the protests. During this protest, young protesters surrounded Orlando Figuera, accused of being a thief and chavista, and burned him alive. (AFP) April 1, 2014: While the government has reserved its most intense violence for the average protester, it has not relented on attacking government members of the opposition, either. Below, lawmaker Maria Corina Machado (center) —  illegally ousted from the National Assembly —  flees as soldiers attack her with tear gas during a peaceful protest. (Twitter) April 2017: Maduro has rounded up and arrested many opposition leaders. The most prominent among them is the head of the Popular Will party, Leopoldo López, who was banned from seeing family for a month this year.

(Ronaldo   Images) January 11, 2010: The violence that Bolivarian Socialism has brought to Venezuela only tells half the story. The other half is one of extreme poverty, where the value of the currency, the bolívar, has been in freefall for years. Even those with money struggle to find a store that is properly stocked. During the Chávez era, finding junk food and unhealthy soda in supermarkets was still possible, but not without encountering   soldiers posted to prevent visitors from photographing the shortages or attempting to buy more than “necessary. ” During the Maduro era, the government implemented a strict ration card system. (Juan    Images) May 2016: The below image is not an uncommon find in Venezuelan supermarkets. (Juan  ) June 2016: The cities of Caracas are lined with garbage, and up to 15 percent of the population need to dig through garbage to eat. The crisis is particularly affecting children, who are growing and have specific nutrition requirements impossible to meet with the average Venezuelan diet. (Sumarium. com) March 2017: While human families struggle to feed themselves, Venezuela’s zoos have been almost completely unable to fulfill the needs of their animals. In March, rare images inside a Venezuelan zoo (the Venezuelan military severely limits the public’s photographing rights) surfaced showing Ruperta, a    African elephant, showing clear signs of malnutrition. The Venezuelan government denied that the elephant was suffering. (Twitter) September 2016: Hospitals are faring little better than Venezuela’s supermarkets. Shortages of drugs and medical supplies have plagued the country for years, sending infant and maternal mortality rates skyrocketing. Below, a hospital uses cardboard boxes as cribs for their newborns. ( ) May 8, 2017: The staggering shortages have triggered waves of protests, like the one above in Táchira and daily protests in Caracas since March.

In November, the pile of bolivares, shown below, was worth $100. The value has decreased significantly since. (Ben   News) December 16, 2016: Maduro attempted to improve the ease of use of the bolívar by outlawing the   note and replacing it with larger denominations. The larger denominations were not printed in time, so the value of Venezuela’s   notes went to zero overnight. Venezuelans began burning the bills or ceremonially tossing them in trash cans.

Can U.S. confront racial divide with ’Amazing Grace’?," (CNN) It was September 15, 1963, a normal Sunday morning at 16th Street Baptist in Birmingham, Alabama. Four young girls    Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson, Cynthia Wesley and Denise McNair    were in the basement assembly room changing into their choir robes. The sermon for the day was titled ”A Love That Forgives.”  Then an explosion ripped through the church, injuring 22 and killing the four little choir girls, the youngest of whom, Denise McNair, was just 11 years old. Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson, Cynthia Wesley and Denise McNair: Their names have been etched in my memory since childhood. I learned them with the books of the Bible. The way a student in Catholic school can recite the saints and Christian martyrs, I memorized their names: the martyrs of civil rights. Jimmie Lee Jackson, shot by a state trooper, died February 26, 1965, in Marion, Alabama Medgar Evers was killed June 12, 1963, in Jackson, Mississippi Emmett Till was killed August 28, 1955, in Money, Mississippi Samuel Hammond, Henry Smith and Delano Middleton died February 8, 1968, in Orangeburg, South Carolina Martin Luther King Jr. was killed April 4, 1968, in Memphis the list goes on and on.  Now we add nine names. You see, the inescapable truth is that the Rev. Sharonda   Cynthia Hurd, Susie Jackson, Ethel Lee Lance, the Rev. Depayne   Tywanza Sanders, the Rev. Daniel L. Simmons Sr. Myra Thompson and the Honorable Sen. Clementa C. Pinckney were gunned down not for politics, revenge or even money. They weren’t caught in a crossfire, in the wrong place in the wrong time. They were targeted for their race. Just like Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson, Cynthia Wesley and Denise McNair, they were killed because they were black. It’s as undeniable as the killer’s own words: ”You rape our women, and you’re taking over our country.”  It’s something out of a bad movie.  It forces us to confront the inescapable reality of racial division facing our nation.  Staring at that gaping wound, we dare not turn away, because this conversation, as uncomfortable as it makes us, is long overdue. Right now in America, homicide is the leading cause of death for black males between 15 to 34 while, in South Carolina, blacks make up just over a quarter of the total population but roughly 65% of the prison population.  Infant mortality rates are roughly twice as high for black children in South Carolina as they are for whites, and a child has better odds being born in Sri Lanka, Lebanon, Botswana or Cuba than being born black in my state. Nearly every statistic you can look at    from health care to education to annual income and unemployment    the disparities between black and white are striking.  We dare not look away from these things, because if we do, then nothing will ever change. It is yet to be seen what the   impact of the Mother Emanuel massacre will be for our state and nation. It’s yet to be seen whether the congregants’ martyrdom will be something more than a footnote to history, more names on the wall. But for the first time in a long time, we are looking at the issue   and as a people    black and white, young and old, rich and poor, men and women    together. The problem is right there in front of us. Now, what are we going to do about it? Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook. .  Read CNNOpinion’s Flipboard magazine. "
White House to Be Lit in Blue in Honor of Autism Awareness - Breitbart,"The White House will light up in the color blue Sunday evening in honor of World Autism Awareness Day. [“I invite all Americans to Light it Up Blue, which Melania and I will do at the White House,” President Trump said in an announcement Friday, according to The Hill.  “I call upon all Americans to learn more about the signs of autism to improve early diagnosis, understand the challenges faced by those with autism spectrum disorders, and to do what they can to support individuals with autism spectrum disorders and their families,” he added. Press Secretary Sean Spicer said President Trump promised “the late wife of his friend Bob Wright that he would illuminate the White House in blue if he won the election,” according to the Associated Press. Bob Wright and his wife Suzanne, who passed away in 2016, founded the Autism Speaks advocacy group in 2005, which has a blue logo. “Spicer says it’s in honor of the Wrights that the White House on Sunday will help draw attention to a ‘great cause,’” AP reports. “On World Autism Awareness Day, we highlight the importance of addressing the causes and improving the treatments for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs),” Trump said."
Bernie Sanders Campaign Mocks Hillary Clinton’s High-Dollar Clooney Fundraiser - Breitbart,"Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign mocked rival Hillary Clinton’s expensive planned fundraisers with George Clooney in California next month, telling supporters in an email that the exorbitant ticket prices for the events prove that his campaign is the one that represents “working Americans. ”  George and Amal Clooney are set to host Clinton for a pair of    fundraisers in San Francisco and Los Angeles in April. Two seats at the head table with Mr. and Mrs. Clooney and Clinton at the April 15 San Francisco event will set supporters back a staggering $353, 400, far more than most regular Clinton fundraising events. “In the movie Oceans 11, a gang of lovable thieves successfully heist $150 million from a vault in the basement of the Bellagio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas,” Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver wrote in an email to supporters on Friday, according to The Hill. “Fueled primarily from   donations, Hillary Clinton has raised more than that in this campaign, and is now enlisting the support of George Clooney (Danny Ocean) to pad that total at a dinner event that will cost people up to $353, 400 to attend. ” Weaver reportedly called the ticket price “an obscene amount of money,” and added that it would take a minimum   working 365 days a year nearly five years to pay that sum. “Here is the truth: while tens of millions of Americans are struggling to put dinner on the table, the wealthiest people in this country have never had it so good,” Weaver concluded in the email. “And the great question of this campaign is will we restore a vibrant democracy in this country, or will we slide into an oligarchy in which the economic and political life is controlled by a handful of billionaires?” The night following the San Francisco event, the Clooneys will host Clinton at their Studio City home for a $33, 400   fundraiser. (Clinton supporters who don’t have the cash to spare can enter to win admission to the event by texting CLOONEY to 47246). DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeff Katzenberg, director Steven Spielberg and his wife Kate Capshaw will   the April 16 fundraiser at the Clooney residence, along with Clinton’s top Hollywood donor, billionaire entertainment mogul Haim Saban and his wife Cheryl."
’I had no idea I was witnessing the work of a saint’ ," (CNN) I had a pretty ordinary childhood in the Indian city of Kolkata. I was part of a happy, healthy, close knit family. My sisters and I went to school, played some sport, hung out with our friends.  When we could, we tagged along with our mother when she did volunteer work. It had the reassuring rhythm of a routine life. Back then, I had no idea I was witnessing history, and the work of a saint, taking place. My mother was, and still is, part of a group called the   of the Missionaries of Charity.  It’s a community of local volunteers    largely women, of varying age and from different religions    who assisted Mother Teresa, and now her group of nuns, in any way they could. My mother would go to Nirmala Shishu Bhavan, Mother Teresa’s shelter for abandoned babies and children, to tutor children who were being adopted by European families.  It would be helpful, the nuns felt, for them to know a little English before they started a new life abroad. Often, I’d go along with my mom and practice conversational English with them. Each time, I was struck by a board outside the dormitory that listed the number of children inside.  There were always many more girls than boys    a stark reflection of India’s preference for boys over girls. As one of three daughters myself, it used to    and still does    fill me with sadness and disgust.  Yet, I remember feeling relieved at the same time. At least the babies who made it to Mother Teresa’s homes were being cared for and stood a chance.  Read the service where the Pope will declare Mother Teresa a saint  I saw firsthand how well they were cared for    by the volunteers, the nuns and Mother Teresa herself. Little, but a powerhouse, It was common for me to run into Mother Teresa at Shishu Bhavan. She was often just there    cradling a sick baby, feeding a child, patiently engaging a toddler tugging at her sari. She was little, but a powerhouse of energy, darting from one end of the house to another with quick steps. I remember her deeply wrinkled face and sparkly eyes with which she made intense eye contact when she spoke to you. She had a tremendous presence. As clichéd as it sounds, when she was in the room, it had a different energy. Loreto House was my own school and run by the same order Mother Teresa was part of before she founded her Missionaries of Charity. There, she was often the subject of many conversations, art, essay and poetry competitions. I once wrote a poem on her, which my mother handed to her. The next time I saw Mother Teresa, she beckoned to me. When a legendary photographer met an iconic missionary  ”Come here, come here,” she smiled and said, ”I want to show you something.” She led me to a statue of Mary at Shishu Bhavan and there above it, was my poem    framed. By that, I mean, a sheet of paper with the unsure handwriting of a school student, inserted into a clear plastic packet, taped to a wall. Then she did what she would always do, clasp my hands tightly in hers and say, ”God bless you my child, God bless you”. When people hear I am from Kolkata, which used to be known as Calcutta, the usual follow up is a knowing nod and, ”Oh, Mother Teresa.”  Yes, it’s a city that’s become synonymous with Mother Teresa and as a result, instantly conjures up images of poverty, desperation, despair. It’s known for its slums and squalor. That hurts. But, it’s also going to be known as the city that produced a saint. As a Calcuttan, I’m proud of that. That’s my city. That’s home."
Jimmy Kimmel to Host 2017 Academy Awards - Breitbart,"Jimmy Kimmel has been tapped to host the 2017 Academy Awards, according to the Hollywood Reporter. [The outlet reported Monday that the Jimmy Kimmel Live! host will take the reins for the 89th annual Oscars, set to be broadcast February 26 on ABC.  Oscars producers Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd were expected to announce the selection of Kimmel with an official announcement. It will be Kimmel’s first time hosting the Oscars, long considered to be the biggest awards show in the business as well as Hollywood’s most important night. The   funnyman previously hosted the Emmy Awards twice, in 2012 and this past year, and has also hosted both the ESPYs and the American Music Awards. Kimmel earned decent reviews for his Emmys performance this year, but it wasn’t enough to save the TV awards ceremony from its worst viewership showing ever. As the Hollywood Reporter notes, the Oscars are a significantly   event last year’s broadcast, hosted by Chris Rock, drew 34. 3 million viewers, itself an   viewership low.

Vitamins Gone Gummy - The New York Times,"For nearly 100 years, candy companies have made gummy treats  —   those chewy,     bears, worms and fish that kids love to eat. But now the gummy bear has grown up. A number of supposedly “  ” gummies for adults have been introduced in the vitamin and supplement market. Among the many choices: Vitafusion sells Power C Gummy Vitamins for Adults, which promise “great tasting gummies with natural orange flavor. ” Caltrate Gummy Bites pack calcium and vitamin D in black cherry, orange or strawberry gummy candies. “They taste good  —   like candy,” said Susan Drexler, 53, a Manhattan real estate agent and gummy vitamin lover. “I take them much more consistently. ” Ms. Drexler got into gummies through her    daughter, Alana. Ms. Drexler has a “bear of a time swallowing large pills or capsules,” she said. A few years ago, she tried some of her daughter’s gummy vitamins, and from then on she was hooked. “Her kid gummies were my ‘gateway drug,’” said Ms. Drexler. “Now I buy the adult ones, and we share those. ” Millions of people are hooked on gummies as a health supplement. Gummy multivitamins accounted for 7. 5 percent of the $6 billion multivitamin market in the United States in 2016, according to estimates from the Nutrition Business Journal and projections from IBISWorld, a research company. And gummy products over all now account for $1 billion of the $41 billion supplement market in the United States, a more than 25 percent jump in sales since 2015, according to IBISWorld. “We’ve seen a really nice increase in demand for gummy supplements over the past three to four years,” Doug Jones, the chief merchandise officer at Vitamin Shoppe, which carries a broad assortment of gummy vitamins and supplements, said in an email. Gummy vitamins and supplements originally targeted children, and were offered as a fun way to get kids to take their vitamins. But in 2012, Perrigo, a supplement maker with headquarters in Ireland, began marketing gummy products to adults. Last year, the company announced that it was partnering with Ferrara Candy Company, maker of Trolli Sour Brite Crawlers, to develop multivitamins for adults over 30. One reason gummy vitamins are so popular with adults these days is “pill fatigue. ” A 2005 AARP study found that, on average, adults 45 and older said they take four prescription medications daily. But some people say that switching to a gummy version of a vitamin or supplement makes them feel as if they aren’t taking so many pills. Gummies also appeal to people who, like Ms. Drexler, have difficulty swallowing pills. The flavorings in gummy candy can also hide the taste. “Vitamins can be nasty,” said Paul Breslin, a professor of nutritional sciences at Rutgers University, and a researcher at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. “Some taste bad. Some can be astringent. A lot of others have foul odors. Gummies are a pleasant way to mask the aversiveness. ” But beyond the sweet flavor, humans enjoy chewing, said Mr. Breslin. “Let’s face it, these are dynamic experiences of moving your mouth,” he said. “People love to chew it’s in our genes. We buy chewing gum. ” But the pleasures of chewing come at a cost. Consumers can take one Nature Made Vitamin C 1, 000 milligram pill costing about 10 cents (a   bottle costs about $30). To get the same amount of vitamin C from a Nature Made gummy vitamin, consumers would need to take eight gummies, at a cost of about 70 cents (a bottle of 80 125 milligram gummies costs $7) And gummy vitamins typically contain one to two grams of sugar each  —   a 1, 000 milligram dose of Nature Made Gummy Vitamin C contains 8 grams of sugar. Some companies have begun offering   versions of gummy vitamins for consumers who prefer a sugar substitute. One issue with the sweet taste of gummy vitamins and supplements is that people might eat too many. “The only concern I might have is if people are tempted to eat these like candy and end up overdosing on vitamins,” especially “those that are fat soluble,” which can cause a range of problems if ingested over long periods, said Kim Larson, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Hallie Rich, the president of Alternavites, steered clear of gummies when coming up with her own line of vitamins. “With the fillers and additives there’s only so much space for active nutrients,” she said. “You’re missing ingredients or they aren’t there in enough quality to make a difference. They are a glorified candy. ” Susan Pica agrees. Ms. Pica, 40, the vice president of national sales for an executive transportation company, in Stamford, Conn. saw a gummy vitamin C display at CVS, along with a coupon to “buy one get one free. ” She had fond memories of the Flintstones chewables she took as a child, so she thought she’d try them. “I felt like I was eating Sour Patch Kids,” she said. “’How can these be good for you? My teeth actually hurt from eating them. ” After seeing sugar sprinkled on the vitamins and settled at the bottom of the bottle, she checked the ingredients on the label. The bottle listed sugar, corn syrup and sodium citrate among the ingredients. “I decided to use the gummy vitamins as a treat, like candy,” she said. “Because that’s what they are  —   candy. ”"

And she says that’s true tonight before saying this election will be over soon. 9:27: Clinton says Trump looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a “4” or perhaps a “5. ” Clinton says she’s now known for her sense of humor and that’s why it took a village to write her jokes. Clinton jokes she’s the life of every party she has attended and she’s been to three. She says when the party gets out of hand, it’s imperative to have a responsible chaperone to get everyone home safely, and that’s why she picked Tim Kaine. Clinton says it’s smart there’s no Teleprompter because you saw Trump dismantle his. She jokes it’s harder when you’re translating from the original Russian. 9:25: Clinton jokes about the dinner bringing together bitter foes and asks how de Blasio and Cuomo were able to get together. She makes a “basket of adorables” joke. Clinton says Trump should feel free to shout “wrong” whenever she is talking. Clinton says it’s amazing she is speaking after Donald because she didn’t think he would be okay with a “peaceful transition of power. ” She says after listening to his speech, she will enjoy listening to Pence deny he ever gave it. 9:21: After Trump gets booed, Clinton now goes to the podium. She says this is such a special event that she took a break from her “rigorous nap schedule” to be here. She says it’s a treat because usually she charges a lot for speeches like this. Clinton talks about the “fiery populist” Al Smith and says he would be very proud of how much money they’ve raised for needy children. She says if he saw this room full of plutocrats celebrating his legacy, he would be very confused. Clinton also jokes that she may not be eligible for Sainthood but getting through three debates with Trump has to count for a miracle. 9:15: Trump says Clinton isn’t laughing much tonight because she knows all of the jokes, which were given in advance to her by Donna Brazile. Trump also swipes Clinton for protecting to like Catholics and says Clinton knows “it takes a village” and has taken a number of them in Haiti. Trump says he wants to say something nice about Clinton. He says Clinton has been in Washington a long time and knows a lot about how government works. He says according to her sworn testimony, Clinton has forgotten more about government than most of us even know. 9:12: Trump also takes a dig at the mainstream press. He also says that the media is so biased because everyone loves Michelle Obama’s speech but when Melania delivers the same speech, everyone gets on her case. Trump says Hillary is so corrupt that she got kicked off the Watergate Commission. “How corrupt do you have to be to kicked off the Watergate Commission?” he says. Trump says Clinton has been in politics since the 70s and her pitch is the economy is busted and the government is corrupt. Trump says he wasn’t sure Hillary was going to be here tonight because “you didn’t send her invitations by email. ”   There’s also this sense that Trump is surprised at the words he’s reciting  …    asif he’s never seen the before. (”true! true! ”)  —   Jeff Greenfield (@greenfield64) October 21, 2016,  9:10: Trump said he called Hillary a “nasty woman” last night and after Clinton rattled on and on and on, he doesn’t think badly of Rosie O’Donnell anymore.

He says Hillary bumped into him and said, “pardon me. ” Trump says he told her he would talk about it after he gets into office. Trump says Hillary said he would want Trump to be her Ambassador to Iraq or Afghanistan. 9:07: Trump makes a joke about how he was a “carpenter working for his father. ” He says what’s great about the Al Smith Dinner is that even in the rough and tumble world of politics, the candidates are able to have some lighthearted moments. 9:05: Trump gives a “special hello” to all in the room who have “known and loved me for many years. ” He says the politicians have asked for his endorsement and always wanted his money. He says when he ran for president as a Republican, they said he is a “  rotten, disgusting scoundrel. ” Trump says people thought he may have trouble with   jokes. And he says many have think modesty is his best quality, perhaps next to his temperament. Trump says Cardinal Dolan’s property is much more impressive because Trump built his with his   hands while his was built with the hands of God. “No contest,” he says.

Here’s what would have to happen to replace Trump on GOP ticket,"Washington (CNN) Donald Trump’s continued stumbles led The Wall Street Journal Monday to suggest that if he couldn’t shape up by Labor Day, it might be time to ”turn the nomination over to Mike Pence.” Replacing candidates on the ticket is fairly unprecedented, though Democrats replaced  . Thomas Eagleton on the 1972 ticket, following the revelation he used electroshock therapy. Any effort to remove Trump as the Republican presidential nominee would be  . But here are the two ways that Trump could be replaced at the top of the ticket. Trump removes himself, If Trump wanted out, he would have to alert the Republican National Committee, which would then have to convene and decide who to replace him with. The 168 members of the RNC would then vote to approve a new nominee.  But that’s only the start. The new nominee would have to be certified for the ballot in each state, and each state has separate deadlines, most of which are before or around Labor Day.  GOP removes Trump, A small group of   Republicans are mounting a   bid to remove Trump, arguing that the party rules allow the RNC to take him from the ballot.  ”We are supporting any and all efforts to look at the options of ensuring that a nominee is there who can beat Hillary Clinton in November,” said Dane Waters, a veteran GOP operative who is supporting this most recent effort to oust Trump. Free the Delegates, which Waters is a part of, failed in its bid to block Trump in Cleveland. It has also launched the GOP Accountability Project and a ”Recall Trump” effort    all focused on this   effort. Under their proposal,   Republicans would use the party’s ”Rule 8” and ”Rule 9” to call a special meeting of the RNC and then vote to fill the vacancy at the top of the ticket.  Rule 8 allows for a minimum of 16 RNC members from 16 separate states to petition for a special meeting of the RNC. And Rule 9 allows for the party fill a vacancy at the top of the ticket.  But there’s no rule that says the party can simply take its nomination away from Trump. Pence? He’s not the only option    it could be anyone    but that’s who the Journal suggested. He’s received plum marks from conservatives and party officials. But as a reminder, this is never going to happen."
It’s Conservatives Who Need ’Safe Places’ on Campus - Breitbart,"Students on college campuses across the country are getting therapy after being “traumatized” by a conservative speaker at their campus. The students did not actually attend the event or hear the speaker the mere fact that it was happening on their campus was traumatizing! [Very soon the mere possibility that a conservative speaker MIGHT appear on campus will be enough to spark a run on therapy appointments.  Obviously, there is a need for more “safe places” on university campuses, but not the kind we are reading about with the cascade of juvenile demands to be protected from “offensive speech. ” It’s Conservatives who are the persecuted minority needing “safe places” on college campuses, not the hypersensitive young totalitarians attempting to impose “speech codes” to enforce conformity to progressive orthodoxies and respect for leftist icons. Over the past year we have seen an acceleration of the corruption. There has been a veritable avalanche of media stories describing “safe place” protests on hundreds of campuses —   protests by “Black Lives Matter” and every leftist advocacy group that can find a student or faculty mouthpiece. Where is the news coverage of the very real plight of conservatives on campus, whose free speech rights are violated almost daily by organized violence and threats of violence? Conservative student groups cannot even invite a guest speaker to campus without fear of violent disruption of the event and retaliation against the sponsors. I have been personally victimized by organized disruption of a public lecture on a university campus  —   at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Michigan State University, and Rhode Island’s Providence College, to name only a few. In most cases, the only genuine victims of the “safe places” demands for censorship are conservative student groups and their invited guest speakers. Yet, the media portray the groups making the censorship demands as heroes for their progressive icons and “minority sensitivities. ” The rules of justice in the contemporary academy are upside down. Special protections are being created for the very people whose threats and violent behavior have silenced free speech and freedom of assembly. The special rights and privileges cherished and protected by universities for centuries now enjoy more respect and higher standing in the community outside the campus gates. Tolerance of true diversity on university campuses  —   diversity of opinion and belief —   has been eroding for decades while alumni and trustees looked the other way. Conservative faculty have been weeded out by faculty hiring committees, and progressives have taken control of administrative functions as well as the faculty lounge. Meanwhile, generations of “loyal alumni” continue to send their checks to help subsidize the corrupt enterprise while worshiping the icons and memories of a different era. This epidemic of student demands for “safe places” to protect against threatening words and ideas would make a great science fiction film, but unbelievably, events seem to be outpacing the political imagination. “Attack of the Trump 2016 chalk monsters” could have a terrific 1955 “” but at Emory University last March, “Trump 2016” chalked on sidewalks was the cause for a   therapy session, led by the president of the institution! Trump as President? Oh! My! God! It’s enough to give a progressive student nightmares —   and did, apparently. Emory University, you are in my prayers. At the University of Missouri, Columbia, Brown, Northwestern, Harvard, UCLA, Wisconsin, and at far away Oxford University, students are seeking therapy to deal with threats from unsavory ideas that allegedly are so inherently threatening that the mere uttering of certain words triggers a mental breakdown. Even Rolling Stone magazine, not having a fictional campus rape epidemic to exploit that particular week, devoted considerable space to the notion that students’ demands for safe places is a parody of our country’s public discourse. We need safe places everywhere! Yes, progressives do want to see censorship expanded beyond the campus so political correctness can be enforced in town halls and July 4th parades down Main Street. Honoring the admonition, “Better to light one candle than to curse the darkness,” conservatives are fighting back. Young America’s Foundation is suing California State University at Los Angeles (CSULA) for violation of students’ First Amendment rights after the school’s head tried to cancel guest speaker Ben Shapiro, and then failed to protect the public event from organized disruption. The Intercollegiate Studies Institute has been assisting conservative students since William F. Buckley, Jr. published his masterful chronicle of liberal intolerance, God and Man at Yale. And conservative alumni are organizing to use financial leverage to restore civility and accountability to university life through such groups as the American Council of Trustees and Alumni."
Will The Clintons Finally Be Held Accountable for Their Corruption? Maybe - Breitbart,"News that the FBI has expanded its probe of Hillary Clinton to include “public corruption” involving the Clinton Foundation is a massive step forward in the investigation of possible corruption involving the Clintons. [It’s no longer about emails. It’s about money and possible payoffs during her tenure as Secretary of State.  I take note that according to Catherine Herridge, the FBI began this track of its investigation of Hillary Clinton in April 2015. That of course just happens to be as my book Clinton Cash was about to be released and was being widely reported by the New York Times, Washington Post and, of course, Breitbart. The point here is that credible news organizations saw what I saw early on: that there is a clear pattern of money going to the Clintons and the Clinton Foundation around the time that Hillary Clinton was making important decisions that involved those who were sending them the money. As the New York Times confirmed in a 4, 000 word front page article, the Clintons bagged some $145 million for the Clinton Foundation from nine shareholders and executives tied to a uranium company that the Russians desperately wanted to buy. Clinton defenders, including ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos, grilled me and repeatedly said that there was “no smoking gun. ” But of course as any prosecutor will tell you, there is rarely a smoking gun. And to suggest that you need one to prove criminal guilt is preposterous. In recent political corruption cases, including former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey, there was no smoking gun. And indeed, there was nowhere near the pattern of financial transactions that exist with the Clintons. Herridge quotes an unnamed intelligence source as saying FBI agents would be “screaming” if there is no prosecution because “many previous public corruption cases have been made and successfully prosecuted with much less evidence than what is emerging in this investigation. ” Regardless of a person’s politics, a key component of any government is the laws and rules that apply to everyone equally. Why are the Clintons granted a different standard than other politicians, where Republicans or Democrats? Why are they allowed to go places in   that others would never dream of? The FBI will be under enormous political pressure by the Obama Administration to make this all go away. Right now it appears they are not going to play ball with the White House."
NBC anchor grills Mike Pence on immigration: ’Fair to say you’re not going to answer this question?’,"’  ’ ’   NBC anchor Chuck Todd grilled Indiana Gov. Mike Pence on Sunday   over   ’ ’   ”Why can’’t you definitively say what’’s going to happen to these   folks?”   ”Because he used to definitively say it. He   said there would be  —   everybody has to leave. And now there’’s   some muddiness to this.” ’ ”   Trump’s running mate did not address the question directly,   instead emphasizing that the   magnate has a     immigration plan that includes forcing Mexico to pay for a wall   along the Southern US border, hiring additional Immigration and   Customs Enforcement agents, and deporting some immigrants who   have committed violent crimes and people who overstay their   visas. ” ’   ”With regard to anyone that remains after all of that is done, I   think what you heard Donald Trump say is that we’’ll give   consideration, working with the Congress, in a new and reformed   immigration system, to consider it at that time,” Pence said. ’ ’   ”But what the American people want to see today is to establish   the borders of this country, enforce the laws of this country.   And Donald Trump has created a road map to do that.” ’ ’’ ’   But when Pence assured Todd that Trump was ”completely   consistent” on immigration, Todd interjected, saying that Trump’’s   position on the issue has not been consistent. ’ ’   ”Is it fair to say that you’’re not going to answer this question   about the 11 to 15 million? I say just you, but the campaign.   You’’re going to leave this as an open question throughout the   rest of this campaign?” Todd said. ’ ’   The governor maintained that a Trump administration would address   what to do about millions of immigrants living in the US only   after it ended illegal immigration completely. ’ ”   Pence accepted that this would create a limbo for some immigrants    —   he vowed to overturn President Barack Obama’s executive actions   offering some benefits like work permits to  ” ’   ”Down the road, at the right time, after we’’ve put first things   first, then we can consider how we resolve these other issues,”   Pence said. ’ ’   Pence has repeatedly dodged direct questions about what Trump   plans to do about millions of immigrants living in the US without   permission who have not committed crimes beyond entering the US   illegally or overstaying their visa. ’ ”   CNN’s Jake Tapper  last week when questioning Pence about the   subject, which Trump’s campaign assured would be resolved during   his major immigration speech last Wednesday. ” ’   ”To be clear, you did not address the issue whether or not there   will be a deportation force removing the 11 million, but I don’’t   want to spend the entire interview on that one subject,” Tapper   told Pence following a   exchange over the deportation   force. ’"
The Savvy Person’s Guide to Reading the Latest Polls - The New York Times,"You’ve probably heard that it’s always best to focus on the average of polls. The poll results that often get the most attention are outliers  —   they get attention because they’re shocking, not because they’re representative. But we also know that people often ignore that advice. They want to know the details of the newest poll, and how and why it might be different from the last. And to tell you the truth, I do, too. I read the details and methodology of almost every survey that is released. The problem is that it’s a lot harder than it looks. After a splashy poll is released, Twitter is often overflowing with   but misguided analysis.  It’s true: You really are better off looking at the averages. But if you’re going to assess individual polls this election, here’s a guide on how to do it well. When a poll comes out, I start by looking at the topline results  —   Hillary Clinton is plus 3 percentage points, or Donald J. Trump is plus 1, for example. But it’s also worth looking at vote share  —   whether Mrs. Clinton has 47 percent or 40 percent, for instance. In particular, I care about how close the leading candidate is to 50 percent. There’s more uncertainty the further a candidate is from 50 percent and the larger the number of undecided voters. Until a candidate approaches 50 percent, it’s hard to know whether the lead is because of party unity or because the candidate has won over the key voters needed for victory. This is especially true in a reliably red or blue state: A Democrat who has 40 percent of the vote in Arizona still has a lot to prove, even with a lead. He or she hasn’t yet won the   voters who decide the state’s elections. There was a good example of this in the Arizona Senate race. A lot of polls showed John McCain narrowly ahead, or even behind. But once he won the G. O. P. primary,   voters returned to his side. Usually, anything at 46 percent or above is a good indicator of real strength. Less than that, and you have to wonder about undecided voters. ■ It’s also worth looking at whether there’s a difference between registered and likely voters. In a presidential election year, I generally prefer looking at the registered voter numbers  —   with a caveat. That’s because many methods that screen for likely voters are poor and yield noisy data. Registered voter samples are larger, and there aren’t additional questions to add statistical noise. But here’s the caveat: Registered voter polls tend to overrepresent Democrats, so I often focus on the registered voter number and mentally shift it a point or two toward the Republicans. ■ This year, there’s also the question of whether to look at   or   polls. I’m not sold on which is best. This year’s   candidates don’t have the strong bases of a Ross Perot or John Anderson. It’s possible that the polls that name them will overestimate their support it’s possible that the polls that do not name them will underestimate their support. For now, I’m inclined to split the difference. To get a sense of whether a poll is good or bad news for a certain candidate, I usually compare the results of the poll with the polling averages or the last poll conducted by the same pollster. ■ If the poll is very different from the polling average, there’s a good chance it’s an outlier. ■ If the poll shows a big shift from a prior survey, I also wonder whether the previous poll was an outlier. If so, a candidate might appear to rebound simply because he or she was unusually weak in a prior poll. So compare that prior poll with the average of the time, too. ■ It’s also worth looking at whether the candidate has gained or lost vote share. When candidates fall without good reason, I often assume they’re likelier than not to win back their former supporters. I definitely take note when candidates have won more supporters than they’ve won before. If that happens a lot, it’s a real sign of strength. ■ I also look at the various measures of whether Mr. Trump has a ceiling: like a 50 percent “very unfavorable” rating, or 50 percent who say they would be scared of a Trump presidency. I’m not convinced that those measures actually represent a ceiling. But they very well might, and I am curious about whether he’s making progress by those measures. I also care a lot about how the poll was conducted. Polling is hard. A lot of things can go wrong, from question wording to weighting a sample or selecting likely voters. These choices can make a big difference  —   even with the same data. Worse, there are very few pollsters that really provide enough information to know whether they’re making reasonable choices  —   and what the consequences of those decisions might be. As a result, I strongly prefer experienced firms with solid track records. ■ I have serious problems with IVR polls (interactive voice response). These are sometimes called   and they don’t have any means to contact voters with a cellphone. This is a problem for even an experienced firm with a good record. It can be disastrous for firms without much  . ■ I have reservations about online polls. It’s harder to draw a representative sample online because you can’t rely on traditional random sampling. There are skilled and experienced pollsters that do a good job, like YouGov and SurveyMonkey. But there’s a somewhat higher burden for online pollsters to build solid track records, make good hires and publish a detailed methodology. ■ If the poll is from a less established firm, I’ll give a closer look if it has been transparent  —   if the pollsters publish a detailed methodology that gives me a better sense of what I’m getting. You don’t have to analyze every detail of a poll’s methodology, but here are some rules of thumb: ■ A   poll is often a bad poll. You usually need multiple days to call voters back and get a representative sample. ■ Well over half of adults ought to be reached on cellphones in a typical national survey about 40 percent of Americans do not have a landline at all. A poll of registered voters off the voter file can have a somewhat smaller number of   voters, since the poll can typically be weighted by partisanship, and registered and likely voters are less likely to have only a cellphone (they’re older, more affluent and often less mobile than the population as a whole). ■ Pay attention to sample size. If a poll has a small sample  —   less than 800 people or so  —   be aware that sampling error will play a bigger role than usual. The gains from big samples are smaller than you might think, so don’t give a lot of extra credit for a poll that goes much higher than 1, 200. Often, the polls with huge samples are actually just using cheap and problematic sampling methods. If the sample is less than 400, the result should be considered no more than a ballpark estimate. ■ I don’t usually pay much attention to the margin of error because it does not even come close to approximating the actual potential for error in a survey. And pollsters calculate margin of error somewhat differently. In particular, I see a lot of   firms that don’t adjust their margins of error to account for the effect of weighting  —   making their poll seem more confident than it is. The country is deeply divided along demographic lines, which makes it very important to check on the demographic composition of the sample. But this is not so simple to do. ■ Know the polling universe: adults, registered voters and likely voters. This is trickier than you might suppose. Often, a poll of registered or likely voters will report the demographic composition of the overall sample of adults  —   generally a much more diverse group. That doesn’t tell you about the demographic makeup of registered or likely voters. ■ Know the targets. Almost all pollsters adjust their sample to match demographics, like age, race and gender. If a pollster isn’t weighting for something fundamental like that, it’s a big warning sign: See for yourself whether the poll is off by a wide margin on those measures (sometimes, they’re fine). It’s also worth looking at education or party registration. Not every poll weights by those measures, and sometimes that’s a mistake. ■ The exit polls are not the word of God. There are legitimate debates about the electorate. Many of these debates center on differences between estimates based on the census, voter files or exit polls. Most polls are on the end of the spectrum showing a whiter sample, since most polls use voter file and census data. Many times, polls get slammed on social media for being “too white” in comparison with the exit polls, even though they’re near the consensus of more reliable measures. ■ Wrong is wrong. In general, I wouldn’t criticize a poll if the electorate fell somewhere in the debatable range around the exit polls, census and voter file. But if a pollster leaves the debatable range, it’s probably just wrong. It may even indicate colossal failures in weighting or sampling. The poll can be dismissed out of hand on this basis alone. Examples of what I mean: a poll showing that more than 45 percent of the electorate in Pennsylvania will be over age 65 (that’s too high) or that 13 percent of the electorate will be black in North Carolina (that’s too low). ■ I really don’t look at party identification. We have no idea what the “right” partisan breakdown of the electorate really is: It’s an attitude, not a nearly fixed characteristic. Depending on the news or the national political environment,   or   voters can switch in and out of the “unaffiliated” or “independent” column. It is very clear that there are more   Democrats than Republicans in the country, which has been true for about a decade. But I will look at party registration, if it’s available from the voter file. That’s a pretty fixed characteristic: It doesn’t swing with the mood. ■ When I look through the polling crosstabs for subgroups  —   like young people or black voters  —   I compare with old polls, not the exit polls. The two measures are irreconcilable, and a direct comparison introduces a lot of bias. It will generally show, for instance, Democrats doing better among white voters even as they’re not doing better over all. ■ Subgroups are noisy, and that’s fine. I often see a lot of people who dig into the polls and find a crosstab that doesn’t make sense  —   maybe Hispanic voters give Hillary Clinton only 55 percent of the vote. Well, that’s O. K. For one, it matters a lot less than you might think (giving Mrs. Clinton an additional   shift among Hispanic voters will boost her national vote share by just two points). And subsamples are noisy by nature. It might be canceled out by noise elsewhere in the sample, either by chance or for a more structural reason. An underappreciated fact is that polls are usually adjusted for the right number of voters by race, age and gender, but subgroups don’t each have the right demographic composition. There won’t necessarily be the right number of young,   female Hispanics, or old, less educated white men. So a Hispanic subsample could be too old and male, but in exchange, some other part of the electorate is too young and female. ■ A lot of polls conducted off voter registration files will select a certain set of past voters, like people who have voted in the last two elections in addition to those who are newly registered. These decisions can exclude less likely voters, who may vote differently. That’s a problem. I get even more concerned when I see a   screen on top of a sample that was already especially likely to vote. I could go on. But these are the basics of my mental checklist in judging whether an individual poll might maintain the status quo, move the needle or stand as an outlier. And then I go back to the poll averages."
Michael Flynn Resigns as National Security Adviser - The New York Times,"Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser, resigned on Monday night after it was revealed that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other top White House officials about his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Mr. Flynn, who served in the job for less than a month, said he had given “incomplete information” regarding a telephone call he had with the ambassador in late December about American sanctions against Russia, weeks before President Trump’s inauguration. Mr. Flynn previously had denied that he had any substantive conversations with Ambassador Sergey I. Kislyak, and Mr. Pence repeated that claim in television interviews as recently as this month. But on Monday, a former administration official said the Justice Department warned the White House last month that Mr. Flynn had not been fully forthright about his conversations with the ambassador. As a result, the Justice Department feared that Mr. Flynn could be vulnerable to blackmail by Moscow. In his resignation letter, which the White House emailed to reporters, Mr. Flynn said he had held numerous calls with foreign officials during the transition. “Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the vice   and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador,” he wrote. “I have sincerely apologized to the president and the vice president, and they have accepted my apology. ” “I am tendering my resignation, honored to have served our nation and the American people in such a distinguished way,” Mr. Flynn wrote. The White House said in the statement that it was replacing Mr. Flynn with retired Lt. Gen. Joseph K. Kellogg Jr. of the Army, a Vietnam War veteran, as acting national security adviser. Mr. Flynn was an early and ardent supporter of Mr. Trump’s candidacy, and in his resignation he sought to praise the president. “In just three weeks,” Mr. Flynn said, the new president “has reoriented American foreign policy in fundamental ways to restore America’s leadership position in the world. ” But in doing so, he inadvertently illustrated the brevity of his tumultuous run at the National Security Council, and the chaos that has gripped the White House in the first weeks of the Trump administration  —   and created a sense of uncertainty around the world. Earlier Monday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, told reporters that “the president is evaluating the situation” about Mr. Flynn’s future. By Monday evening, Mr. Flynn’s fortunes were rapidly shifting  —   his resignation came roughly seven hours after Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to the president, said on MSNBC that Mr. Trump had “full confidence” in the retired general. And when he did step down, it happened so quickly that his resignation does not appear to have been communicated to National Security Council staff members, two of whom said they learned about it from news reports. Officials said Mr. Pence had told others in the White House that he believed Mr. Flynn lied to him by saying he had not discussed the topic of sanctions on a call with the Russian ambassador in late December. Even the mere discussion of policy  —   and the apparent attempt to assuage the concerns of an American adversary before Mr. Trump took office  —   represented a remarkable breach of protocol. The F. B. I. had been examining Mr. Flynn’s phone calls as he came under growing questions about his interactions with Russian officials and his management of the National Security Council. The blackmail risk envisioned by the Justice Department would have stemmed directly from Mr. Flynn’s attempt to cover his tracks with his bosses. The Russians knew what had been said on the call thus, if they wanted Mr. Flynn to do something, they could have threatened to expose the lie if he refused. The Justice Department’s warning to the White House was first reported on Monday night by The Washington Post. In addition, the Army has been investigating whether Mr. Flynn received money from the Russian government during a trip he took to Moscow in 2015, according to two defense officials. Such a payment might violate the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which prohibits former military officers from receiving money from a foreign government without consent from Congress. The defense officials said there was no record that Mr. Flynn, a retired   Army general, filed the required paperwork for the trip. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement late Monday that Mr. Flynn’s resignation would not close the question of his contact with Russian officials. “General Flynn’s decision to step down as national security adviser was all but ordained the day he misled the country about his secret talks with the Russian ambassador,” said Mr. Schiff, noting that the matter is still under investigation by the House committee. Two other Democratic lawmakers  —   Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan and Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland  —   called for an immediate briefing by the Justice Department and the F. B. I. over the “alarming new disclosures” that Mr. Flynn was a blackmail risk. “We need to know who else within the White House is a current and ongoing risk to our national security,” they said in a statement. Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and the chairman of the House intelligence committee, was supportive of Mr. Flynn until the end. “Washington, D. C. can be a rough town for honorable people, and Flynn  —   who has always been a soldier, not a politician  —   deserves America’s gratitude and respect,” Mr. Nunes said in a statement. The White House had examined a transcript of a wiretapped conversation that Mr. Flynn had with Mr. Kislyak in December, according to administration officials. Mr. Flynn originally told Mr. Pence and others that the call was limited to small talk and holiday pleasantries. But the conversation, according to officials who saw the transcript of the wiretap, also included a discussion about sanctions imposed on Russia after intelligence agencies determined that President Vladimir V. Putin’s government tried to interfere with the 2016 election on Mr. Trump’s behalf. Still, current and former administration officials familiar with the call said the transcript was ambiguous enough that Mr. Trump could have justified either firing or retaining Mr. Flynn. Mr. Trump, however, had become increasingly concerned about the continued fallout over Mr. Flynn’s behavior, according to people familiar with his thinking, and told aides that the media storm around Mr. Flynn would damage the president’s image on national security issues. Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, asked for Mr. Flynn’s resignation  —   a move that he has been pushing for since Friday, when it became clear that the national security adviser had misled Mr. Pence. Around 8:20 p. m. Monday, a sullen Mr. Flynn was seen in the Oval Office, just as preparations were being made for the   of newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. Soon after, Mr. Flynn’s resignation letter started making the rounds. Administration officials said it was unlikely that Mr. Kellogg would be asked to stay on as Mr. Flynn’s permanent replacement. Mr. Flynn brought Mr. Kellogg into the Trump campaign, according to a former campaign adviser, and the two have remained close. K. T. McFarland, the deputy national security adviser who also was brought on by Mr. Flynn, is expected to leave that role, a senior official said. One person close to the administration, who was not authorized to discuss the personnel moves and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that retired Vice Admiral Robert S. Harward is the leading candidate to replace Mr. Flynn, although Mr. Kellogg and David H. Petraeus are being discussed. It was not clear whether Mr. Petraeus is still expected to appear at the White House this week, as initially discussed by advisers to the president. Mr. Flynn’s concealment of the call’s content, combined with questions about his management of his agency and reports of a demoralized staff, put him in a precarious position less than a month into Mr. Trump’s presidency. Few members of Mr. Trump’s team were more skeptical of Mr. Flynn than the vice president, numerous administration officials said. Mr. Pence, who used the false information provided by Mr. Flynn to defend him in a series of television appearances, was incensed at Mr. Flynn’s lack of contrition for repeatedly embarrassing him by withholding the information, according to three administration officials familiar with the situation. Mr. Flynn and Mr. Pence spoke twice in the past few days about the matter, but administration officials said that rather than fully apologize and accept responsibility, the national security adviser blamed his faulty memory  —   which irked the typically    Mr. Pence. The slight was compounded by an episode late last year when Mr. Pence went on television to deny that Mr. Flynn’s son, who had posted conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton on social media, had been given a security clearance by the transition team. The younger Mr. Flynn had, indeed, been given such a clearance, even though his father had told Mr. Pence’s team that he had not. Officials said classified information did not appear to have been discussed during the conversation between Mr. Flynn and the ambassador, which would have been a crime. The call was captured on a routine wiretap of diplomats’ calls, the officials said. But current Trump administration officials and former Obama administration officials said that Mr. Flynn did appear to be reassuring the ambassador that Mr. Trump would adopt a more accommodating tone on Russia once in office. Former and current administration officials said that Mr. Flynn urged Russia not to retaliate against any sanctions because an overreaction would make any future cooperation more complicated. He never explicitly promised sanctions relief, one former official said, but he appeared to leave the impression that it would be possible. During his 2015 trip to Moscow, Mr. Flynn was paid to attend the anniversary celebration of Russia Today, a television network controlled by the Kremlin. At the banquet, he sat next to Mr. Putin. Mr. Flynn had notified the Defense Intelligence Agency, which he once led, that he was taking the trip. He received a security briefing from agency officials before he left, which is customary for former top agency officials when they travel overseas. Still, some senior agency officials were surprised when footage of the banquet appeared on RT, and believed that Mr. Flynn should have been more forthcoming with the agency about the nature of his trip to Russia."

Powerline Backs #DumpKelloggs: ‘Companies Like Kellogg Need to Understand That Ours is Not a One-Party State’,"John Hinderaker of the conservative blog Powerline offers support for Breitbart’s #DumpKelloggs boycott, noting that if Kellogg’s wants to align itself with “a vicious, bullying   minority,” then they “should understand that such decisions have consequences” because we do not live in “a   state. ” [From Powerline:  Internet ad buys are placed in enormous quantities. An advertiser like Kellogg has no idea where its ads will wind up. They are all over the internet. Very possibly, some have appeared on Power Line, although I can’t recall any cereal ads offhand. Kellogg would have to go out of its way to identify a site like Breitbart. com that it wants to block from displaying its ads. This, apparently, Kellogg is willing to pay to have done, lest it have some ostensible association with the candidate who was just elected President of the United States. The company will continue advertising on Democratic Party sites. I am not generally a fan of boycotts, but this, like so much else in our civic life, has been a   street. Executives at companies like Kellogg need to understand that ours is not a   state. For decades, surveys have shown that   conservatives outnumber liberals by a ratio of one and a half to two to one. If Kellogg wants to go out of its way to align itself with a vicious, bullying   minority, fine. But the company should understand that such decisions have consequences. No more Frosted Flakes. No more Fruit Loops. No more Rice Krispies. No more  . Read the rest here. "
Lagerfeld: Meryl Streep Wanted Money to Wear Chanel to Oscars,"Iconic fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld claims Meryl Streep wanted to be paid to wear one of his Chanel dresses to the 2017 Academy Awards. [Streep was reportedly set to wear Chanel on the red carpet before one of her handlers allegedly informed the fashion house to halt production of the dress.   “I made a sketch, and we started to make the dress,” Lagerfeld told WWD. The German designer said someone from Streep’s team called days later and said, “Don’t continue the dress. We found somebody who will pay us. ” “A genius actress, but cheapness also, no?” he said.  Streep, who’s nominated for Best Actress for her role in Florence Foster Jenkins, denied that she demanded money to wear a dress at Sunday’s awards ceremony. A representative for the three time   said the claim is “absolutely false,” according to The Hollywood Reporter. Lagerfeld told WWD that it is Chanel policy not to pay entertainers to wear their couture to awards shows, despite what other fashion houses might do. “After we gift her a dress that’s 100, 000 euros [$105, 000] we found later we had to pay [for her to wear it]. We give them dresses, we make the dresses, but we don’t pay,” Lagerfeld explained.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson"
"Mike Flynn, Breitbart’s Secretary of War - Breitbart","It still hasn’t really sunk in that Mike Flynn is no longer among us. I was away on business when I learned of his passing. I am numb and in denial in a way. [I always thought of Mike as some kind of avenging angel with a fiery sword meting out divine punishment on the heads of those aiming to turn America into something ugly.  So to describe Mike as a “happy warrior” doesn’t seem to do justice to his work. He wasn’t just a foot soldier following orders (not that there’s anything wrong with that). He was a genius capable of running an entire war effort. Mike didn’t believe in avoiding conflict. “Always engage,” “always play offense,” were phrases I heard from him all the time. Mike brought me into the Breitbart. com journalism family and recruited me to help bring down ACORN, the nastiest, most criminally inclined, radical   gangster group ever to shake down a business, orchestrate a home invasion with the help of squatters, smash up furniture at a city council meeting, or send an angry mob to scare the bejeezus out of a bank official’s little children in their home. With Mike helming BigGovernment. com, a crack team of writers and researchers absolutely flooded the zone in 2009 when James O’Keefe and Hannah Giles’s brilliant undercover sting videos of ACORN intake workers helping to facilitate serious crimes were published. Mike was passionate, righteous, relentless, and indefatigable. We waged war against these people day after day, cut off their taxpayer funding, and drove them into bankruptcy. “The Left has never seen the likes of us,” he once observed in the heat of battle. “The Left has no capacity for dealing with us. ” We beat the hoodlum socialists of ACORN and Mike had everything to do with it. Like my friend Andrew Breitbart, Mike Flynn was a friend who sucked the marrow out of life and lived large. Mike, like Andrew, was a force of nature, taken far too soon from those who love America. When the numbness subsides, I’ll raise a glass to toast this great, wonderful man."
Jet-skiing jugs and other trophy tales," (CNN) Stories abound of golf’s Claret Jug overflowing with assorted beverages, but British Open champion Henrik Stenson was more interested in thrills than spills when he took the famous trophy jet skiing. The Swede overcame Phil Mickelson in an epic   duel to win his first major title at Royal Troon in July, and recently invited CNN’s Living Golf to hang out at his Florida home.   Stenson took to Lake Nona on his jet ski    and treated the   Jug, snug in a   life jacket, to a   spin.    Both golfer and Jug returned to shore unharmed, but not every holder has taken such good care . ..   One day, while practicing a few swings indoors, 1982 champion Tom Watson knocked the Jug off a nearby table, causing a serious dent.  Trouble was, Watson had accidentally been handed the original 1873 trophy, not the 1928 replica normally given to that year’s champion. Watson attempted emergency surgery and maintains nobody noticed. Stolen, The 2015 winner Zach Johnson damaged the Jug on a visit to Minneapolis and took it to a silversmith.  Johnson stressed the importance and value of the trophy, but the silversmith said he was well aware what it was    he’d worked on it before, when 2009 champion and Minnesota local Stewart Cink had taken it in to the same shop for repairs after his kids damaged it. Then there was 1996 champion Tom Lehman, who one night he received a phone call from police thinking the Jug had been stolen. They had apprehended a woman in possession in a bar.  It turned out she was Alissa Herron, sister of Cink’s friend and fellow PGA Tour player Tim Herron.  Lehman had taken the trophy to a charity dinner and forgotten about it, whereupon Cink’s wife Melissa had handed it to Alissa for safekeeping. Ladybirds, Accidents are one thing. Badly damaging rugby’s famous Calcutta Cup    awarded to the winner of the annual fixture between England and Scotland    while using it as a ball on Edinburgh’s Princes Street is something else.  Scotland’s John Jeffrey and England’s Dean Richards were the culprits on a boisterous   night out in 1988.  Jeffrey was banned for five months, while Richards was suspended for one game. In more innocent endeavors, Padraig Harrington’s son used the Claret Jug to house his ladybird collection after the first of his dad’s two Open victories in 2007. READ: All the Presidents’ clubs go under the hammer, But most tales concern the different beverages poured into it    a rite of passage for Open champions.  ’Good stuff’ From Coca Cola, to iced tea (Justin Leonard’s mum) to various beers, Guinness, Jagermeister (Rory McIlroy in a Belfast nightclub) champagne and fine wine, virtually anything is fair game.  Cink also used the Jug as a dish for barbecue dip, while Johnson ate corn on the cob out of it in a nod to his home state of Iowa.   The 2013 winner Mickelson revealed he first poured in a bottle of 1990      a $40, 000 red wine.  ”One of the things that I stressed is that we have to treat the claret jug with reverence and respect that it deserves and only put good stuff in it,” he said in his Monday news conference in the week of the 2014 Open. At which point one oenophile among the assembled reporters pointed out that particular wine is a Burgundy, not a Claret.  READ: South Korean domination    ’You’re either a champion or nothing’ Darren Clarke, the 2011 champion at Royal St. George’s, decided out of reverence he wouldn’t drink anything from the Jug, despite his reputation as a bon viveur. But Clarke’s story with the Jug concerns an incident when he was stopped by police for speeding on his way to a tournament in Ireland two weeks later. When the officers saw the trophy, they let Clarke off with a warning on the condition they could have their pictures taken with it. The Masters Green Jacket is another revered sporting prize and one with a long list of rules attached. Which is why Mickelson wearing his on a trip to Augusta’s Krispy Kreme   after his victory in 2010 raised eyebrows.    Not that Mickelson broke any rules    the champion is able to take his jacket home for a year.  But its use is personal and limited to   activity, which is why Nick Faldo was in hot water with Augusta’s authorities when he let the late UK chat show host Terry Wogan try his on after his second Masters success in 1990.   South Africa’s Gary Player went one step further, taking his jacket back home for a second time the year after his 1961 victory.  Player got a call from Augusta’s chairman Clifford Roberts, saying he was not supposed to have taken his jacket off the premises. ”I said, ’Mr. Roberts, if you want it, you better come and fetch it,’ recalls Player. ”He appreciated the humor and told me I must never wear it around. It’s in a plastic bag in my closet.” ’Number two’ Ice hockey’s Stanley Cup has also been the centerpiece for various shenanigans. The New York Rangers burned off the mortgage on Madison Square Garden in the Cup after winning in 1940 and seemingly brought a curse upon themselves after having to wait another 54 years to win it again. Colorado Avalanche’s Sylvain Lefebvre had his first child   baptized in the trophy in 1996, while Doug Weight filled it with a giant ice cream sundae for his kids after the Caroline Hurricanes’ 2006 victory.  Fortunately for Weight, that came two years before Red Wings’ Kris Draper used it as a seat for his newborn daughter, who did what babies do best. ”I still drank out of it that night,” Draper said later.  Good dog, Sailing’s Auld Mug    the America’s Cup    is known as the oldest trophy in international sport after being first awarded in 1851. It is now so valuable it travels everywhere first class with a permanent security guard. Which is what soccer’s World Cup    originally the Jules Rimet Trophy     could have done with when it was stolen before the 1966 tournament in England.  Visit cnn.  more more news and videos, The trophy was on display at Westminster’s Central Hall when thieves struck between security sweeps and removed the trophy from its cabinet. A week later, a dog named Pickles sniffed at a parcel wrapped in newspaper under the hedge in his owner David Corbett’s garden in southeast London. It was the World Cup, and Pickles became a national hero. The trophy was handed to Brazil in perpetuity in 1970 for winning three times and a new one made    the FIFA World Cup Trophy. But the original was stolen again in Brazil in 1983 and never recovered.  Have your say on CNN Sport’s Facebook page, If they could talk, sport’s famous old trophies could tell plenty more tales.   "
The Department of Justice just asked the ’sheriff of Wall Street’ to resign after Trump asked him to stay on,"’  ’ ’ appointed by   President Barack Obama asked to resign on Friday by Attorney   General Jeff Sessions, one name seemed at least slightly curious:   Preet Bharara, the US attorney for the Southern District of New   York. ’ ”   That’s because President Donald Trump invited him to Trump Tower   in late November during the transition period and asked him to   stay on at his post. ” ’   Following their meeting on November 30, Bharara told reporters he   ”agreed to stay on” after speaking with the   . ’ ’   ”The   asked, presumably because he’’s a New Yorker   and is aware of the great work that our office has done over the   past seven years, asked to meet with me to discuss whether or not   I’’d be prepared to stay on as the United States attorney to do   the work as we have done it, independently, without fear or favor   for the last seven years,” Bharara said. ’ ’   ”I have already spoken to Sen. Sessions, who is, as you know, is   the nominee to be the attorney general,” he continued. ”He also   asked that I stay on, and so I expect that I will be continuing   to work at the southern district.” ’ ’’ ’   One of the   US attorneys, Bharara built a   reputation on vigorously going after corruption cases involving   New York elected officials and aides of those office holders. In   addition, the Wall Street industry was within his scope as US   attorney. ’ ’   Currently, his office is looking into a case related to a top   adviser of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, as well as a probe into   allegations that New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio and his   allies engaged in a   .  ’ ”   The Friday move by the Justice Department was to ask for the   resignations of all remaining US attorney’s appointed by Obama.   The move is not unusual. For example, soon after President   Bill Clinton first took office, asked all 93 US attorneys to   resign on the same day. The attorneys are political appointees. ” ’   ”As was the case in prior transitions, many of the United States   Attorneys nominated by the previous administration already have   left the Department of Justice,” Justice Department   spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores  in an email. ”The   Attorney General has now asked the remaining 46 presidentially   appointed US Attorneys to tender their resignations in order to   ensure a uniform transition.” ’ ’   ”Until the new US Attorneys are confirmed, the dedicated career   prosecutors in our US Attorney’s Offices will continue the great   work of the department in investigating, prosecuting, and   deterring the most violent offenders.” ’ ’   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer released a statement on   Friday evening expressing his troubles with the requests for   resignations. ’ ’   ”I’m troubled to learn of reports of requests for resignations   from the remaining US attorneys, particularly that of Preet   Bharara, after the president initiated a call to me in   November and assured me he wanted Mr. Bharara to continue to   serve as U. S. Attorney for the Southern District,” Schumer said.   ”While it’s true that presidents from both parties made their own   choices for U. S. Attorney positions across the country, they have   always done so in an orderly fashion that doesn’t put ongoing   investigations at risk. They ask for letters of resignation but   the attorneys are allowed to stay on the job until their   successor is confirmed.” ’ ’   ”By asking for the immediate resignation of every remaining US   attorney before their replacements have been confirmed or even   nominated, the president is interrupting ongoing cases and   investigations and hindering the administration of justice,” The   New York Democrat continued. ’ ’   The call for the resignations came less than a day after Fox   News host Sean Hannity  —   an unabashed Trump supporter with a   massive audience  —   called for a ”purge” of the Justice   Department employees appointed by Obama during his opening   monologue. ’ ”Among the 46 US attorney’s appointed by. ..” ’’ ’’ ’’"
Milo Tears Into Hillary-Supporting Podcast Host in Epic Free Speech Rant - Breitbart,"Breitbart’s Milo Yiannopoulos joined Chris Paul on the “None Taken” podcast recently, where he ended up tearing into Paul for his hypocrisy in supporting Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, despite being a free speech activist. [“So you’re voting for Hillary are you?” asked Milo in disappointment.  “Yes, I am. I’m a pragmatist, I want the best results,” replied Paul. “Disgusting, absolutely disgusting. As somebody who cares about culture, you should be ashamed of voting for a president who is going to make certain kinds of speech on campus illegal,” Milo proclaimed. “You’ve spent the first   minutes of this show discussing with me your distaste for all the left’s constant attack on free speech, free inquiry. Hillary Clinton, not Sanders, Hillary Clinton is the greatest imaginable threat to the free speech you cherish so much. She is the one that sucks up and panders to Black Lives Matter, more than Sanders does, which is why they charged his stage and not hers. Look at the people she appoints. Look at the black community, always votes for the Clintons. Why? Because the Clintons tell them they’re going to give them what they want, and they put people in office when they’re there. ” “I accept the pandering as a lesser evil,” interrupted Paul. “Well, not when you are arrested for ‘hate speech’ about saying the wrong thing about black crime rates. Then you won’t,” rebutted Milo. “Look at the relationship she has with the worst kind of whiny, lesbianic institutional feminism. Title nine is nothing compared to what Hillary will do to American universities when she gets in office. The way that men are treated on campuses today is deplorable, and I presume you agree with me on that, this is nothing compared to after eight years of a Clinton presidency. All of the things you claim you care about are at so much greater risk from a Hillary presidency than anybody else that ran for president in this cycle. Anybody who’s now dropped out, O’Malley, you know, or anybody on the Republican side too, there is no person running for president in this cycle of any stripe, whether they’re still running or not, more of a risk to the things you say you care about than Hillary Clinton. It is so shocking to me that you suggest you’re going to vote for her. ” “I will not deny you that, I just will  …    ” replied Paul. “So you’re gonna vote for her anyway, even though she’s the greatest threat to all the things you care about? That’s insane,” Milo expressed. You can listen to their entire encounter on the issue below: Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

Police Chief Blames Merkel Policy for Death of Maria L.,"German police union chief Rainer Wendt has blamed the mass migration policies of German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the death of Maria Landenburger who was killed by an Afghani migrant. [Mr. Wendt said, “This and many other victims would not exist if our country would have been prepared for the dangers that are always associated with massive immigration,” Die Welt reports.  Wendt also spoke of   supporters criticising their attitudes toward mass migration saying “while relatives mourn and victims experience unspeakable suffering, the representatives of the ‘welcome culture’ are silent” adding that they had “not a word of compassion, nowhere there is   only arrogant insistence on one’s own noble disposition”. He then said that the harsh realities of the migrant policy of Angela Merkel was being “passed over to the victims and to a police and judiciary, which had been spared for years. And so the dangers for our country are constantly growing” he noted. Several other politicians and public figures have weighed in after the announcement over the weekend that the perpetrator of the rape and murder was an underage Afghan migrant who had come during the migrant crisis.  Former Socialist Party mayor of   Heinz Buschkowsky said: “The perpetrator came from a brutal, patriarchal society and behaved towards women as if they were always available. It will take generations to change this attitude so people will learn our central European world of values. ” However, many other politicians decided to use the opportunity to claim that not all migrants should be held under suspicion despite the huge wave of crime associated with the migrant crisis over the past year. Socialist Party leader Sigmar Gabriel said: “We must not allow this abominable act to be abused for agitation and conspiracy propaganda. It is clear to all: Refugees can commit just as terrible crimes as people born in Germany. ” The murder of Maria echoes that of Alexandra Mezher in Sweden earlier this year. Both Alexandra and Maria worked in asylum homes and while both wanted to help migrants they ended up the victims of   violence. Police in Freiburg continue to investigate the case and some question whether or not the Afghan migrant suspected of the crime was also involved in a similar case in  the nearby town of Endingen in which a female jogger, Carolin G. was also murdered.  "
Will new law stop Pakistan’s women living in fear?," (CNN) On the night of her sister’s wedding, Zuberah ran for her life. Her parents had taken to chaining her to the house by her feet, but tonight was different. The house was full of guests, and she was free to move around. While her parents were distracted, she ran into town and found a lawyer. She told him that after fleeing one abusive marriage arranged by her parents, they were forcing her to marry again.  If she refused, she believed they would kill her. Zuberah is one of 14 women living in the Dastak women’s shelter in Lahore, Pakistan. The women here say they’re being hunted by their own families.  They live in fear of becoming the next victims of an epidemic that last year claimed more than 1, 000 lives:   honor killings.  The Pakistan government has finally done something about these brutal crimes, which originate from tribal and cultural practices and are often meted out as punishment for behavior viewed as bringing dishonor to a family or village. A new law will see killers face a minimum sentence of 25 years in jail.  Previously, many murderers got off without punishment, because they were officially forgiven by the victims’ families.  Sometimes mothers forgave their sons for killing their daughters. Sometimes killers paid compensation to the victims.  Activists say it was a legal loophole that encouraged, even fed, the practice of honor killings. I pardoned my son’s killers,  Azmat Bibi pardoned her neighbors after they killed her    son Ghulam Abbas. According to police documents, a neighboring family accused her son of having a relationship with their teenage daughter Kiran.  They shot Ghulam while Azmat and her other son looked on. They also killed their own daughter Kiran. A widow, Azmat says she did not accept blood money but made the difficult choice to pardon the accused after the case against them spent two years in Pakistan’s courts. ”I have placed a rock on my heart. I have to live for my other son who is alive,” she said.  She believes her justice will come not from the legal system, but from God. The three men accused of the crime included Kiran’s father and brother. They were all released after receiving pardons from members of both families, including Kiran’s implicated father. A deterrent? Activists welcome the new law as a positive step, but warn much work remains to end the practice of   honor killings, and change the patriarchal culture that feeds it. Saba Sheikh is the head of Dastak women’s shelter. She says she hopes the law will act as a deterrent for families who are considering killing their daughters.  However, she worries that killers could still escape punishment, as the loophole is only closed for killings that are specifically classified as  . Forgiveness can still be granted in other murder cases. Sheikh also believes legal reforms must be paired with a concerted and coordinated effort to change, firstly, deeply held patriarchal beliefs in Pakistan, and secondly, a misinterpretation of the country’s religion    Islam.  ”This is not what the religion prescribes, this is not what the constitution of the country prescribes and this is something which is also against the law,” she says. Nowhere to go, Some 7, 500 women have passed through the doors of the Dastak shelter over 26 years. Dastak provides job training, childcare, and counseling, as well as a safe home for the women.  Armed guards are posted outside. Family members are encouraged to visit, both for support and mediation to try and resolve the conflicts that led the women to seek protection in the first place.   Counselor Taslim Hasan works with the women    trying to instill in them the confidence that they can make it on their own in this   society. Her message: ”You should be your own master. You should be able to do things your own. That is the only way you will survive.” The message doesn’t always sink in. Three quarters of the women here return to their families. Some women are killed after leaving the shelter. For those who want to start a new life, Dastak tries to find jobs, but it’s a challenge in a country not accustomed to the idea of single working women.  ’My daughters will marry of their own will’ Zeba, a    victim of domestic abuse, says there’s ”no way for a woman to exist” by herself in Pakistan.  She married her husband for love and her family abandoned her. Then he became abusive and she had no one to turn to. Divorce and dishonor can be deeply intertwined in Pakistan. ”If you have someone by your side, then only can you survive,” she says.  Zeba fled to Dastak with her son, still a baby, but her husband has her two young daughters. When they grow up, she doesn’t want them to face the same predicament she is in. ”When my daughters become women I will not live their lives,” said Zeba. ”They will marry out of their own will.” It’s a view born out of wanting her daughters to have a better life. If it spreads, they could also have a better country."
Veto Override Makes Missouri Newest ’Stand Your Ground’ State - Breitbart,"On September 14 Missouri’s Republican lawmakers overrode Governor Jay Nixon’s (D) veto of SB 656 and made Missouri the newest “Stand Your Ground” state. [Breitbart News previously reported that the veto override also abolished permitting requirements for   citizens who wish to exercise their Second Amendment rights by carrying handguns on their persons for  .  When SB 656 passed the legislature earlier this year the addition of a Stand Your Ground statute was a key focus. On May 13 Missouri. net reported Democrat opposition to the Stand Your Ground provision. Representative Lauren Arthur (  City) called it “a stupid, dangerous piece of legislation” and Representative Tracy Newman ( . Louis) said it would “result in the loss of life. ” But Representative Rick Brattin ( ) countered and explained that the measure was actually part of a larger attempt to ensure Missourians had “the right and ability to protect [themselves] by all means. ” Stand Your Ground provisions came under heavy scrutiny by Democrats throughout the country after George Zimmerman was acquitted in the February 26, 2012, shooting death of Trayvon Martin. Democrats seized on Florida’s Stand Your Ground law as causal in Martin’s death without noting that Zimmerman was not acquitted because of Stand Your Ground but because the jury believed his actions were an exercise of  . In addition to enacting “Stand Your Ground” and abolishing the requirement for a concealed carry permit, the override of Nixon’s veto also expands the state’s Castle Doctrine to protect babysitters and other house guests who use guns in defense of children and family members in the home. Castle Doctrine laws protect homeowners who use lethal force in protecting their lives while in their homes or on their property.

Ex-FLOTUS Michelle Obama: Trump Wants to Feed ’Crap’ to Your Kids,"  lady Michelle Obama is calling into question the “motives” of those who oppose her bland, tasteless, and universally hated school lunch rules, insisting that those who oppose her ideas don’t care about kids and don’t mind if they “eat crap. ”[Speaking at the annual Partnership for a Healthier America conference, Michelle Obama responded with venom to critics of her school lunch program.  Warming to her reply, Mrs. Obama slammed anyone who stood against her policy and characterized critics as people who don’t want kids to be healthy. Michelle Obama criticizes Trump administration’s decision on school lunch rules: “Think about why someone is OK with your kids eating crap. ” pic. twitter.   —   Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) May 12, 2017,  Saying, “This is where you have to look at motives,” Obama also hinted that she felt the only reason people opposed her nutrition rules is because people opposed her husband on a political level. “It’s not politics, it’s parenting,” she insisted. “You have to stop and think, ‘Why don’t you want our kids to have good food at school? What is wrong with you and why is that a partisan issue?” Obama said. “Why would that be political?” “Moms, think about this. I don’t care what state you live in, take me out of the equation, like me, don’t like me, but think about why someone is OK with your kids eating crap,” the former first lady continued. “Because here’s the secret: If somebody is doing that, they don’t care about your kid, and we need to demand everyone to care deeply about our kids,” Obama exclaimed. “Every elected official on this planet should understand, don’t play with our children, don’t do it,” she concluded. Nowhere in the discussion did Obama note that it is the role of parents to guide their children’s eating habits, not that of the government. In another part of her appearance, Obama ran contrary to the penchant of liberals who constantly insist that children should be given the same   power as adults. At one point, Michelle Obama claimed that kids should not have any say in the foods they eat at school. “How about we stop asking kids how they feel about their food? Kids, my kids included, if they could eat pizza and french fries every day with ice cream on top and a soda, they would think they were happy until they got sick,” she said during the session. “That to me is one of the most ridiculous things we talk about in this movement, that the kids aren’t happy. Well, you know what? Kids don’t like math, either. So what are we going to do, stop teaching math? We gonna cut history out because there are kids who are bored with history? We are the adults in the room, you know? They look to us. So let’s just stop with that. I’m good if kids are mad at me,” she concluded. Obama is unhappy that the Trump administration has begun the process of rolling back the unappetizing food restrictions the former first lady put into place during her husband’s tenure in the White House. Late last month, U. S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue began easing some of the restrictions Obama worked to enforce in school lunch programs throughout the country. Perdue put in place an interim rule for the   school year that suspended Obama’s requirements for sodium reduction and whole grains. The new rules also once again permitted   flavored milk in school cafeterias. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com."

Congressional caucus to present report on missing black girls,"Washington (CNN) A congressional caucus founded by three   women plans to present a report by the end of the year on how to solve the problem of missing black children nationwide. ”We don’t want to just talk about the problems, we want to think about the solutions,” Rep. Robin Kelly said Wednesday at a town hall on the issue.  The Congressional Caucus on Black Women and Girls hosted a town hall at the Library of Congress Wednesday to address what they characterize as a national epidemic of missing black children. The group, founded by Kelly, Rep. Yvette Clarke and Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman in 2016, consists of more than 20 lawmakers working toward solutions to challenges impacting black women and girls. The town hall came amid calls for federal assistance to help locate missing   girls whose profiles are posted almost daily on the Washington Metropolitan Police Department’s Twitter feed. In 2014, the Black and Missing Foundation reported that 64, 000 black women and girls were missing nationwide. But activists, law enforcement officials and political leaders at the town hall said media coverage and legislation does not reflect that reality. After hearing the data, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said it is ”such an injustice” that women and girls of color are more likely to go missing.  ”I feel like knocking on every attic, every garage to see where those girls are,” she said. ”Let’s be an example to the world that we can’t rest until these girls are found.” Panelists wanted to dispel the idea that all missing black girls are runaways from challenging backgrounds involved in illicit activities and said any young person who is active on social media can find themselves at risk of being abducted. ”There are parks. There are malls. There are recreation centers,” said Stephanie Cooney, a legal fellow with the Black Women’s Health Imperative, a   health organization. ”Traffickers know where minors frequent. They know where to meet them. They know where to talk to them. They can very well be your community members.” The event’s speakers said Congress needs to provide resources so that multiple agencies    police departments, health care institutions, courts and social services    can better collaborate to find missing girls. ”We have not trained a lot of agencies to recognize the signs of trafficking,” said Kisha   a juvenile probation officer for Cook County. ”They criminalize certain behaviors.” ”We miss so many young ladies that are being exploited because we don’t see   girls as victims, we see them as misbehaving,” she added. Caucus members responded pledging to advocate for more funding, housing and training to aid those on the ground responding to the issue. ”Somebody’s got to work in this space,” Coleman told panelists. ”I tell you, we are ready wiling and able. We will be whatever kind of motivation or impetus that is needed.”"
"Sheldon Silver, Ex-New York Assembly Speaker, Gets 12-Year Prison Sentence - The New York Times","Sheldon Silver, who rose from the Lower East Side of Manhattan to become one of the state’s most powerful and feared politicians as speaker of the New York Assembly, was sentenced on Tuesday to 12 years in prison in a case that came to symbolize Albany’s culture of graft. The conviction of Mr. Silver, 72, served as a capstone to a campaign against public corruption by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, which has led to more than a dozen state lawmakers’ being convicted or pleading guilty. But none had the power, cachet or longevity that Mr. Silver, a Democrat, had enjoyed, and prosecutors sought to make an example of him. They asked that he receive a sentence greater than the terms that had been “imposed on other New York State legislators convicted of public corruption offenses. ” The longest such sentence cited by the government was 14 years, the term imposed last year in the case of another former Democratic assemblyman, William F. Boyland Jr. who was tried and convicted in federal court in Brooklyn. Judge Valerie E. Caproni of Federal District Court in Manhattan noted that even before Mr. Silver’s arrest, when some of his fellow legislators had been arrested on corruption charges, he remained undeterred. “One would think that the image of Mr. Silver’s colleagues being arrested and led off to jail would have caused someone who was basically honest to reappraise what was going on,” Judge Caproni said. Instead, she said, Mr. Silver “stopped nothing,” continuing to lie to his staff and to the press while holding himself out as “a paragon of virtue. ” Judge Caproni said that there had been an “incalculable, intangible harm” to the people of New York, and that the cumulative effect of public corruption “makes the public very cynical. ” She then listed some of Mr. Silver’s misdeeds and addressed him directly: “Mr. Silver, those are not the actions of a basically honest person. ” In court, Carrie H. Cohen, an assistant United States attorney, had asked that Mr. Silver’s sentence “reflect the massive damage caused to the public by his crimes. ” The sentence, Ms. Cohen continued, should send a message that this is not the way “business is done in Albany, or at least that it shouldn’t be, and that no one, including Sheldon Silver, is above the law. ” Mr. Silver briefly addressed the court before his sentence was delivered, saying he had let down his constituents, family and colleagues. “I’m truly, truly sorry for that,” he said. Mr. Silver was convicted on Nov. 30 of charges that included honest services fraud, money laundering and extortion. Upon his conviction, he forfeited his Assembly seat. Two weeks later, Dean G. Skelos, who as majority leader had been Mr. Silver’s Republican counterpart in the State Senate, was also convicted of corruption. Mr. Skelos is to be sentenced on May 12 a week later, John L. Sampson, a former leader of the Senate Democrats, will face his own sentencing. Prosecutors’ scrutiny of New York lawmakers continues: Several inquiries are now focused on possible wrongdoing connected to the administrations of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, both Democrats. To date, however, Mr. Silver’s precipitous fall has no recent rival in the world of New York politics. In a statement issued moments after the sentencing, Mr. Bharara said that the “stiff sentence is a just and fitting end to Sheldon Silver’s long career of corruption. ” Mr. Silver had served for more than two decades as the Assembly speaker, imposing his will on matters large and small he had a reputation as a staunch defender of New York City, a shrewd negotiator in budget talks and, at times, a recalcitrant opponent of anything he disliked. But during a   trial last fall, a different side of Mr. Silver emerged. Evidence showed that he had obtained nearly $4 million in illicit fees in return for taking official actions that benefited a prominent cancer researcher, Dr. Robert N. Taub, at Columbia University, and two real estate developers, Glenwood Management and the Witkoff Group. Mr. Silver had expressed regret that his actions made the State Capitol the object of ridicule. In a letter sent last month to Judge Caproni, he offered an emotional apology, saying that he had “failed the people of New York. ” His lawyers had argued that the former speaker should be allowed to use his “unique talents” to benefit others, and that a sentence that incorporates “extensive community service and little  —   if any  —   incarceration could do that. ” Mr. Silver’s lawyers had suggested that he could work with the Fortune Society to help current and former inmates find jobs. One of Mr. Silver’s lawyers, Joel Cohen, told the judge that his client had been “devastated” and “crushed” by everything that had happened. Notwithstanding everything he has done, Mr. Cohen said, “his obituary has already been written. ” Another prosecutor, Howard S. Master, on Tuesday questioned the authenticity of Mr. Silver’s contrition, noting he had insisted that he would be exonerated “until the very moment of the jury’s verdict. ” Judge Caproni, citing Mr. Silver’s age, said she would not adhere to sentencing guidelines that recommended a term of roughly 22 to 27 years, calling such a sentence “draconian and unjust. ” The court’s probation office had recommended a   sentence. The judge ordered that Mr. Silver forfeit more than $5 million in proceeds from his crimes and pay a $1. 75 million fine. She rejected a defense assertion that Mr. Silver’s actions had not caused “discernible harm. ” She said the specter of corruption made it impossible to know whether government officials were making decisions for the right reasons or for personal financial gain. His crimes “cast a shadow over everything he has done and has thrown into doubt every difficult decision any legislator has ever made,” the judge said. Mr. Silver must surrender himself by noon on July 1 his lawyers have requested that he serve at the Federal Correctional Institution in Otisville, N. Y. a prison known for its familiarity with the housing of prisoners who, like Mr. Silver, are Orthodox Jews. Governor Cuomo said on Tuesday: “Today’s decision sent a simple message that officials who abuse the public’s trust will be held accountable. Justice was served. ” Last month, prosecutors, in a written submission to the judge, offered what they said was additional evidence of the ways Mr. Silver had abused his office “for personal benefit,” by helping two women with whom he had conducted extramarital affairs. One of the women had regularly lobbied Mr. Silver on behalf of clients with business before the state he had “used his official position,” prosecutors said, to help the other woman get a state job. Mr. Silver’s lawyers said after the hearing that his case would be appealed. Mr. Silver, addressing a crowd of reporters, said, “I believe in the justice system in this nation, and we’ll pursue whatever remedies the system makes available. ”"
White House Sidesteps Hillary Clinton’s Abortion Comments - Breitbart,"The White House avoided questions about President Obama’s position on constitutional rights for unborn persons, after Hillary Clinton’s controversial comments on the subject. [During a conversation on NBC’s Meet the Press, Clinton was asked about the subject by host Chuck Todd:  TODD: When or if does an unborn child have constitutional rights? CLINTON: Well, under our laws currently, that is not something that exists. The unborn person doesn’t have constitutional rights. During the White House press briefing, press Secretary Josh Earnest was questioned by Breitbart News if the president agreed with Clinton’s view. But Earnest steered away from the controversial topic, reminding reporters that Obama supported “a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions. ” He added that he had not seen Clinton’s remarks, which caused controversy from both   and   activists. In 2008,   candidate Obama was asked a similar question about personhood within the womb during a forum with Pastor Rick Warren of the Saddleback Church. Pastor Warren: I know this is a very complex issue. Forty million abortions, at what point does a baby get human rights, in your view? Obama: Well, you know, I think that whether you’re looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective, answering that question with specificity, you know, is above my pay grade. It appears that the topic is still above Obama’s pay grade, even though he has been the president for seven years. The White House cited the president’s 2008 remarks in response to a followup with their press office."
"Offices of Volkswagen and Audi Chiefs Searched in Raid, Warrant Says - The New York Times","FRANKFURT  —   German officials included the offices of both Volkswagen’s chief executive and the head of the Audi division when they raided company premises last week as part of an investigation into emissions fraud, according to a copy of the search warrant. The warrant, whose contents were viewed by The New York Times, was first reported on Sunday by the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag. It does not identify Matthias Müller, Volkswagen’s chief executive, or Rupert Stadler, head of the Audi luxury car division, as suspects in the case. Investigators do not yet have enough evidence to determine who is responsible for illegally manipulating diesel motor software to deceive American   regulators, according to the warrant. But the warrant, signed by a judge in Munich, allowed investigators to seize documents and other items such as appointment calendars, copies of emails, mobile phones and electronic passwords from Mr. Müller and Mr. Stadler, and numerous other current or past Volkswagen and Audi employees. The   document portrays a much broader investigation than was previously known. It indicates that Volkswagen is far from dealing with the consequences of its emissions cheating a year and a half after it was first exposed. Volkswagen and Audi face a host of problems, including slipping market share in Europe and China, and can ill afford any further damage to their reputations. The warrant, used by Munich prosecutors as part of an investigation that focuses on Audi’s role in the scandal, allowed officials to search company departments including sales, marketing, personnel, engine development and legal compliance, along with the executive offices. The document, which also included a map of Audi headquarters in Ingolstadt, Germany, names 47 people whose property is subject to seizure, including Mr. Müller and Mr. Stadler. Eric Felber, a Volkswagen spokesman, said the company was cooperating fully with investigators and declined to comment further. Mr. Müller said last week that no current member of the Volkswagen management board, a group that includes Mr. Stadler, was involved in any wrongdoing. Volkswagen has had to continually retreat from its initial assertion in 2015 that the deception was the work of a handful of rogue engineers. Volkswagen pleaded guilty in a Detroit court this month to charges that included conspiracy to violate the Clean Air Act. While maintaining that no members of the management board took part, Volkswagen acknowledged that the fraud involved numerous employees and departments. In a statement of facts, Volkswagen said that its employees programmed pollution control equipment in diesel cars to operate at a reduced level except when software detected that an emissions test was underway. As a result, the cars spewed excess amounts of nitrogen oxides, which can cause respiratory diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. The fraud reached from company headquarters in Wolfsburg to Volkswagen offices in the United States, and included employees in engine development, quality control and emissions compliance, the company admitted. Volkswagen also conceded that, when it became clear that United States regulators were about to uncover the fraud,   lawyers encouraged other employees to destroy evidence. There have been previous indications that the scandal extended to Volkswagen’s top ranks. German prosecutors have said that they consider Martin Winterkorn, the former chief executive, a suspect. They have also said they are investigating Hans Dieter Pötsch, the chairman of the supervisory board, on suspicion of violating securities laws by failing to inform shareholders as soon as he should have about risks from the diesel deception. Mr. Winterkorn has said he was not aware of the illegal software until September 2015, shortly before the wrongdoing became public. Mr. Pötsch has said that he fulfilled his duties under German stock market laws. Prosecutors in Munich have been concentrating on Audi’s role in the scandal while authorities in Braunschweig, near Volkswagen’s headquarters in Wolfsburg, have taken the lead in investigating the parent company. Ingolstadt, home of Audi’s flagship plant, is about 50 miles north of Munich. The Munich investigation had attracted only modest attention until Wednesday, when officials appeared at Audi headquarters early in the morning with the search warrant and began taking possession of documents. Media coverage since then has cast an unwelcome spotlight on one of Volkswagen’s most important sources of profit. Mr. Müller, 63, spent most of his career at Audi, rising to become head of product management before being named chief executive of Volkswagen’s Porsche division in 2010. He became chief executive of Volkswagen in September 2015 after Mr. Winterkorn resigned in the aftermath of the scandal. In addition to being chief executive, Mr. Müller is chairman of Audi’s supervisory board. Mr. Stadler, 54, has been chief executive of Audi since 2007, and a member of the Volkswagen management board since 2010. The Munich search warrant provided further detail about the engineering problems that led Audi employees to cheat in the first place, setting the stage for one of the biggest corporate scandals in automobile history. Audi has agreed to pay $1. 2 billion to settle a consumer fraud lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission involving about 80, 000 vehicles with diesel motors. That is part of more than $22 billion that Volkswagen is paying in settlements and fines. The deception at Audi originated in 2005 when the division first decided to begin marketing cars with diesel motors in the United States, according to the warrant. The cars came with equipment that used a spray of urea solution to neutralize nitrogen oxides. But Audi engineers soon realized that the holding tanks in the cars could not hold enough of the urea fluid to last between regular   service intervals, while still meeting the United States’ stricter limits on nitrogen oxides. Fearful that extra maintenance chores would turn off buyers, the engineers devised software that reduced consumption of the fluid, except when the software detected that the car was being tested on rollers in a lab. The software, known as a defeat device, was “designed so that substantial reduction of emissions functioned only on the roller test bed,” the warrant said. According to the warrant, investigators are still trying to determine who “took initiative for this development, which levels of company hierarchy were informed, and what level made the decision to mass produce the defeat device. ”"
Paul says ’over half’ on disability are gaming the system,"Washington (CNN) Democrats blasted Sen. Rand Paul on Wednesday for arguing that a majority of people collecting Social Security disability benefits are taking advantage of the system.  Speaking at a New Hampshire diner about government waste, the Kentucky Republican said ”there’s always somebody who’s deserving” of entitlement programs, ”But everybody in this room knows somebody who’s gaming the system.” In full 2016 mode, Rand Paul starts New Hampshire blitz, ”What I tell people is, if you look like me and you hop out of your truck, you shouldn’t be getting a disability check. Over half of the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts    join the club,” he said, drawing a few laughs from the audience. ”Who doesn’t get a little anxious for work everyday and their back hurts? Everybody over 40 has back pain.” Paul qualified his comments, saying there are people who are legitimately disabled but reiterated that there are also ”malingers” who are essentially taking money ”from the people who are paraplegic, quadriplegic.” ”We all know people who are horrifically disabled and can’t work, but if you have   people taking the money then there’s not enough money left for the people who are truly disabled,” he added.  Ray Buckley, chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, was quick to pounce on his comments, saying in a call with reporters that the remark was ”ridiculously reminiscent” of Mitt Romney’s controversial argument in 2012 that nearly half of Americans back Obama because they rely on government support. Buckley acknowledged that there is fraud in the system but argued that Paul’s estimation that more than half of beneficiaries shouldn’t qualify was ”way out of nowhere” and a ”detachment from reality.”  According to a December 2014 report from the Social Security Administration, 14% of those who were issued disability benefits were diagnosed with ”mood disorders,” while 28% reported ”musculoskeletal system and connective tissue” diseases, which would be related to back problems.  What’s happening in 2016: Romney and everyone else, Critics argue that the list of ailments covered by disability benefits is bloated and far too easy to take advantage of, resulting in millions of dollars in  .  Proponents say there are strict standards in place to approve applicants. According to a 2013 SSA report, denied disability claims have averaged 59% from  .  Asked to respond to Democratic attacks, Paul later reiterated that the government ”should take care of those truly in need of help” but stressed that the ”system is broken.” ”We absolutely should take care of those truly in need of help,” he said in a statement to CNN, responding to a request for a response to Democratic attacks. ”But the system is broken, and when people can game the system, they are stealing from those who are truly disabled and won’t receive the care and aid they need. We must reform the system to ensure that those who really need help receive it.”"
"Russia, Suspected in Hacking, Has Uneasy History With Hillary Clinton - The New York Times","PHILADELPHIA  —   Follow along with our coverage of the Democratic National Convention. Donald J. Trump’s apparent endorsement on Wednesday of Russian cyberspying against Hillary Clinton has pulled President Vladimir V. Putin fully into the American political fray. But Mr. Putin’s relationship with Mrs. Clinton has been tense at least since 2011, when, as secretary of state, she accused him of rigging an election and he accused her of meddling in Russian politics. Mr. Putin  —   who was then the prime minister, plotting his return to the presidency  —   said her words were a “signal” to protesters, encouraging them to take to the streets, which they did in large numbers. Her remarks also annoyed the White House, which at that time still clung to the hope that President Obama’s policy of “resetting” relations with Russia could be salvaged. That episode, late in Mrs. Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, is important to understanding why Mr. Putin’s government could have a motive for hacking into the Democratic National Committee’s computers and leaking emails to damage her electoral prospects against Mr. Trump. But it also speaks to the   stance toward Russia and Mr. Putin that Mrs. Clinton staked out in the Obama administration. At the same time that she was condemning Russia over its elections, Mr. Obama’s national security adviser, Tom Donilon, was planning to travel to Moscow to meet Mr. Putin her harsh words complicated his diplomacy. Above all, the bitter exchange attests to a combustible relationship between two ambitious,   leaders, both unafraid to exercise power  —   one a former K. G. B. officer who emerged from the shadows the other a famous female politician who spent decades on the public stage. “In our administration, Secretary Clinton always had a tougher line toward Putin and the Russians than other senior administration officials,” said Michael A. McFaul, an adviser on Russia who served as United States ambassador to Moscow. “It was Putin’s strong belief that we, with Clinton in the lead, were trying to meddle with his regime. ” It was one of several instances where Mrs. Clinton was more hawkish than her boss  —   differences the White House and the Clinton campaign have so far played down but which may loom larger in the general election. Certainly, Mrs. Clinton has been open in saying she would push back harder than Mr. Obama has against Mr. Putin’s aggression in Ukraine and Syria. Mrs. Clinton’s first meeting with Mr. Putin as secretary of state set the stage for a stormy relationship. When she went to see him in his dacha outside Moscow on March 19, 2010, he kept her waiting in front of a ceramic mantelpiece, facing a forest of cameras and boom microphones. Mr. Putin finally turned up for what was billed as a brief photo opportunity, only to lecture her in front of the reporters about how the United States needed to lift sanctions against American companies doing business in Iran. And when Mrs. Clinton started to defend the Obama administration’s policy, he promptly ordered the news media out of the room. Mrs. Clinton laughed off the episode, telling reporters what has become an   story about their relationship. “Prime Minister Putin,” she recalled asking him amid his harangue about trade policy, “tell me about what you’re doing to save the tigers in Siberia. ” Eyes brightening, Mr. Putin motioned her to his private office downstairs, where he showed her a map of Russia. Pointing to various regions, he delivered a fervent lecture about endangered tigers and polar bears. He asked her whether Bill Clinton would go on a   expedition with him in Siberia. If Bill was not available, he said, maybe Hillary would go? Diplomats traveling with her were impressed. “It’s like he sizes somebody up and sees them as a worthy adversary or counterpart,” said William J. Burns, a former ambassador to Moscow who served as Mrs. Clinton’s deputy at the State Department. “I’ve seen him with other people who he didn’t see that way, and he’d be much more dismissive and snarky. ” In retrospect, though, the meeting planted the seeds for future tensions. Eight months later, Mrs. Clinton canceled her attendance at a meeting he organized in St. Petersburg to save the tigers. Her excuse was that she had to stay in Washington to lobby the Senate to ratify a new arms reduction treaty. A year later, Mrs. Clinton was traveling in Lithuania when reports of ballot tampering and other fraud emerged after parliamentary elections in Russia. “The Russian people, like people everywhere, deserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted,” she said in a statement, drafted by her spokeswoman, Victoria J. Nuland, a career diplomat and Soviet expert known for her   views about Russia. “Putin was livid that she had spoken out,” Mr. McFaul said.   Russian officials even called the White House to ask whether she was speaking for the United States. That created a tempest in the West Wing, since Mr. McFaul had signed off on Mrs. Clinton’s statement. Although the president was also skeptical of Mr. Putin’s intentions, he, too, had hoped to keep the reset policy alive a little longer. There was no evidence that Mrs. Clinton had any regrets. Shortly before she left the State Department, she asked her top policy aide, Jake Sullivan, to draft a      exit memo from her to Mr. Obama, warning him that the reset policy was dead, that relations with Russia would deteriorate under Mr. Putin and that the United States needed to push back hard. Advisers to Mrs. Clinton said they were confident she would pursue such a strategy as president. Mr. Trump’s latest comments  —   in which he said he hoped Russia would find and expose thousands of emails that Mrs. Clinton did not hand over to the State Department  —   only highlighted the chasm between their positions, according to these aides. “What Trump said today is reckless and demonstrates he is unfit for the Oval Office,” said R. Nicholas Burns, a former top State Department official and   adviser to Mrs. Clinton. He said that he was confident that Mrs. Clinton would strongly defend the interests of the United States and its allies against any aggression by Mr. Putin. By 2014, after Russia had annexed Crimea and sent its tanks and troops to menace Ukraine, Mrs. Clinton’s exit memo to the president looked prescient. Speaking at a Democratic   in California in March 2014, she likened Mr. Putin’s behavior to Hitler’s conquest of the Sudetenland in 1938. When Mr. Putin was asked about that comparison by a French television station three months later, he replied: “It’s better not to argue with women. Ms. Clinton had never been too graceful in her statements. ”"
Reince Priebus with Trump: ’Don’t Believe the Garbage you Read’,"Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairman Reince Priebus fired up more than 7, 000 people before introducing Donald Trump at his campaign rally in Erie, Pennsylvania on Friday afternoon, showing the Republican Party is united behind its nominee. [“We’re so honored to be working with Donald Trump and the campaign,” he told the packed crowd inside the Erie Insurance Arena, saying the eight to nine thousand gathered to hear Trump was “unbelievable. ”  “We just had a great poll that came out,” he touted, referencing a new LA Times poll that shows Hillary Clinton and Trump neck and neck, adding that it’s a “tied election in spite of the biased media. ” “Don’t believe the garbage you read,” he added. “Donald Trump, the Republican Party, all of you  —   we’re going to put him in the White House and save this country together!” Priebus’s appearance comes as reports surfaced that dozens of Republicans are asking the RNC to stop funding Trump’s campaign and focus on down ticket candidates after recent polls suggested Clinton was catching Trump in states that are usually Republican strongholds such as Georgia and Utah. “We’re in a battle for freedom,” Priebus proclaimed about the election. “Look at the choice we’ve got  …    Hillary Clinton has a problem with lying. ” “She lied, she lied, and she lied over and over and over again,” he declared. “She lied when she said she turned over those work related emails. She lied when she said that nothing in these emails were confidential. She lied when she said that she only had one device. ” The crowd started chanting “lock her up” in response. “Lets do this, lets beat her in November, ok?” Priebus replied. “Here’s the difference  —   Donald Trump and Mike Pence will tell the truth!” Trump piggy backed off of Priebus’s criticism of Clinton and the “biased media” when he took the stage. “Our government is for sale by a crooked person and what they’re doing is they’re trying to not talk about her,” Trump commented on the recent emails revealing a relationship between Clinton’s State Department and The Clinton Foundation and how the media hasn’t covered it in detail.  “You go to CNN, as an example, story after story about Trump. ” “These people are the lowest form of life,” he added of media and pundits. Trump also knocked Clinton for admitting she   an answer regarding the FBI investigation into her email scandal. “I don’t want a president that ” Trump jabbed."

Known as “Espacio Escultórico” (“Sculptural Space”) the sculpture was inaugurated in 1979 here on the campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. It is considered one of the most important pieces of land art in Mexico, a tranquil oasis in a chaotic city. But the recent construction of a white   building nearby has prompted a furious protest that pits the university’s needs against Mexico’s cultural heritage. The campaign against the building, which looms over the   pyramids from less than a   away, has drawn hundreds of artists, architects and intellectuals from Mexico and beyond. A change. org petition to protect the work has gathered more than 30, 000 signatures. Prominent cultural figures, including the writer Elena Poniatowska, have published letters in the press or posted video statements on Facebook defending the sculpture about 300 students and faculty members of the university’s architecture school signed a letter to the head of the department in April calling for the building to be modified or demolished. For the artists, the building, which belongs to the social science faculty, ruins the line of the sky against the flat tops of the pyramids. “All the great works of land art  —   the horizon is how they function,” the artist Anish Kapoor said in an interview at the site last week. Anything that intrudes on the art, he said, “takes away some of the poetic, unnameable qualities of the work. ” About two dozen artists have said they would be willing to auction works to pay to move the building  —   among them Mr. Kapoor, a show of whose work opened at the University Museum of Contemporary Art here on Saturday. “You can’t move the lava. You can’t move the landscape,” said Pedro Reyes, a sculptor who is leading the campaign to dismantle Building H, as it is known. “So you have to move the building. ” Some students raised concerns last year about several construction projects on campus, including Building H, but it was not until Mr. Reyes visited the sculpture in February that he saw the finished building and began campaigning. Much land art, in which the landscape is integral to the work, is remote and can be huge, such as Robert Smithson’s “Spiral Jetty,” on the shore of Great Salt Lake in Utah, and Michael Heizer’s vast, unfinished sculpture “City,” in the Nevada desert. Patricia Martín, an independent curator in Mexico City, said Building H was typical of rampant Mexican construction where “people do not make the effort to think” what the impact will be. The ruckus “raises a public debate about how to think about space, how to think about art, how a building looks,” she said, adding, “That is healthy. ” But the university says it will not destroy a building that it paid over a $1 million for and that is being used for classes and research. Marcos Mazari Hiriart, director of the architecture faculty, said the construction was a “mistake” and had “damaged” the horizon of “Espacio Escultórico. ” But the problem could be remedied by camouflaging the building, not demolishing it, he said. Besides, Mr. Mazari said, the artwork, which stands in a nearly   ecological reserve that occupies a third of the university campus, was not intended to be protected in perpetuity from intrusion by other construction. “Is it urban art or land art?” he said. Arguing that the land around the work only became a reserve  —   and a serendipitous buffer  —   a few years after the sculpture was made, he said, “It became land art over time. ” Building H does not break any regulations, said Sergio Boeta Angeles, a lawyer in Mexico City who specializes in cultural heritage. “There is no legal basis for not building it,” he said. “It’s a moral question. ” The sculpture was a collaboration among six Mexican artists: Helen Escobedo Manuel Felguérez Mathias Goeritz Manuel Hernández Suárez, known as Hersúa Federico Silva and Enrique Carbajal, known as Sebastián. Its centerpiece is a naturally formed, jagged mound of    lava rock that seems still to be bubbling from the earth. Around that stand the pyramids, evenly spaced with a slightly wider gap at the four cardinal points. The work is surrounded by scrubland filled with indigenous plants. Building H is not the only construction that is visible, but it is taller than most and on higher ground. In a city struggling with violence, pollution and chaotic planning, a fuss over one building could seem trivial, Mr. Reyes said. But it is all the more reason to respect the sculpture, he said. “Mexico needs peace,” he said. “This is the most peaceful place in Mexico City. ” Allowing the building to stay would set a poor precedent, some said. “If they leave that building there, who knows what else they’ll build,” said Cesar Cervantes, 27, a geography student who was sitting on the edge of the circle last week. Mr. Mazari said that the university would hold a workshop this month to discuss remedies for Building H  —   painting it blue, growing plants over it, planting trees to hide it, covering it with mirrors. The university has formed a committee to monitor campus construction, he said. But the building’s opponents insist the building must go, or its top few floors should be removed so it is no longer visible from the sculpture, a remedy Mr. Mazari calls impractical. If money is the main obstacle, the artists say, they will foot the bill. “Works like this represent what can be done,” Mr. Kapoor said. “They must be looked after. ” The fight against the building was “a battle for the poetic spirit of the work,” he said, adding, “We lose that in our culture, we lose everything. ”"
Model for ’Rosie the Riveter’ dies at 92," (CNN) As the model for Norman Rockwell’s ”Rosie the Riveter,” Mary Doyle Keefe became the symbol of American women working on the home front during World War II. The    died this week at her home in Simsbury, Connecticut. As a    telephone operator, Keefe posed for the famous painting that would become the cover of the Saturday Evening Post on May 29, 1943. Although she was petite, Keefe was transformed into the iconic    and burly    embodiment of the character by Rockwell. ”Other than the red hair and my face, Norman Rockwell embellished Rosie’s body,” Keefe said in a 2012 interview with the Hartford Courant. ”I was much smaller than that and did not know how he was going to make me look like that until I saw the finished painting.” People we’ve lost in 2015, Keefe pocketed $10 for the two mornings of modeling work she did in Arlington, Vermont. Rockwell lived in neighboring West Arlington at the time. ”Rosie the Riveter” is often confused with another popular image from the same era. The poster shows a woman flexing her arm under the slogan ”We Can Do It.” It was part of a nationwide campaign to sell war bonds, but is not the same character. Still, many folks on social media paid tribute to Keefe using the image. Both show the key role women played in the war effort."
"Now the European Union Wants ""Build A Wall"" – With Russia","Lithuanian Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis has taken a leaf out of   Donald J. Trump’s book, announcing a   euro border fence to “ensure credible control of [the] eastern border of the European Union”. [EurActiv reports that the €30 million project will be funded largely from the European Union (EU) budget, to which the UK contributes a net £200 million every week.  Skvernelis claims the fence, which will be erected against the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, will “first of all, ensure our economic security” while “also solving issues when it comes to illegal migration”. Far from being disappointed by the project, Russian state media reports Kaliningrad’s governor as being eager to secure contracts for the building materials which the   project will require. The Baltic republic is not a popular destination for migrants, with asylum seekers resettled there from camps in Greece and Turkey complaining that state benefits are not so generous as in Germany or Sweden and attempting to escape to wealthier EU members. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaitė has predicted an increase in the number of migrants taking alternative routes into western Europe now that the EU signed a controversial six billion euro deal to stem the flow from Turkey. The Turkey deal has been a partial success in terms of reducing overall numbers, but the transfer arrangements it included have seen more than three times as many migrants forwarded to the EU as have been returned to Turkey, and the Turkish president looks set to terminate it if his own EU membership bid is not accelerated. “One should not be afraid to say that Europe has to be closed, at least temporarily, especially for economic migrants,” Grybauskaitė told broadcaster LRT. “The protection of the EU’s external borders should be the European solution. ” Lithuania’s announcement on the fence comes as the United States’s incoming president denounced the migrant crisis as a “catastrophic mistake” on the part of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, congratulating the British public on their decision to leave an EU which he sums up as “basically a vehicle for Germany”. Prior to Trump’s election victory, Merkel’s foreign minister commented that “building walls is a very bad idea  —   no matter who pays for them”."
Proposed Football League Envisions a No-College Path to the Pros - The New York Times,"The sports landscape is littered with failed professional football leagues, such is the dominance of the N. F. L. Yet the sports agent Don Yee, who represents New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, thinks he may have found a model that will work: a league for   to    players who skip college to play professionally right away. Most fledgling leagues, like the defunct U. F. L. or the X. F. L. had rosters filled with castoffs who had gone undrafted out of college or who had bounced around pro teams. The quality of play was uneven, while games often overlapped with the N. F. L. and N. C. A. A. calendars, making it hard to gain attention. Yee and his investment group see their new Pacific Pro Football league, which is expected to start in summer 2018, as more of a development league filled with players who want to immediately start playing a   game while getting a paycheck, rather than risking injury on a college team and receiving no compensation. “Most other leagues usually took players who were deemed not good enough for the N. F. L. ,” Yee said. “We’re now trying to go to the head of the line at the buffet instead of getting the   ones. ” Despite the long odds of success, Yee is not the only person trying to get a football league off the ground. In April, a new spring league will roll out in West Virginia, where players “who may have been overlooked by the N. F. L. C. F. L. and other professional leagues” can pay $350 to showcase their talents in a   season, the league’s website says. The N. F. L. also has toyed with starting a developmental league. In October, Commissioner Roger Goodell said the team owners had discussed the idea of working with 300 to 400 players to make them “ready to play as quickly as possible,” though nothing concrete emerged from the discussions. Other leagues already employ teenagers who skip college. Major League Baseball clubs draft young players and send them to their academies or minor league affiliates. Many N. H. L. teams have players as young as 18 on their rosters. Players can join N. B. A. teams if they are 19 and a year removed from high school. (In 2001, the N. B. A. started its own development league, where the players can be 18.) N. F. L. teams can draft only players who are three years removed from their high school class’s graduation, a rule the league said is intended to protect younger, less physically developed players. “The physical, mental and emotional demands of our sport would make it almost impossible for someone to have success in the N. F. L. at an earlier age,” said Brian McCarthy, a league spokesman. Richard Lapchick, the director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, or Tides, said that the N. F. L. had an incentive not to undercut college football, which he said was a “great feeder system. ” Even with an alternate league, college football, where players get scholarships but are not paid, would remain a strong draw for high school players because of the potential exposure, he said. He added that requiring athletes to spend more time in college makes it more likely that they will be prepared for life in the N. F. L. and after they retire from the game. “I don’t know how broad the interest in academic development is by the pro leagues, but someone who has a broader range of interests has a more balanced life and has the potential to be a better athlete,” he said. Yee acknowledged that his venture was risky, something his advisers have echoed. Fans already have a lot of options for watching college and professional football, and just paying for the necessary training facilities and transportation could be enough to bankrupt a new league. “I’ve danced with at least three of these groups before, but money was always what killed them,” said Jim Steeg, who is an unpaid adviser to Yee and ran the Super Bowl for the N. F. L. for decades. Steeg estimated that between $5 million and $7 million would be needed to cover the costs of each team for one season, along with a comparable sum to run the league office. Still, Steeg was encouraged that Yee was starting small and aiming for a unique pool of players, and that he had already received funding from an “angel” investor. Yee said he hoped to attract enough money in the next phase of   to cover the cost of a first season. The league would have four teams based in Southern California, both to reduce expenses and because the region has so many young players. The league would have a   schedule plus playoffs, and finish before the college season begins. Players would be paid an average of $50, 000 in salary and benefits, including workers’ compensation, a 401( k) plan and free community college tuition. Yee wants to partner with companies in the area to create internships for the players to prepare them for when their football days are over. In addition to Steeg, Yee said he was being advised by, among others, the former N. F. L. coach Mike Shanahan Mike Pereira, who was in charge of officiating for the N. F. L. and the ESPN analyst Adam Schefter. Ed McCaffrey, a former Denver Broncos wide receiver, is a  . Having enough money to get a league off the ground is one challenge. Finding a way to publicize it is another. With television already cluttered with dozens of games each week, the chances of a new league finding space on a widely distributed cable network are remote. Yee said that internet giants like Amazon and Netflix were looking for sports content to distribute. It is far from clear, however, whether one of those companies will pay Yee’s league to show games."
"Genetic Heart Disease Risk Eased by Healthy Habits, Study Finds - The New York Times","Is genetics destiny when it comes to heart disease? A new analysis of data from more than 55, 000 people provides an answer. It finds that by living right  —   by not smoking, by exercising moderately and by eating a healthy diet heavy in fruits, vegetables and grains  —   people can tamp down even the worst genetic risk. “DNA is not destiny it is not deterministic for this disease,” said Dr. Sekar Kathiresan, the director of the Center for Human Genetic Research at Massachusetts General Hospital. “You do have control over the problem, even if you have been dealt a bad genetic hand. ” The research, by Dr. Kathiresan and his colleagues, is the first attempt to use large data sets to tease apart the effects of genes and lifestyle in heart disease, researchers said. It was published on Sunday in The New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with the presentation of the results at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association. About 365, 000 people die of coronary heart disease  —   the most common type  —   annually in the United States, and 17. 3 million worldwide, making it one of the biggest killers. The investigators found that genes can double the risk of heart disease, but a good lifestyle cuts it in half. Just as important, they found, a terrible lifestyle erases about half of the benefits of good genetics. Dr. Michael Lauer, a cardiologist who is the deputy director for extramural research at the National Institutes of Health and was not involved in the analysis, called the study impressive. Its subjects were from four large studies, yet the results were consistent and convincing, even though the populations were quite varied. That sort of research, he said, “is not something we see very often, and certainly not with this degree of rigor. ” One study the group analyzed involved black and white Americans aged 45 to 64. A good lifestyle in those with the highest genetic risk cut the   likelihood of heart disease to 5. 1 percent from 10. 7 percent. Another study involved 21, 222 American women aged 45 and older who were health professionals their   risk fell to 2 percent from 4. 6 percent in the   group if they also had a healthy lifestyle. In a third study, Swedish participants aged 44 to 73 had a   risk reduction to 5. 3 percent from 8. 2 percent. And finally, in a study of Americans aged 55 to 80, those with genetic risk but a healthy lifestyle had significantly less calcium, a sign of heart disease, in their coronary arteries. Dr. Lauer also was encouraged by the finding that the fourth study, which used imaging, showed the same pattern as the others that used heart attacks and other signs of heart disease as endpoints. “That gives us more confidence that the findings are real,” he said. The results, he said, should quell the cries of both those who emphasize genes above all and those who emphasize elements of lifestyle above all. “It’s not nature or nurture, it’s both,” he said. The study got its start after Dr. Amit V. Khera, one of Dr. Kathiresan’s postdoctoral fellows, noticed that researchers had looked at genetic risks of heart disease  and had, in different studies, looked at the effect of environment and lifestyle risks. So, he wondered, why not look at lifestyles and genetics in the same populations and see how much each contributes? The researchers began about a year and a half ago, analyzing data from four large studies that not only had genetic data on participants but also had information on lifestyles and on which participants developed heart disease. The investigators developed a genetic score based on 50 genes associated with heart disease. They developed a lifestyle score based on whether people smoked, whether they exercised at least once a week, whether they followed a healthy diet  —   one with fruits, vegetables, fish, whole grains and nuts  —   and whether they were obese. An optimum lifestyle score was defined as having three or all four of these elements, which is important, Dr. Kathiresan said, because many people who are obese have enormous difficulty losing weight and maintaining their weight loss. “You can get into this group even if you are obese by not smoking, exercising and eating a healthy diet, “ he said. Even better, said Dr. Lawrence J. Appel, the director of the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research at Johns Hopkins Medicine, you do not have to have an exemplary lifestyle to reap a big benefit. It looks as if the biggest protective effect by far came from going from a terrible lifestyle to one that was at least moderately good. Dr. John Michael Gaziano, a preventive cardiologist at the VA Boston Healthcare System and at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, said the work showed the power of large data sets. Until recently, researchers mostly used much smaller data sets, which tend to have a lot of random variation, making results hard to interpret. The Million Veteran Program, a study that he is leading, and the National Institutes of Health’s precision medicine initiative that is recruiting a million participants should provide the sort of data that can make results like Dr. Kathiresan’s more feasible and more powerful. For Dr. Gaziano, the biggest surprise was that a test based on combining 50 genes, each of which had a tiny role in heart disease, was such a powerful predictor of risk. The larger studies underway now should allow researchers to understand more about how much each of those genes contributes, he added. Meanwhile, the new study shows a new way to think about genes and lifestyle, researchers say. “It’s very important,” said Dr. David Maron, the director of preventive cardiology at Stanford, who was not involved in the new study. “If you are dealt a bad hand, there are things you can do to attenuate the risk. ” Dr. Kathiresan is already using the study’s results when he sees patients, he said. The genetic test is not available outside of research studies, he said, but he often gets an idea of who has a worrisome genetic risk when he talks to patients. “A poor man’s substitute,” he said, “is: ‘My dad died at 45 of a heart attack. I have a strong family history. ’” He now replies, “You have it in your power to change that risk. ”"

BET founder: Trump ’committed to reaching out to African-Americans’," (CNN) The founder of BET said Monday night he is optimistic the lives of   could improve under   Donald Trump after meeting with him Sunday. Bob Johnson, who supported Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign, told CNN’s ”Erin Burnett Outfront” that he had a positive and frank discussion with Trump at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, adding that, ”I came away from the meeting understanding that President Trump is committed to reaching out to  .” Johnson said he told Trump, ”Don’t say to black Americans, ’What do you have to lose?’ say to black Americans ’What do you have to gain by a Trump presidency?’ ” He said they discussed a number of issues that could benefit the black community if they were implemented by the Trump administration. Responding to video of an   group leader declaring ”Hail Trump,” Johnson said, ”I know that there are people like that in America. It’s been that way ever since slavery existed in this country and they’re not going to go away tomorrow or the next day.”  He said Trump and his team ”gotta show me what they’re going to deliver to make those kind of silly Nazi behavior( s) irrelevant to black America.”  Johnson added that he believes Trump and his administration reject that kind of behavior. Johnson also ruled out serving in a Trump administration, saying he has no interest in serving in the government.  But he urged   to keep an open mind about supporting Trump, saying, ”If black Americans can turn the Republican Party into a friend, they should do it. If they can keep the Democratic Party as a friend, they should do it. Our interests should focus on our   and not be locked in one party or ignored by the other party. And as President (Barack) Obama and Hillary Clinton said, if we can find common ground with   Trump, we ought to do it in the best interest of   and the best interest of the country.”"
How Michael Flynn lost his job in 23 days," (CNN) US President Donald Trump’s national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned from his post Monday night amid claims he misled the administration over his communications with Russia before Trump took office. As Flynn stood down he admitted to giving ”incomplete information” to Vice President Mike Pence regarding phone calls with Russia’s ambassador to Washington. His resignation comes three days after Trump said he would look into the allegations. A US official told CNN Friday that Flynn discussed US sanctions with Russia before Trump took office, which could be a breach of the law. Here’s how it unfolded. Trump appoints Flynn, November 18: Trump as   appoints Flynn as his national security adviser. The appointment raises concerns as the retired Lieutenant General has a history of making controversial   remarks and is accused of mishandling classified information.  Flynn was fired from his role as the director of Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 by the Obama administration over claims he was a poor manager. Sanctions and phone calls, December 29: The Obama administration announces new sanctions against Russia and the expulsion of 35 of its diplomats over the country’s alleged interference in the 2016 US election. Flynn and Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak speak several times on the phone the same day. January 12: The Washington Post first reports that phone calls took place the day the White House announced Russian sanctions.  Pence refutes sanctions talk, January 15: Trump’s spokesman Sean Spicer confirms Flynn and Kislyak have been in communication, but Vice   Mike Pence tells CBS that the two men did not talk sanctions. ”They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States’ decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia,” Pence says. And as questions swirl over the allegations, Trump officials then claim the communications were focused on scheduling a call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Flynn under investigation, January 23: Three days after Trump officially takes office, US officials say investigators are scrutinizing several calls between Flynn and Russia’s ambassador. Spicer, now the White House Press Secretary, reiterates that Flynn told him sanctions were not discussed in the calls. At some point in January, the Justice Department warns the Trump administration that Flynn misled administration officials regarding his communications with Kislyak and is potentially vulnerable to blackmail by the Russians, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The message is delivered by Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, who is fired on January 30 for refusing to enforce Trump’s controversial travel ban barring citizens from seven   countries from entering the US. Official: Flynn did talk about sanctions, February 10: An aide close to Flynn says he cannot rule out that the adviser spoke about sanctions on the call with Kislyak. On the same day, Trump says he is unaware of reports that Flynn may have spoken about sanctions during the calls and says he will ”look into that.” A US official then confirms that Flynn and Kislyak did speak about sanctions, among other matters. February 13: Russia again denies the allegations that the men discussed sanctions, telling CNN: ”We have already said there haven’t been any.” On the same day, reports surface of the Justice Department’s warning to the administration regarding Flynn.  As the reports emerge, Trump’s counselor Kellyanne Conway tells MSNBC that Flynn ”does enjoy the full confidence of the president,” but around an hour later, Spicer says Trump is ”evaluating the situation.” Flynn resigns a few hours later, admitting he had ”inadvertently briefed the Vice   and others with incomplete information” regarding the phone calls with Kislyak and apologizes. He lasted 23 days after being sworn in at a White House ceremony on January 22. "
Canada Takes Down ’Known Wolf’ Islamic State Jihadi,"Working on a tip from the American FBI, Canada’s Royal Canadian Mounted Police moved against    Aaron Driver, an Islamic State supporter, and killed him after a tense standoff on Wednesday, before Driver could carry out a planned suicide bomb attack. [Reuters reports the raid was conducted in the small Ontario town of Strathroy, 140 miles south of Toronto. When the police confronted Driver, he detonated an explosive device, injuring himself and another person.  “I hear a bomb sound, like a ‘bang’  —   I was freaking out because this is a small and quiet town,” said eyewitness Irene Lee. “All of a sudden the policemen were yelling, ‘everyone get into your houses. ’” According to The Sun, the other person injured in the explosion was a taxi driver. Driver was shot dead by the RCMP after setting off the bomb. The Globe and Mail says Driver planned to take the taxi to a shopping mall in nearby London, Ontario. A CBC report adds that police informed Driver’s family that he “had another device, and planned to detonate it,” presumably in a suicide attack at the shopping mall. The FBI tip to Canadian authorities concerned an imminent “  attack in a major Canadian city. ” Driver was a perfect example of the “known wolf” jihadi, an individual who was very much on law enforcement’s radar screen, long before he attempted to murder innocents in the name of the Islamic State. A Muslim convert who sometimes used the alias Harun Abdulrahman, Driver was “under a court order from earlier this year to not associate with any terrorist organization, including ISIS,” as NBC News puts it. “In February, Driver’s lawyer and the prosecutor agreed to a peace bond stating there are ‘reasonable grounds to fear that he may participate, contribute directly or indirectly in the activity of a terrorist group,’” NBC adds. In Canada, a “peace bond” is essentially a form of extended probation  —   the signatory promises to “keep the peace” for a period of up to one year, or face criminal charges. “Obtaining a peace bond may take several weeks or even months, so peace bonds do not deal with emergencies. In an emergency, call 911,” Canada’s Department of Justice helpfully suggests. One such emergency would be when a jihadi is able to build multiple bombs, in spite of being theoretically under   surveillance because he’s a known terrorist sympathizer. According to the Globe and Mail, the conditions of Driver’s peace bond included “wearing a GPS tracking device, not using the Internet or having any communication with Islamic State, including not having any object on his person that bore an Islamic State logo. ” That would make him the second jihadi to carry out a violent attack while wearing a GPS tracker in the past month. “The restrictions drew criticism from civil liberties activists in Manitoba,” adds the Globe and Mail. The lawyer who helped him work out that peace bond, Leonard Tailleur, said he was “shocked” and “saddened to hear that it had to end this way for him. ” Perhaps Tailleur would be a bit less shocked if he studied the statements that brought Driver to the attention of police. In June 2015, he gave CBC a   interview in which he defended terrorist attacks against Canadian civilians by Islamists, and specifically stated that “when it does happen, they shouldn’t act surprised,” because “they had it coming to them, they deserved it. ” The reason CBC wanted to interview Driver for 90 minutes is that he was arrested by the RCMP, which confiscated his “  computer, phone, flash drives, and Koran,” because he had been posting   holy warrior messages on social media, justifying the terrorist murder of soldiers and police officers. The Globe and Mail notes that under his Harun Abdulrahman name, Driver had a “network of friends and followers who consisted mainly of British Muslims fighting for the Islamic State on the ground or online. ” “I think the big issue is I’m a Canadian living in Canada, and I’m OK with soldiers or police officers being targeted for what they’re doing to Muslims,” he said, correctly identifying something that should have been an even bigger issue with the authorities. “I think it’s a little hypocritical that people would take issue with people retaliating against them  …     when it’s the police and the military who are killing Muslims. ” He said that after he was arrested, the police kept asking him about Twitter messages from ISIS fighters and recruiters he had retweeted. “Driver doesn’t remember the exact motivation behind the retweet, but said he believes he found it funny at the time,” wrote CBC. In that lengthy interview, Driver said he got into some trouble as a teenager, but decided to straighten up his act at 17, when his girlfriend got pregnant. Since he came from a Christian family, he tried reading the Bible, but said he “just decided it couldn’t possibly be the word of God. ” “I started watching debates to find some answers. A lot of debates between Christians and atheists and Christians and Muslims, and the Muslims were always destroying them in these debates,” Driver said, further explaining that he became radicalized because of Western powers killing Muslims in the Middle East. He said he might be willing to give up his radical views if the West stopped killing, bombing, and arresting Muslims, and if Western nations “take responsibility for the crimes they’ve committed and just stay home and work on their own problems. ” Then he told Canadian authorities he wasn’t a threat, and they believed him. CBC quotes people who lived near Driver complaining that they weren’t told he was a terrorism suspect. “I think they should have, just so that we’re well aware of this, so that we can keep an eye out ourselves too. We should have the right to know. I’m pretty sure they had close tabs on this guy  …     but living beside him, I would feel not safe,” said one neighbor."
Bill Clinton brushes aside foundation criticism,"Denver (CNN) Bill Clinton aggressively denied allegations that donors to his family’s foundation were given special treatment by Hillary Clinton’s State Department in a lengthy interview with CNN set to air on Sunday. The entire Clinton interview will air Sunday at 9 a. m. on CNN’s ”State of the Union” with Jake Tapper. The former president told CNN’s Jake Tapper that no Clinton Foundation donor has ”asked me for anything,” adding that his wife was too busy as secretary of state to do favors for foundation supporters. ”She was pretty busy those years,” Clinton told Tapper. ”I never saw her study a list of my contributors, and I had no idea who was doing business before the State Department.” The Clinton Foundation and their rolls of foreign and corporate donors have become a flashpoint for Hillary Clinton’s newly announced presidential campaign. Critics and investigative reporters have sought to prove that supporters of the Clinton Foundation were currying favor with the Clintons when they donated, but no blatant example of influence peddling has been revealed in months of scrutiny. RELATED: Clinton Foundation admits mistakes, Clinton said that any crossover between Clinton Foundation donors and companies the State Department was lobbying for abroad was more happenstance than nefarious. ”America’s always had to lobby for   airplanes,” Clinton said, referring to the fact that Boeing, an American airplane manufacturer, had worked with both the State Department while also donating to the foundation’s work in Haiti.  ”I don’t think they (donated) to make the government like them better. We do like them better. All Americans are grateful that there are American jobs and businesses around the world,” Clinton said. ”So I don’t know of anything, if there was even an appearance of conflict, except all these folks helped us do what we do, which I think is good work.” While Clinton said nothing was ever given to the foundation’s donors, he said that he could not outright deny that any of his donors were hoping for anything in return when they cut his foundation a check. ”I know of no example, but I don’t ever know what people’s motives are,” he said. Clinton echoed many of his wife’s supporters and aides when he said attacks on his foundation were strictly about politics. ”Nobody even suggested it or talked about it or thought about it until the political season began,” Clinton said.. The foundation, however, has admitted they’ve made missteps in the past, particularly on the reporting and approval of their foreign donations. Foundation aides admitted earlier this year they ”made mistakes” in reporting, but did nothing intentionally wrong. Clinton’s comments came during the annual meeting of Clinton Global Initiative America in Denver, where foundation supporters made nearly 80 pledges to address issues such as providing   Americans with alternatives to predatory loans and providing Navajo Nation with solar power. In his interview with Tapper, Clinton described his foundation as an endeavor to ”get people who have money to people who don’t, and to give it to them in a way that’s empowering so it actually changes their lives.” Clinton reiterated that the foundation’s aim was to help the powerless people ”who are working as hard as they can, but who don’t have enough money to support their kids and meet basic human needs.” ”They can’t change the future,” he said. ”(For them) every tomorrow is just like yesterday. That’s how I define powerless. Not poverty. Not adversity alone. But the inability to alter your condition.” The entire Clinton interview will air Sunday at 9 a. m. on CNN’s ”State of the Union” with Jake Tapper."
John Mayer Knows He Messed Up. He Wants Another Chance. - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES  —   John Mayer can explain where he’s been. In fact, once he gets going, he probably won’t stop, given the amount of time he has spent in private processing his recent   irrelevance  —   the “lean years,” as he calls them. A generational guitar talent and reliable   hitmaker with seven Grammys, Mr. Mayer is also a master conversationalist prone to verbal solos, noodling in impressionistic bursts about his nature and career, weaving in   potential   bits and a barrage of mixed metaphors as if he’s writing this story himself. That’s what got him into trouble in the first place. “The elephant in the room is that we’re sort of talking about the   dragon of the Rolling Stone interview and the Playboy interview,” Mr. Mayer said a   into a monologue about why he left pop music’s   and how ready he is, emotionally and musically, to return. Across four hectic days this month, as Mr. Mayer, lucid and optimistic, finished his   new album, “The Search for Everything,” and filmed a music video for what he hopes will be his next hit single, he seemed to especially relish reflecting on his 2010 undoing. Recalling the consequences of those infamous magazine articles  —   in which he used the phrase “sexual napalm,” chronicled his onanism in horrific detail, referred to his male anatomy as David Duke and somehow separately used a racial epithet  —   Mr. Mayer was vivid and virtuosic in his  . “What has to happen for a guy to believe that he’s totally   and be that far out of touch?” he said. “My GPS was shattered, just shattered. ” At 32 and obsessed with outsmarting the idea of a “clichéd rock star,” he explained, “I started to invent my own grenade. ” (His big mouth.) He was “a Mack Truck without brakes. ” Tabloid fame was “a   hormone” and “extracurricular stuff” anyway, Mr. Mayer said. “I basically realized I’m no good at that, so I’m going to drop that major. ” Also: “What I did was probably semiconsciously just reboot it  —   control, alt, delete. ” “It was an induced coma. ” His career had “flatlined. ” “It was cat and mouse,” he said, “and the mouse lost. ” Now approaching 40, “I’m old enough to look back on my life and go: ‘That’s probably the photonegative shot in ‘Behind the Music,’” Mr. Mayer said. “Coming up after the break  —   boom  —   the downfall. ” In reality, after those turbulent moments he moved to Montana, grew out his hair and made two more   albums  —   “Born and Raised” and “Paradise Valley”  —   that were less “Your Body Is a Wonderland” and more Laurel Canyon. “It’s rivers and cows,” he said. “There’s no sexuality there. ” The relatively modest sales reflected that. But the exile couldn’t last, not for this restless   with the baby face and a penchant for dating some of the most famous women in the world (Jennifer Aniston, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry). In late 2014, as he began writing what would become “The Search for Everything,” out April 14, Mr. Mayer realized: “I’m a young guy. I like girls. I want girls to like me. I want to make music and be thought of as attractive. I was finally ready to   that world and grow back into it. ” He thought a lot about George Clooney. “There’s a guy who can make art house films and then just decide that he’s going to be in a blockbuster,” Mr. Mayer said. “I remember thinking to myself, O. K. I’m going to basically come out of retirement from blockbusters. It’s a choice to write pop songs, just like it’s a choice to write blues songs or folk songs. Let’s write the big ones that we are capable of writing. ” And that’s how John Mayer ended up dancing with pandas. In sweats at a Hollywood soundstage, Mr. Mayer was quick to pick up the choreography for the ensemble number that would be the centerpiece for his new video. The song, “Still Feel Like Your Man,” is throwback for him: a wistful but upbeat breakup ditty that, like much of his new music, “moves and throbs and has women in it again,” Mr. Mayer said. It’s also pretty plainly about missing his most recent ex, Ms. Perry, a fact that he acknowledged might get the tabloids chirping again. “Who else would I be thinking about?” he said. “And by the way, it’s a testament to the fact that I have not dated a lot of people in the last five, six years. That was my only relationship. So it’s like, give me this, people. ” For the video, Mr. Mayer wanted to think big, giving the track the best chance to succeed as a single. The syncopation of the guitar riff, he said, reminded him of “ancient Japanese RB”  —   which he acknowledged “isn’t a thing”  —   so the video concept followed suit. “I’m not gonna ever roll around in bedsheets again,” Mr. Mayer added. On set the next day, there was a makeshift bamboo forest, a woman in full geisha garb and two people in giant panda suits, making up a bizarre tableau that Mr. Mayer called a “disco dojo. ” Yet for someone so attuned to the risk of offending people again  —   “I have nightmares about a second occurrence of” the Playboy era, he said  —   Mr. Mayer seemed sanguine about the possibility of a controversy over cultural appropriation, an issue that has dogged other pop stars. “I think we were as sensitive as we could possibly be,” he said over burgers at the Polo Lounge the day after the video shoot. “It was discussed at every juncture. ” “Part of cultural appropriation is blindness,” he added. “I’m on the right side of the line because it’s an idea for the video that has a very multiethnic casting, and nobody who is white or   is playing an Asian person. ” The video’s director, who goes by Mister Whitmore, said he and Mr. Mayer “thought long and hard about how to approach” the “fantasy element” of the concept without offending. “I hope there’s an understanding that we were sensitive to it,” he said. Still, Mr. Mayer acknowledged the current discourse. “Do I think that someone is going to tweet that this is cultural appropriation? Yes,” Mr. Mayer, an internet obsessive, said. “It’s going to be interesting to see. ” (And then there’s the dancing.) The song’s commercial prospects are a separate concern. In Mr. Mayer’s absence from the Top 40, guitars have been further silenced by electronics. Even Ed Sheeran and Shawn Mendes, Mr. Mayer’s direct descendants, work with pop songwriting teams and cover rap tracks. “I do a thing  —   I have sensibilities,” said Mr. Mayer, who has often found himself overcompensating for his pristine but often edgeless bluesy pop and coffeehouse soul. “My instincts as a musician are not exactly my instincts as a listener or a member of the world. But I believe that I am successful because I obey them. ” He added: “The only hits I’ll have left in my life  —   because there are great hit writers, but I will not go into a room with them  —   are luck songs. My record has one name in the parentheses on every song, and it’s my name. That’s important. ” Writing “The Search for Everything,” which was released in two   “waves” before its final iteration to better suit the streaming era, proved spiritually purifying for Mr. Mayer, he said. “This was the only time in my life that I was making something that I could live inside of. I’ve built a home because I needed a place to stay, not because I was into selling homes. ” While it began as a breakup album, with songs like “Moving On and Getting Over” and “Never on the Day You Leave,” it quickly transcended that. “There were times when tears came out of me, and I went, O. K. John, this is not about an     relationship. This is something more profound. ” In the last six months or so, completing the record coincided with the flipping of a biological switch  —   he called it “a chemical care package”  —   for Mr. Mayer, who recently became an uncle for the first time: He really does want to settle down. “That’s the final frontier, man. ” But as he approaches a milestone birthday, “I wish there was somebody to throw me the 40th,” Mr. Mayer said, leaning into his corniness. “I want the baby with the protective earphones” by the side of the stage. He’s even been living out of a hotel for fear of establishing another bachelor pad. “I want to say, ‘We’ll take it,’” he said, adding, “I’m right on time for my career, and I’m running late for my life. ” It’s a process. Though he’s been in therapy to work on his “attachment style” and recently quit drinking (“I’m actually very thoughtfully entering cannabis life”) Mr. Mayer is wary that his notoriety as a womanizer precedes him. “I’ve inherited a younger man’s reputation,” he said. “You can even break ‘bad boy’ into good bad boy and bad bad boy  —   I somehow managed to become a bad version of a bad boy. ” Since splitting with Ms. Perry, he’s hardly been out at all, he insisted, though he does fiddle around on an exclusive dating app. “It’s just a lot of chatter,” he said. “We all talk to the same people. There are very few people actually meeting up. ” Another hurdle is that he will be on tour most of the year, headlining arenas in support of the album  —   he plays Madison Square Garden on April 5  —   plus a jaunt with his side gig, Dead  Company, where he plays guitar alongside members of the Grateful Dead. (“The feeling of inclusion that I have with this band  —   they saved my life,” he said.) The itinerant lifestyle, though, is less fraught than whatever lurks in the   recesses of Mr. Mayer’s soul, depths he is beyond game to probe and excavate. “In the Blood,” the most fully formed, Tom   track from “The Search for Everything,” is a sort of   with Mr. Mayer singing big questions with no answers: “It’s not pretty, those words,” Mr. Mayer said in the studio as he worked on final touches. “But the one thing I look forward to the most as I   this level of the music world is I really want to experience saying something that I can defend no matter what. “It’s like: ‘John, they’re gonna come after you. They’re going to ask about it,’” he said with a cackle. “I say, ‘Let ‘em. ’”"
Israel says there’s proof Obama pushed UN vote," (CNN) The spokesman for Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted Monday night that Israel has ”ironclad” proof that the Obama administration was behind a controversial UN Security Council vote to condemn Israeli settlements in the West Bank, but said it will be up to   Donald Trump’s administration to decide whether or not to release it. In an interview with Kate Bolduan on CNN’s ”Erin Burnett Outfront,” David Keyes declined twice to say that the White House lied by denying that it helped push the resolution, which the United States abstained from voting on. But Keyes did say: ”All I can say is we have that information and it is very clear to us. It’s not in doubt and we are going to pass it through the proper channels.” He added that there is solid information from the Arab world and internationally that the Obama administration helped craft and promote the resolution. Keyes also defended not releasing the ”ironclad” evidence now, contending that ”it’s something that should be shared with the new administration and that’s their choice whether they want to share it or not.” Keyes said he did not believe there would have been a different outcome if Obama and Netanyahu had closer ties, saying ”I don’t think this is personal. I think it’s a difference in world view.” Yet, he went on  to criticize the Obama administration, claiming the United States’ failure to veto the resolution was one of the president’s ”parting shots.” Keyes also downplayed concerns this would lead to a permanent rift between the United States and Israel, stating,  ”This is not going to be a cessation of ties between America and Israel or anything like that. We look forward to working with the incoming administration.”"
GWB Daughter Barbara Bush to Keynote Planned Parenthood Fundraiser,"Former President George W. Bush’s daughter, Barbara Pierce Bush, will deliver the keynote address at a Planned Parenthood fundraiser in North Texas. [Bush, the CEO and   of Global Health Corps (GHC) is headlining Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas’s 2017 Fort Worth luncheon, reports the Texas Tribune:  High schoolers! Earn community service hours, learn about sexual health, and inspire change Register now: https:  . ! pic. twitter.   —   Planned Parenthood (@PPGreaterTX) February 4, 2017,  “We believe that every person has the right to live a healthy, dignified life,” GHC says in its mission statement. “We also believe that everyone has a role to play in advancing social justice through the health equity movement. ” Bush, 34, joined with her twin sister, Jenna Bush Hager, and others to found GHC in 2009. The organization says its main concern is that “access to healthcare that exists today between the world’s rich and the world’s poor is unjust and unsustainable. ” Speaker sponsors for the fundraiser for the abortion chain’s Greater Texas affiliate will pay $20, 000, while Platinum and Gold Sponsors will pay $10, 000 and $5, 000, respectively. As Breitbart News reported in June of 2016, the New York Times interviewed Bush and Planned Parenthood’s president, Cecile Richards, as they lunched at the Gotham Bar and Grill. “Can I say how impressive Barbara is?” Richards complimented Bush. “It’s one thing to work at a    organization like Planned Parenthood, trying to shift the boat into the 21st century. But it’s another to say: ‘I see a problem, and I’m going to start an organization to fix it. ’” Bush explained her motivation to form her organization. “Since I was born, in 1981, we’ve had the drugs to save the millions of kids around the world who die every year,” she said. “Yet the number of deaths hasn’t dropped at all. We have the tools to keep people healthy, but the systems are broken. ” Richards commiserated with her: “It’s the same in reproductive health. We have the technology. But it’s not enough unless there’s public policy that supports getting women access to care. ” Richards is the daughter of the late Gov. Ann Richards (D) of Texas, who eventually lost to Bush’s father, Republican President George W. Bush, when he ran for governor of Texas in 1994. One of the main connections Richards and Bush have is Hillary Clinton. Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry endorsed Clinton in her bid for the White House in 2016. Clinton said unborn babies have no constitutional rights and that, if elected president, she would work to have the Hyde Amendment repealed so that taxpayer funds could be used for abortions  —   an outcome that would have been an obvious boost for the abortion business. GHC provides opportunities for young people to “work on the frontlines of the fight for global health equity” and offers paid fellowships for them with various “placement” organizations, among them Planned Parenthood Global. Additionally, GHC has provided “placements” at the Clinton Development Initiative, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, and the Clinton Health Matters Initiative  —   all of which are part of the Clinton Foundation. Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich details the vast amounts of money that have flowed to both Bill and Hillary Clinton through their foundation from corporations and nations seeking favorable treatment from them. In August of 2013, Bush said she hoped Clinton would run for president because she is “unbelievably accomplished. ” Bush told Richards during their lunch interview, “It’s crazy and sad to think that health care is a polarizing issue. ” She went on to say that the young people in her organization are able to “work on social change” at “Planned Parenthood and other exceptional organizations. ”"
Texas Governor’s Mansion Shines Blue in Support of Law Enforcement - Breitbart,"Texas Governor Greg Abbott turned the Governor’s Mansion blue on Saturday night, but not the way Democrats had hoped in 2014. The Texas governor flooded his official residence with blue floodlights in support of law enforcement officers across the Lone Star State. [Governor Abbott took the action of turning the mansion blue in honor of Law Enforcement Appreciation Day (LEAD) Saturday evening. He said he wanted to show law enforcement all across the state that Texans support the work they do to keep us safe.  “We can never give thanks enough to our law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line every day to protect us,” Governor Abbott said in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. “Lighting the mansion in blue is a small gesture in showing the State of Texas’ appreciation for all that they do. I encourage all Texans to stand with law enforcement on this day and say ‘thank you’ for their service to our great state. ” Texas’ First Lady, Cecilia Abbott joined her husband’s support of law enforcement. “To our law enforcement who protect our communities and keep us safe, thank you for your service,” the Texas First Lady wrote on her Facebook page. The move by the governor comes following a year were officers across the nation have been gunned down simply for being cops. Just last week, Philadelphia police officer Jesse Hartnett was shot three times while sitting in his car. The shooting was an apparent execution attempt in the name of Islam, Breitbart News’ John Hayward reported. In August, Breitbart Texas reported on the execution style murder of Harris County Deputy Sheriff Deputy Darren Goforth. The Houston based deputy was shot multiple times in the back of his head and in his back as he walked, in uniform, from a convenience store to his patrol car that was parked at a gas pump. The only known motivation for the shooting at this point is Goforth was wearing a cop uniform. Many other police officers were executed across the nation during 2015. In May, three Breitbart Texas journalists were inside the Curtis Culwell Center during the attack by two Muslim terrorists at the Muhammad Art Exhibit in Garland, Texas. As the two terrorists stepped out of their car with assault rifles blazing, one police officer, armed only with his service pistol, stepped out of his patrol car and stopped the attack. Were it not for his bravery, and that of the other Garland police officers who were on the scene to protect attendees, the Garland terror attack might have resembled the San Bernardino and Paris terror attacks. Law enforcement officers made the difference. In an   published in National Review, Ted Cruz agreed. “Law enforcement forms a thin but powerful line protecting us not just from violent criminals, but from terrorists on our own soil. In the case of Garland, Texas, Islamic terrorists could have taken unknown numbers of lives if it were not for the brave traffic officer who stopped their attempted attack. ” Law enforcement agencies across the state responded to the Governor’s gesture of support. The Cedar Hill Police Department called the mansion lighting “a Texas Sized Thank You,” in a Facebook post. The Fort Worth Police Officers Association posted the photo of the illuminated mansion on its Facebook page and said, “The Governor’s Mansion in Austin, TX is illuminated blue tonight for Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. ‪#‎ThankYou. ” “I want to join Governor Abbott in expressing my most since gratitude to all law enforcement personnel,” said Harris County Tax   Mike Sullivan. “I appreciate what they do, and for the sacrifices they make. Without them, we would be a lawless society. ” Texas Supreme Court Justice Jeff Brown posted a photo of his favorite police officer, his father. Republican Party of Texas chairman, Tom Mechler, @tommechler, tweeted, “On Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, we salute those who serve!” Perhaps no one can appreciate the service and sacrifice of law enforcement officers more than the spouse of a police officer. Megan Justine, the wife of a police officer, wrote on her Facebook page: As the wife of a Police Officer I honor them every day. I pray one day all can honor the sacrifices they knowingly make every single day. As Sen. Cruz stated ‘Blue lives protect Black lives and all lives.’ Let’s stop vilifying them and stand with them in the name of delivering us from evil. Are there a few bad eggs in there? Sure. But the mass majority are out there day after day and night after night, while their families are at home praying they return home safely, protecting and serving communities. Who will you call when you’re the victim of a crime or violence? The Police. And they will be there to protect you.

The Guardian: Trump Victory Provides NRA Historic ’Moment to Go on Offense’,"Donald Trump’s victory ushers in what the NRA’s Wayne LaPierre describes as a historic “moment to go on offense” and to take new ground for the Second Amendment, rather than spend the next four years trapped in a defensive position. [The offensive will include national reciprocity, also known as national right to carry, as well as deregulation of suppressors, rolling back President Obama’s executive orders, and abolishing   zones on military bases.  According to the Guardian, these pursuits, particularly passage of national reciprocity, allow the NRA to go after what LaPierre described as the “tyrannical erosion of gun rights. ” He knows that national reciprocity will bring states like California, New York, and Illinois into conformity with the rest of the country on concealed carry, thereby chipping away at the “deceitful web of gun bans, ammo bans, magazine bans, exorbitant fees, and taxes and registration schemes” at the state level. The Guardian stated it this way: “This federal national reciprocity law, which Trump has already endorsed, would essentially gut existing local restrictions on carrying guns in public, and would mean that tourists from other states could soon carry their guns around New York City. ” Those who paid attention during the campaign already know that more concealed carry permit holders in more places is exactly what Trump supports. He repeatedly stressed that bad guys need to learn how it feels when “bullets go both ways. ” Following the June 12 attack at the Orlando Pulse   zone, Trump stressed that concealed carry could have prevented the attack or at least lessened the severity of it. He said: If some of those great people that were in that club that night had guns strapped to their waist or strapped to their ankle —  and if bullets were going in the other direction, aimed at that guy [for whom this was just] target practice —  you would have had a situation which would have [been] horrible, but nothing like the carnage that we as a people suffered this weekend. The NRA has an advocate for concealed carry and   heading to the White House. The biggest prize, however, was always the Supreme Court, and remains so even now. The Guardian quoted the NRA’s Jennifer Baker saying, “The most important issue for us this cycle was the SCOTUS [supreme court] nominee and protecting Heller. Trump will appoint a new justice soon after he enters office, so our top priority will become a reality. ” The Heller decision reaffirmed that the Founding Fathers intended the Second Amendment to hedge in the individual right to keep and bear arms, rather than a collective right. Dick Heller, the man behind the Heller suit, opined on what Trump’s election and anticipated SCOTUS nominations mean for the Second Amendment: “Now I think at least for half a generation, I think we’re OK. Maybe a full generation. Maybe two. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of “Bullets with AWR Hawkins,” a Breitbart News podcast.

China may be about to tax currency trading,"”China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China, could be about to implement rules designed to curb speculative trading in currency markets.” ’According to a report from  which cited anonymous sources, the PBOC has drafted rules for a Tobin tax on currency trading.’ ’”The initial rate of the   Tobin tax may be kept at zero to allow authorities time to refine the rules,” Bloomberg said, citing the sources. ”The tax is not designed to disrupt hedging and other   transactions undertaken by companies. ”’ ”The sources told Bloomberg that the rules still needed approval from the central government and that it wasn’t clear how quickly they could be implemented.” ’No further details, including what currencies would be affected, were provided.’ ’The tax, named after Nobel Laureate economist James Tobin, who first floated the idea, would tax all spot   conversions from one currency into another.’ ’The increased transactional cost would, according to the idea, discourage some speculative forms of trading.’ ’Bloomberg suggests that the ”tax would complicate plans by China to create an international reserve currency and could undermine the leadership’’s pledge to increase the role of market forces in the world’’s   economy. ”’ ’The draft ruling may have been prompted by a surge in capital outflows from China over the past year.’ ”China’s FX reserves fell by  the largest annual decrease on record.

’Trump-like’ ’Julius Caesar’ stirs debate,"New York (CNN) The audience gathered in New York’s Delacorte Theater in Central Park for a new rendition of William Shakespeare’s ”Julius Caesar” gasped in delight when the title character first strode across the stage, not in a toga, but adorned in a business suit and tie that fell unfashionably below his belt and sporting a presidential yellow coif of hair atop his head.   Their reaction to the   character subsided as the audience assumedly skipped ahead to the scene when they would witness (spoiler alert!) the gory assassination of this blonde, boisterous, Trumpian emperor. Indeed, this year’s Shakespeare in the Park production, produced by the New York’s Public Theater, puts a   twist on the ancient tale of power, deceit and rebellion: The backdrop includes American icons and images of past presidents. Graffiti on walls proclaim calls to ”Resist!” Caesar is intentionally played like Trump in dress and manner and his wife, Calpurnia, speaks in a Slavic accent, resembling first lady Melania Trump.  While the dialogue remains almost entirely true to the original Shakespeare, there is one reference to how Caesar is so beloved by the common public that he could stab ”their mothers on Fifth Avenue,” a reference to Trump’s own claim that he could shoot a person in public and be forgiven by his supporters. In the story, a conspiracy of statesmen, worried that Caesar will assume too much power, plot to kill him on the Ides of March, the date a soothsayer warns Caesar to beware. Caesar, in his hubris, ignores the warning and pleas from his wife to stay home. ”Shakespeare’s political masterpiece has never felt more contemporary,” the theater’s promotional materials reads.  When it’s time for the assassination scene, the conspirators tear Caesar from his podium and stab him repeatedly until he’s left sprawled on stage in a mess of bloodstained clothes. Caesar’s friend, Brutus, delivers the final blow that ends his life. The decision to portray Caesar as the nation’s president is, under any administration, a controversial artistic choice. The show’s previews opened on May 23, near the time comedian Kathy Griffin came under fire for participating in a photo shoot that depicted her holding a bloody, decapitated head in Trump’s image. She ultimately apologized. And news of this rendition of Shakespeare’s classic has stirred debate about whether it is appropriate to portray the killing of a sitting leader.  But Shakespeare’s play is no celebration of violent insurrection. As the audience that sticks around until the end learns, the aftermath of Caesar’s murder is a disaster for the conspirators and the nation.  ”Julius Caesar can be read as a warning parable to those who try to fight for democracy by undemocratic means,” the play’s director, Oskar Eustis said in a statement promoting the performance. ”To fight the tyrant does not mean imitating him.” "
Ted Cruz on Rubio and Trump: Both ’Have Supported Banning Guns’ - Breitbart,"Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) blasted rivals Donald Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) accusing them both of supporting bans on guns. [“Did you know that my two leading opponents have supported banning guns?” Cruz said in Perry, Georgia on Saturday.  Soon after Cruz made the claim, his national press secretary Catherine Frazier tweeted that as Florida House Speaker, Rubio worked against a bill to expand gun rights. “As FL House Spkr Rubio worked against bill to expand gun rights, to allow   citizens to leave guns in cars at work,” Frazier tweeted.  “As a West Miami Commissioner, Rubio voted to ban guns in parks. ”"
How to Stay Comfortable on a Long Flight - The New York Times,"There’s nothing like a   flight to get you over a fear of flying. At least that was the case for me after my first trip to South Africa to visit the family of the woman who eventually became my wife. At 28, I was still pretty new to flying, and spending the better part of an entire day trapped in an airborne steel tube was just what I needed to stop worrying and learn to love the miracle of air travel. O. K. the truth is, I still don’t love to fly. But after that first marathon ride from New York to Johannesburg, which is among the longest   flights in existence, my focus has at least shifted from how to survive to how to make the long haul as painless as possible. The simplest way to guarantee a decent meal and some legroom is to upgrade to first class, but if you don’t have the luxury of spending a few hundred extra for premium seats, all is not lost. “Most air carriers configure their   economy cabins with slightly more legroom and added amenities,” said  Patrick Smith, a pilot who is author of “Cockpit Confidential: Everything You Need to Know About Air Travel. ” These amenities typically include free access to entertainment consoles, meals and alcoholic beverages. In other words, airlines are not completely evil, and are less likely to    you during   flights. That also applies to legroom. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of leg space available in economy class during my first long haul to South Africa. But this does vary by airline. South African Airways has roomier seats (by one to two inches) on its nonstop flight from New York to Johannesburg than any other airline that flies between those two cities, according to Routehappy. com, a useful site that allows you to compare amenities before booking. Consider Seatguru. com when trying to find the most comfortable seat. But these freebies and a little extra legroom will get you only so far. A smartly packed   bag is essential. “A big mistake is expecting the flight attendants to take care of everything for you,” said Kara Mulder, a flight attendant who chronicles her   experiences on her blog, The Flight Attendant Life.  Ms. Mulder recommends taking your own water, a sweatshirt and socks to keep you warm (I never fly without my hoodie) and some of your favorite healthy snacks. “Don’t just eat the free food the flight attendants serve because it’s there,” Ms. Mulder said. “Your body will respond differently to different foods when at altitude. ” Dry oatmeal and dried fruit are favorites of Ms. Mulder. I’ve found trail mix and protein and granola bars to be safe and sustainable options. I’ve also learned not to be shy. If you napped your way through mealtime or did not pack enough water, take a walk to where the flight attendants are and ask for what you need. You still have 13 hours to go. Nothing puts a damper on a vacation like a blood clot in the knee. Studies have found that   travel increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, and that height is an additional risk factor, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s still a rare condition, but the C. D. C. recommends “ambulation,” which is a fancy word for walking and thigh exercises, and suggests aisle seats for those who are particularly tall. Even if you’re not concerned about a blood clot, walking and stretching will make you less miserable in general, and there is plenty you can do without even leaving your seat. How about a little yoga at 39, 000 feet? “When it comes to a physical release, the yoga exercises help right away,” said Kajuan Douglas, a yoga instructor in New York City. “ You feel the physical stretch, and it’s like you have just awakened from sleep. ” You do not have to be a yogi to benefit from these stretches. The simplest ones can bring instant satisfaction. For beginners, Mr. Douglas recommends the “Locust Bind” stretch, which involves interlacing your fingers behind your back and drawing your shoulder blades toward each other, and “seated twisting,” placing your hand on your opposite knee or thigh and twisting from the upper back. It may seem hard to do when the toddler behind you is kicking your seat or your neighbor is snoring. “To help overcome these difficulties, I bring more awareness to my breath or add a simple mantra,” Mr. Douglas said. “Simply recite ‘inhale let, exhale go’ ” mentally as you breathe. ” If there is a silver lining to having 16 hours to kill, it’s that you can at least get something accomplished like work or reading that novel you’ve yet to make a dent in. But it’s not as easy as it sounds, especially if you do not plan ahead. You may be distracted by turbulence or the drink cart rolling by, and that first gin and tonic leads to another. Before you know it, you’re poking at the entertainment console and pondering which Adam Sandler movie you haven’t already seen 10 times. “I’m an author and blogger who writes about air travel,” Mr. Smith said, “but I find it almost impossible to get anything done, even with my subject matter all around me. ” Compartmentalizing your time is the way to go, and can make the flight feel much shorter. “Devote blocks of time to certain tasks,” Mr. Smith said. “Pick out a couple of movies to watch that’s three or four hours right there. Spend a couple of hours reading, then a couple of hours napping if you can, and so on. ” If you are intent on getting work done, you could try something like the Pomodoro Technique, which divides work into   intervals and separates them by short breaks. “I can be on a   flight and not watch one movie from the plane’s   entertainment system sometimes, simply because I planned out my tasks and airplane relax time so well,” Ms. Mulder said. “Those are good flights. ” That still feels like an oxymoron to folks like me but less so these days."

Mike Pompeo: Attempts to Invalidate Trump’s Presidency Plays into Putin’s Hands - Breitbart,"During his confirmation hearing, Congressman Mike Pompeo ( ) said he would observe the proper laws forbidding enhanced interrogation of terror suspects and affirmed that he believes Russia is a threat to the United States. He also noted, however, that attempts to undermine   Donald Trump plays right into the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin. [On Thursday, the U. S. Senate held its first hearing for the confirmation of Rep. Pompeo,   Donald Trump’s nominee to become CIA chief. While the hearing kicked off with a temporary power outage in the room, the congressman fielded a range of questions from metadata, to   torture, to privacy concerns. One senator, California’s Kamala Harris, even went off on a tangent asking Pompeo about NASA global warming data and Pompeo’s views on gay marriage.  When it came time to talk about Russia, though, Pompeo had a dual warning. The Kansan said that Russia is not an ally of the United States, but also insisted that attempts to invalidate Donald Trump’s presidency is serving the   policies of Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Agreeing with the U. S. intelligence community’s latest assessment of Russia, Pompeo also said it is “pretty clear” that the Russians tried to influence the U. S. elections. “It’s pretty clear about what took place here, about Russian involvement in efforts to hack information and to have impact on American democracy,” Pompeo said during the Senate Intelligence Committee meeting. “I’m very   about what that intelligence report says. This was an aggressive action taken by the senior leadership inside of Russia. ” Pompeo also said he would support an extensive investigation into just what forms that “aggressive action” took during the 2016 campaign saying, “I will continue to pursue foreign intelligence with vigor no matter where the facts lead. ” “The internet,” Pompeo said, “is a borderless, global environment, easily and frequently exploited by sophisticated adversaries like China and Russia, as well as by less sophisticated adversaries like Iran and North Korea,   actors, terrorist groups, criminal organizations, and hackers. ” He also warned though that constant speculation that the election was hacked plays into Putin’s hands. During his response on the matter he said he has “no doubt that the discourse that’s been taking place is something Putin would look at and say, ‘That was among the objectives that I have. ’” As for another topic, many liberals have worried about Pompeo’s thoughts on the CIA using enhanced interrogation. The question seemed fairly answered when Senators Feinstein and Heinrich both quizzed him on the topic. Pompeo told Feinstein he would not   the enhanced interrogation policy if he were to become head of the CIA and assured Senator Heinrich that he would stick to the Army field manual for interrogation that currently forbids such techniques. As to Iran, Pompeo said that despite his personal opinions and his past claims that he would work to repeal Obama’s “disastrous deal” with Iran, he would abide by whatever his President told him to do on the issue. The congressman also fielded questions about his past comments on gathering metadata. While noting that intelligence is the “lifeblood” of national security, he added that such intel “is more in demand than ever. ” The Supreme Court has ruled that metadata is not private personal information, but nonetheless Pompeo said he would certainly toe the line of the law  —   whatever that may be  —   on the collection of data. He was also asked for his thoughts on demanding that tech companies give the U. S. government keys to their encryption of data. Pompeo replied that personal privacy would be an important concern for him and added, “I think we need to acknowledge that encryption is out there, and not all encryption takes place in the United States,” Pompeo replied. But even as Pompeo said he’d toe the law on these matters, Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn asked Pompeo if he will “play to the edge” of the law as CIA director so as not to play too cautious with national security. The Congressman said he would be sure to be mindful of the needs of his operatives and added, “It’s my role to make sure those lines are clear and bright. ” Pompeo also faced questioning from California Democrat Kamala Harris who seemed to feel his stance against gay marriage would hamper his work to secure the nation. She also quizzed him on global warming, asking if he would accept climate change claims made by NASA. Seemingly bemused by the quixotic line of questioning, Pompeo assured Harris that as a small businessman he’s never let anyone’s sexuality interfere in what he expected of them as an employee and that, as an engineer by training, facts and data drive his life  —   so if he found believable data on climate change it would certainly be an important consideration in his thought process. The hearing was not without humor, either, as Arizona Republican John McCain, a graduate of the Naval Academy, joked that Pompeo’s education was “very poor” because he was a graduate of West Point.

The political history of Don King,"Washington (CNN) Boxing promoter Don King thrust himself back into the political scene Wednesday when he dropped the   at a Donald Trump minority outreach event. It’s the latest step into the political fray for King, who has a long history of colorfully weighing in on politics on both sides of the aisle going back half a century. After serving nearly four years in prison for a manslaughter conviction in 1966 for killing an associate who owed him $600, King was later pardoned of the crime in 1983 by   Gov. Jim Rhodes. The governor received letters of recommendation from several luminaries, including former presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, a Democrat, and   mayor (and future Ohio senator) George Voinovich, a Republican. In 1992, King invoked his Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions before a Senate subcommittee investigating ties between boxing and organized crime. Here are a few other political highlights from King’s career: ’Republicrat’ At the June funeral for Muhammad Ali, with whom King at one point worked, he declared his   status. ”I’m endorsing the people. I’m not a Republican or a Democrat, I’m a Republicrat, and I go with the will of the people,” he told the New York Daily News. Hillary Clinton, King previously praised Trump’s Democratic presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, calling her ”dynamic” at a 2014 fundraiser for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, a major Trump critic. ”I have been a supporter of Secretary Clinton for a long time,” King said at the event, which benefited the Nevada senator’s   campaign. ”She is a dynamic woman, and I am a fighter for woman’s rights,” he added. Barack Obama, The Cleveland native supported President Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012. At the time, he said white voters struggling to get behind a black candidate need to move past it. King said they should ”ask God to help you pretend that Barack Obama is white,” he told journalists.  ”I understand very well that after more than three centuries of being taught, conditioned and indoctrinated to hate the black man as your inferior, it is unrealistic to think that now you can just change to respect him,” he wrote.  ”Try to think of your beloved country America and what’s best for Miss Liberty,” King added. ”Then try not to think of Barack Obama as a black man but as an American fighting for what’s best for your children and your country.” Reince Priebus, King, The New York Times reported, was supposed to address this summer’s Republican National Convention, but several Republican National Committee officials, including chairman Reince Priebus, nixed the idea, citing the promoter’s legal problems. King later said the party chairman removed him because he doesn’t ”like black people.” ”I’m not speaking because Reince Priebus is still thinking he don’t like black people,” King told reporters in July. ”I have less than a damn about what Reince Priebus thinks, especially when he’s so antiquated.” Black Lives Matter, King spoke on the tensions between black residents and law enforcement, saying the ”root” of the problem gets lost in social media. ”You can’t use   slogans because people don’t understand and they twist them around,” he said on the floor of the Republican National Convention. ”In our hashtag culture, we treat the effects, not the cause. You’ve got to get to the cause.” Female voters, ”You got to understand what I’m trying to say to you is that the white woman    and I put it in this kind of (words) so you understand what I’m saying    the white woman and the slave, the people of color,” King said Wednesday while campaigning for Trump. ”When the system was created, they did not get heard. The first will be last and the last will be first.” ”The white woman did not have the rights, and she still don’t have the rights,” he added. ”And people of color don’t have their rights    those are the ’left outs. ’” ”Donald Trump says no    we (are) going back to inclusiveness,” King added. ”Everybody counts.” On which political party is best for black voters, ”Martin Luther King says that both the Republican and the Democrat have a long history of using the black vote as a political football: Promise us everything, give us nothing,” he told New York Magazine in 2004. George W. Bush, ”Oooh! I get a passion. I’m getting excited right now when you said that. George Walker Bush    he’s   but he’s  . He’s trying to reclaim that glory of that American Dream for all Americans. He put   in top policy positions higher than any president. He took two people, black, and put them in charge of 300 million people for their security,” he told New York Magazine. On Bush and terrorism, ”George Bush utilizes the big stick. Whatever means necessary. If he wasn’t in that White House when we had that despicable attack of terrorism in New York, I shudder to think, I tremble at what would be happening. We would probably have to be doing this interview on the underground, secretly, for fear if we’d go to the street, the treachery that abounds would take alight,” he said in New York Magazine."

Woman arrested in shooting of FSU professor," (CNN) A woman was arrested Saturday in connection with the 2014 death of a renowned Florida State University Law School professor. Investigators say Katherine Magbanua, 31, helped arrange the murder of Daniel Markel amid a bitter custody dispute with his   Wendi Adelson.  After the couple divorced in 2013, Markel prevailed against the Adelson family’s attempts to move Wendi and the two Markel children from Tallahassee to South Florida, where the Adelsons live, according to a probable cause affidavit.   Investigators described Magbanua as ”the only tie” between the two accused shooters and the Adelson family. Sigfredo Garcia and Luis Rivera were charged with capital murder in May in Markel’s death and are being held without bond.  Magbanua was arrested in Broward County, where she lives, on a charge of   murder. Magbanua’s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. She will be brought to Leon County to face the charge, CNN affiliate WCTV said. The probable cause affidavit describing the investigation suggests Magbanua was compensated for her alleged involvement.  In the 12 months before Markel’s death, Magbanua made cash deposits totaling $15, 000. In the 12 months after his death, she made cash deposits totaling $44, 000, in addition to paychecks from the Adelson family dental practice. The windfall led to some   purchases, the affidavit states, including a new car and breast augmentation surgery. Family dispute turns deadly? Investigators believe Magbanua enlisted Garcia and Rivera to kill Markel at the Adelson family’s behest. She had a prior romantic relationship with Wendi Adelson’s brother, Charlie Adelson. She was one of the top contacts in Charlie Adelson’s phone. At the time of the shooting she was living with Garcia, the father of her two children. Markel was shot twice in the head while sitting in his car on July 18, 2014. Markel’s prominence as a criminal justice scholar catapulted his death into the national spotlight, dredging up details of an acrimonious divorce and custody battle. Wendi Adelson’s mother, Donna Adelson, tried to persuade her daughter to offer Markel $1 million to move the children, the affidavit states. She also suggested lying to him by saying the children could be converted from Judaism to Catholicism if they stayed in Tallahassee. When Wendi refused those tactics, ”Donna was extremely upset,” the affidavit says. Before Markel’s death the couple was due in court to argue Markel’s request for supervised visitation for Donna Adelson. Markel alleged his children had told him their grandmother ”hated” Markel for ”taking her sunshines away from her.” After his death, Wendi Adelson changed the children’s surnames from Markel to Adelson and removed her son’s middle name of Markel’s deceased grandmother. Wendi Adelson told investigators that her brother, Charlie Adelson, had joked about hiring a hit man to kill Markel, the affidavit states. He allegedly told her it would be cheaper to ”buy her a television as a divorce gift.” She told investigators she did not think her brother would actually commit the crime. Cell phones and surveillance videos provide clues, Cell phone records show numerous contacts between Magbanua and both Charlie Adelson and Garcia in the weeks before Markel’s death, the affidavit says.  Evidence from their cellular service providers suggests they left North Miami on July 16 and arrived in Tallahassee shortly after midnight on July 17, the day before the shooting. Further cell phone records suggest the two were in the area of Markel’s home on July 17. It also puts them near the health club Markel visited on July 18 before he was shot to death, the affidavit states.  The morning of his death, Markel dropped off his two children at day care about 5 miles from his home around 8:50 a. m. the affidavit states. He then visited the gym, arriving at 9:12 a. m. and leaving around 10:38 a. m. Surveillance videos show a Toyota Prius rented in Rivera’s name trailing Markel’s car to the health club, waiting in the parking lot, and following him home. A neighbor who heard the shots reported seeing a car resembling a Prius pulling out of Markel’s driveway after the shooting. Investigators believe the men turned their phones off before 10 a. m. and turned them back on after the shooting around 12:30 p. m. Cell phone records show Magbanua was the first person Garcia called after turning his phone on, from the area of Lake City, Florida. Wendi Adelson initially cooperated with police, the affidavit says. She told investigators she wanted to relocate to South Florida with her children but she felt that her   would suspect she was involved in Markel’s death because the court had denied her the ability to move there previously. While at the police station, Wendi asked to call her parents. After she called her mother, cell phone records indicate Donna Adelson called Charlie Adelson. After speaking to his mother, cell phone records indicate Charlie Adelson called Magbanua."
"Tancredo: Over 300 Sanctuary Cities Are Costing State and Local Taxpayers over $7,000,000,000 Annually - Breitbart","President Trump this week signed an executive order declaring war on   sanctuary cities. Agencies within the United States Government will begin withholding federal grant funds from those cities, and additional actions to enforce federal immigration law will be taken soon. [Unlike Obama, President Trump is not trying to making new laws by executive decree. In his Executive Order, the president is only reminding mayors and governors of existing federal law dating to 1996:  U. S. Code › Title 8 › Chapter 12 › Subchapter II › Part IX › § 13738 U. S. Code § 1373  —   Communication between government agencies and the Immigration and Naturalization Service: Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal, State, or local law, a Federal, State, or local government entity or official may not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, the Immigration and Naturalization Service information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual. (b) Additional authority of government entitiesNotwithstanding any other provision of Federal, State, or local law, no person or agency may prohibit, or in any way restrict, a Federal, State, or local government entity from doing any of the following with respect to information regarding the immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual:(1) Sending such information to, or requesting or receiving such information from, the Immigration and Naturalization Service. (2) Maintaining such information. (3) Exchanging such information with any other Federal, State, or local government entity. (c) Obligation to respond to inquiriesThe Immigration and Naturalization Service shall respond to an inquiry by a Federal, State, or local government agency, seeking to verify or ascertain the citizenship or immigration status of any individual within the jurisdiction of the agency for any purpose authorized by law, by providing the requested verification or status information. (Pub. L. 104 —  208, div. C, title VI, § 642, Sept. 30, 1996, 110 Stat. 3009 —  707. The president’s executive order is not only good news for law enforcement, it is also a good civics lesson for some mayors and even some members of Congress. The Trump executive order is also good news for taxpayers. Sanctuary cities impose a huge, billion cost to taxpayers that has been hidden from public view and shielded from political accountability. This will be news to you because those annual taxpayer costs are hidden from public scrutiny  —   by Congress, by state legislatures, and by local officials. Sanctuary city policies have a high cost not only in allowing criminal aliens to roam free on our streets, they also impose a huge burden on taxpayers. How can we estimate those taxpayers costs? There is a wealth of data hidden in the annual reports on the federal State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) published by the US Department of Justice and each state department of corrections that chooses to apply for reimbursement grants under that program. Over 2, 000 local county sheriffs also get federal reimbursement grants under that federal program. The taxpayer costs revealed by those annual reports are  . States and local communities are being reimbursed at less than three cents on the dollar of the true costs for criminal alien incarceration, but politicians are hiding that fact from the nation’s taxpayers. In my home state of Colorado, the 2016 SCAAP report by the state Department of Corrections revealed that state prison system was holding 2, 039 criminal aliens at a cost of $37, 958 per inmate. That is a total cost of $77, 396, 362. The federal reimbursement grant was $2, 077, 720. That is a grant of 2. 7 cents for every dollar of actual cost. Those 2, 039 criminal alien inmates were 14% of all state prison inmates: One in every seven felons in the state prison system is a criminal alien. What are the comparable numbers for your state? You can discover the SCAAP grant amounts for each state prison system and the local county jails applying for federal reimbursement at this website. The federal SCAAP grant program was established by Congress as an acknowledgment of federal responsibility for a failed border security and failed federal enforcement of immigration laws. But the appropriated amount for reimbursing local communities their incarceration costs through SCAAP grants has NEVER been adequate for full cost reimbursement. In 2016, the federal reimbursement program was given a paltry $189 million. To most Americans, these hidden taxpayer costs are not the most important reason for opposing sanctuary city policies. The real cost is not in taxpayer dollars but in the hundreds of thousands of crimes committed by individuals who should not be here in the first place. If we had secure borders and effective enforcement of all immigration, these criminal alien incarceration numbers would be very small. Yet, the fact that local governments hide these cost figures is symptomatic of the deeper problem. Too many local officials want all the political benefits of claiming to be the protector of “our immigrant community” while hiding the costs of protecting criminal aliens. Does your local sheriff publish the incarceration costs for criminal alien inmates in your local jail. Does he ever acknowledge the number of criminal aliens released from jail annually who are NOT turned over to federal immigration authorities because of local sanctuary policies? Does anyone on your local city council ever ask those questions? Some local politicians also use a phony “states rights” argument for resisting federal enforcement of immigration law. This is a phony argument because there is a long string of Supreme Court decisions, most recently the 2012 Arizona v. United States ruling by Justice Kennedy, saying that the Constitution in Article VI gives the federal government preemptive authority over immigration law. States cannot “ ’ of federal immigration law, and neither can cities or counties —   or universities or private religious organizations. While public attention has been focused on the   policies of the Obama administration, the truth is, even without official sanctuary policies established by mayors of local government, too many local sheriffs and police chiefs have been hiding behind an alleged “fear of liability” in not honoring the Detainer requests made by federal law enforcement, namely the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency —   known as ICE. ICE detainers are fully legal and should be  —   indeed, MUST be —   honored by local law enforcement agencies. Local sheriffs and police chiefs have no constitutional basis for refusing to honor ICE detainers. Citizens should hold local officials accountable when they refuse to obey the law. The Trump administration is making it clear that federal sanctions will be imposed  —   including the withholding of federal funds  —   from cities which want to disobey the law. But local citizens need not remain silent in this battle. Editor’s note: This article has been updated to note the figure for the cost to Colorado is $37, 958 rather than $27, 958."
An aspiring police officer who went undercover in a jail for 2 months describes why ’violence is almost necessary’ behind bars,"’  ’ ’   In jail, violence is always around the corner. ’ ”   Inmates strategically use fights to settle disputes and   climb the political ladder. And if   inexperienced inmates can’t adapt to their dangerous   surroundings, they’ll live in constant fear of another   beating. ” ’   That’’s what one participant on the A&E documentary   show ”60 Days In” learned during his stay at Clark County   Jail in Jeffersonville, Indiana. The show follows eight   volunteers who go undercover as inmates to expose problems   within the system. ’ ’   One of the volunteers, Ryan, observed that a strict social   hierarchy governed his pod of inmates. Fights broke   out between members of different social groups over   virtually any perceived slight  —   from spreading gossip or   talking too loudly at night to reneging on a deal to trade   hash browns.  ’ ’   Ryan, who did not use his last name on the show, further   explained what purpose violence serves behind bars: ’ ’   In some cases, clique leaders even arranged the fights as   calculated moves to address the shifting dynamics of the pod. ’ ’   ”If there is a white guy that happens to be in disagreement with   a Hispanic guy or a black guy, instead of those guys   fighting, which could potentially cause a race riot to just   break out, some other people would fight,” Ryan told Business   Insider. ”A black guy will fight the black guy or a white   guy would fight the white guy to prevent a lot of stuff from   going down.” ’ ’  ’ ’   Those higher on the ladder constantly test new inmates, according   to Ryan. A new inmate can gain trust by performing ”gofer”   tasks, like obtaining information from corrections officers   or collecting debts from other inmates, usually in the form of   food or commissary money. ’ ’   Inmates are sometimes asked to leave secret notes for officers or   other inmates, a practice known as ”flying a kite.” If they’’re   caught by members of a different social group, however the   consequences can be severe. ’ ’   ”There are internal groups that become judge, jury, and   executioner all rolled into one,” Ryan said. ”You’’re judged by a   jury of your peers, and violence is the sentence no matter   what. It’’s never like, ’’You owe me packs of ramen noodles. ’’   That’’s nothing.” ’ ”   Merely accepting the challenge of a fight is enough to earn the   respect of other inmates, regardless of the outcome, Ryan   explained. But refusing to participate is considered the   ultimate act of cowardice among inmates. Failure to adapt to the   jail’s unwritten rules can be devastating to an inmate’s   chances of a relatively peaceful stint behind bars. ” ’  ’ ’  ’ ’   Ryan, an aspiring police officer and former Army Reserve   medic, managed to avoid any physical confrontations during his   two months at Clark County Jail. He said he surprised his fellow   inmates with his experience in various martial arts,   including jiu jitsu and aikido, and because of his small   frame, became known as a ”sleeper.” ’ ’   ’ ’  ’ ’  ’"
U.K. Set to Choose Sharp Break From European Union - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   If British plans for leaving the European Union have been a dance of the seven veils, the British government removed one of them on Sunday, letting slip to news media that Prime Minister Theresa May is likely to choose to exit Europe’s single market and its customs union  —   a   hard Brexit. Mrs. May is scheduled to make a   speech on her plans on Tuesday, but the British weekend papers and Sunday news programs were briefed by Downing Street about the main lines of the policy, and some published selected quotations of what Mrs. May is scheduled to say. Officially, a government spokesman on Sunday called the reports “speculation” and emphasized only the extracts of the speech that were leaked by Downing Street itself, with Mrs. May calling for British unity “to make a success of Brexit and build a truly global Britain. ” Those extracts were not explicit on the single market or the customs union, but the Sunday newspapers, which receive their own briefings from the government before publication, took much the same line: that Britain is headed for a sharp break with Europe after a transitional period. Downing Street dislikes the term “hard Brexit,” but an outcome along those lines is not unexpected, because it flows logically from the priorities Mrs. May has set out, particularly about controlling the country’s borders. Being outside the single market could damage Britain’s important financial services sector and is likely to hit the value of the pound again, at least temporarily. A week ago, Mrs. May said in a television interview that   Britain would not be able to keep “bits” of its European Union membership. That, too, was interpreted as a break with the single market, which requires freedom of movement and labor for all citizens of the bloc. “Often people talk in terms as if somehow we are leaving the E. U. but we still want to kind of keep bits of membership,” she said then. “We are leaving. We are coming out. We are not going to be a member of the E. U. any longer. ” She added, “We will be able to have control of our borders, control of our laws. ” She and her officials have made it clear that her two main priorities are ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice over British law, and restoring British control over its borders and immigration, including from the European Union. Those decisions mean that Britain could no longer be a part of the single market for goods, capital, people and services of the European Union, because the rules for that market are adjudicated by the European Court of Justice. The situation is similar for the customs union, which applies only to goods. Membership in the customs union would mean that Britain would have to obey European Union regulations on manufacturing standards and would be banned from making separate trade deals with countries  —   two of the most important reasons   forces have cited for leaving the bloc. Another implication of leaving the single market and the customs union would be Britain’s desire to negotiate a new trade deal with the European Union as a special partner of some kind, but one different from those held by countries like Norway and Turkey. It would also seem to mean trying to negotiate a transitional deal with Brussels while the larger trade deal is being haggled out, which could take many years. Under a transitional deal, which would extend beyond the   limit for negotiating the exit, Britain would presumably continue to have a relationship much like the current one, including paying into the European Union’s budget. In an article in The Sunday Times of London, David Davis, the minister in charge of the new Department for Exiting the European Union, wrote that Britain would consider ways to extend or smooth the exit process to provide certainty for businesses. “If it proves necessary, we have said we will consider time for implementation of new arrangements,” he wrote. “We don’t want the E. U. to fail, we want it to prosper economically and politically, and we need to persuade our allies that a strong new partnership with the U. K. will help the E. U. to do that. ” In a combative interview published on Sunday, the chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, warned that, if no agreement could be reached on market access, Britain could change its economic model from “European style” taxation and regulation to regain competitiveness. “The British people are not going to lie down and say, ‘Too bad, we’ve been wounded,’” he said. “We will change our model and we will come back, and we will be competitively engaged. ” Those comments, from an interview with the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, were interpreted as a warning that Britain could use its corporate tax as a form of leverage in Brexit negotiations. In a television interview on Sunday, Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, said that Mr. Hammond “appears to be making a sort of threat to the European community,” calling it “a recipe for some kind of trade war with Europe in the future. ” But Mrs. May’s speech on Tuesday, judging from the excerpts, is also meant to assuage European Union colleagues by committing Britain to a close, friendly and constructive future relationship. Britain would prefer a   customs relationship with the European Union if one can be negotiated on British terms, which would mean limits on the bloc’s citizens working in Britain and the ability to do separate trade deals. European Union leaders have been largely dismissive of such efforts, but both sides are setting out hard positions before the real negotiations begin, sometime after Britain invokes Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to officially begin the process of leaving the bloc. Mrs. May insists that that will take place before the end of March, even if it requires a vote of Parliament, setting off two years of complicated talks on extracting Britain from a union it joined more than 40 years ago. Mr. Hammond is known to have argued strongly inside the government for Britain to keep its access to the single market to protect its financial sector, which accounts for 10 to 12 percent of Britain’s economic output. Bankers and brokers in the City of London are sometimes reviled by many Britons but are also highly paid, so their tax receipts are important to the Treasury. If a significant number of them moved their operations to European Union cities or New York, the pressure on the British government’s budget to pay for health care, pensions, welfare benefits and military spending would increase substantially. Britain already runs a significantly higher yearly deficit than most European countries, about 4. 4 percent of gross domestic product, and its cumulative debt is estimated at nearly 85 percent of G. D. P. Mainstream economists  —   under fire for wrongly predicting an immediate recession after the Brexit vote last June  —   say those figures are likely to worsen as the pound falls and the economy slows from the delayed effects of Brexit and the uncertainty around it. Mrs. May has also emphasized an interest in working with the incoming American administration of Donald J. Trump, and her government trumpeted its success in arranging a Washington meeting with the new president before the end of February. But her officials were not likely to be happy to discover that Michael Gove, who strongly favored Brexit and whom she fired from the cabinet, had secured the first British interview with Mr. Trump, scheduled to be printed in The Times of London on Monday. That interview comes after Mr. Trump had a series of meetings with Brexit advocates like Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U. K. Independence Party, and Arron Banks, who gave millions to fund UKIP and an alternative “Leave” campaign in the June referendum. Both men are expected to attend Mr. Trump’s inauguration."
"Man removed from flight after allegedly harassing Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner"," (CNN) JetBlue forced a man off a Thursday morning flight after an apparent incident involving Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, who was also aboard the plane. Matthew Lasner tweeted about the incident and said his husband was kicked off the flight from New York’s John F. Kennedy airport after a flight attendant overheard a man ”expressing displeasure” about   Donald Trump’s eldest daughter and her husband, who has become a key adviser to the incoming commander in chief. Another   tweet posted to Lasner’s account at 8:29 a. m. ET said, ”Ivanka and Jared at JFK TF, flying commercial. My husband chasing them down to harass them. #banalityofevil” Marc Scheff, who was seated in front of Trump on the plane, confirmed the incident in an interview with CNN’s Poppy Harlow on ”OutFront.” Scheff described the man as ”shaking” and ”visibly agitated.” According to Scheff, the man saw Trump and said, ”You ruined our country. Now you’re ruining our flight.” Asked about Trump’s response to the incident, Scheff said Ivanka told a JetBlue staff member, ”I don’t want to make this a thing.” What actually occurred is unclear, and Lasner’s entire Twitter account has since gone down, but it originally identified him as the author of a book on affordable housing in New York and a professor at Hunter College in New York City. A transition official said Trump and Kushner were headed to Hawaii for vacation. As of Thursday, the   remained in his Florida resort at    where he has spent the past several days. JetBlue said in a statement to CNN: ”The decision to remove a customer from a flight is not taken lightly. If the crew determines that a customer is causing conflict on the aircraft, the customer will be asked to deplane, especially if the crew feels the situation runs the risk of escalation during flight. In this instance, our team worked to reaccommodate the party on the next available flight.” A Trump Organization spokesman told CNN, ”The story speaks for itself. It’s an incredibly unfortunate situation.”"
Duterte: ’White Arab’ Islamic State Members Indoctrinating in Philippines,"Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte warned Wednesday of “white people, I suppose they are Arabs” looking to “indoctrinate” local populations in his country into radical Islam, and possibly working on behalf of the Islamic State (ISIS). Duterte announced a pay raise for all soldiers, ordering them to “destroy” Abu Sayyaf, a native jihadist group that has pledged allegiance to ISIS. [“Some parts of the islands of Mindanao, there are white people. I suppose they are Arabs, and they are here as missionaries,” Duterte said in a speech to the military Wednesday, referring to his native Mindanao, a southern island home to most of the nation’s Muslim minority. “They are not armed, but they are here for indoctrination, that’s what I’m afraid of. ”  “We have problems with Muslim insurgency, and we have to address them before they get contaminated by the ISIS disease,” he added. He predicted that, without significant pushback today, the Islamic State could establish a Caliphate in the Philippines, and the military’s job now “is to prevent the ISIS disease from contaminating the Moro [Muslim ethnic minority]. ” To that end, Duterte announced the eventual deployment of 20, 000 men to areas sensitive to Islamic State indoctrination. “Like communists, if they have established their influence, then that’s the time their political officers come in,” he noted, demanding the Philippine army work to ensure that Islamic radicals are unable to establish a foothold in Mindanao. Duterte also referenced Abu Sayyaf, a jihadist group active in Mindanao that has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State: “Destroy them, that’s an order. I see a looming problem, in three to seven years from now, we will have a problem with ISIS. ” Abu Sayyaf has been increasingly active in the past year, focusing its efforts on abducting foreigners and asking for ransom. Its members beheaded two hostages this year, and allegedly planned to abduct Manny Pacquiao, who is a Philippine senator, boxing champion, and vocal Christian. Philippine news outlets note that Duterte’s assertions that the Islamic State is recruiting in the Philippines contradict past police reports indicating there is no direct presence of Islamic State recruiters in the country. Local police chiefs have denied claims that ISIS is operating in their area, even when coming from local city officials or the local Muslim community. In March, before Duterte took office, members of the Islamic group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) warned in a public statement that ISIS had begun to deploy recruiters into their territory, though at the time, they had not “succeeded in establishing a stronghold in Mindanao. ” While MILF is an Islamic separatist group, it maintains friendly relations with Duterte, as he is the first president from the region in decades, and has made gestures of good will in support of Duterte’s war on drugs. Duterte has personal reasons to combat the spread of the Islamic State: reports that his enemies, notably those accused of drug trafficking, have reached out to ISIS jihadists looking to assassinate him. According to Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Ronald dela Rosa, at least one mayor in Mindanao accused of harboring drug traffickers has reached out to Islamic State jihadists in an attempt to negotiate a deal to assassinate Duterte. “We are seriously looking at this threat,” dela Rosa asserted on Philippine television station  . Duterte’s defining campaign promise was to eradicate drug crime from the Philippines, as the nation finds itself trapped by an unprecedented epidemic of methamphetamine addiction, reportedly affecting millions. Methamphetamine, or “shabu” as it is locally known, has become the nation’s most prized drug market, which Duterte says has for years been enabled by police, military, and public servants willing to overlook crime in exchange for kickback payments."
Anthony Weiner Thinks He’s Pretty Good at Giving Advice - The New York Times,"What is your job now? I don’t have one, really. I’ve got a consulting company with a handful of clients  —   a couple of nonprofits, a universe of businesses and executives whose instincts are good. Sometimes they just want to kibitz. During the week of the Democratic National Convention, you appeared on both Stephen Colbert’s and Bill Maher’s shows. What’s your current philosophy on media exposure? I’m more experiential. When you do media as an elected official or as a candidate, you have a very clear message that you’re trying to impart and an idea of who you’re talking to. Now I don’t have all that. It’s more just to say what I think. You’re an unusual public figure in that you are known as a former member of Congress and candidate for mayor  —   and now you’re a guy who had an embarrassing sex scandal featured in a recent documentary. Do people approach you differently? The interactions I have with people have gotten clouded lately because of the movie. The movie seems very much to be a Rorschach test of what people thought about the thing itself. Some people approach me, and they’re like, “Oh, you got a raw deal. ” Some people approach me saying, “Oh, man, I wish you hadn’t messed up. ” Some people approach me and say, “Man, you are such an idiot. ” Have you or your wife, Huma Abedin, seen it? No. Do you regret giving access to the filmmakers? Obviously, when I agreed to do the movie, I anticipated a different outcome. Does anything hurt your feelings anymore or are you kind of immunized by what you’ve been through? To some degree, the same thing that made me successful and that allowed me to survive stuff is that my emotional wiring isn’t fully connected. I have a very thick skin. Without going down a rabbit hole here, you could argue that some of my emotional wiring wasn’t working terribly well. That is how I can survive having 40 cameras outside my house. Are you still engaging in the activities that got you in trouble? I’m not going to go down the path of talking about any of that. But I will say this: There’s no doubt that the Trump phenomenon has led a lot of people to say to me, “Boy, compared to inviting the Russians to come hack someone’s email, your thing seems almost quaint. ” I would think a great number of your former Republican colleagues in Congress must have some regrets about what’s really going on in their party, but most of them can’t say anything. Do you think that might change now that the conventions are behind us? No. The reason they don’t say anything is because they think it fractures their base. But I’m far enough away from this that I doubt my judgment. Recently, you said that if Donald Trump Jr. ran for mayor of New York, you might run yourself, just so you could beat him “like a rented mule. ” I never understood that expression. Why would a rented mule get beaten worse than a regular mule? I don’t know. I grew up listening to Don Imus, who would use that expression all the time. It’s colorful. Do you miss politics? I always had this philosophy when I was an elected official that I shouldn’t be a pundit, but now I’m called upon to be one every once in a while. Notwithstanding the flames I went down in, I’m pretty good at this stuff. Have you thought about running campaigns or being a political consultant? Almost weekly, some candidate will call and ask for advice. I’ve weirdly become a little bit of an elder statesman. Shouldn’t you get paid for it then? No, I don’t want to make a life out of it. Also, no one would want me. Why not? Would you really want the distraction of having me as your campaign manager?"

"Dog the Bounty Hunter and Beth Blast Christie, Bless Clarke - Breitbart","Duane “Dog” and Beth Chapman from the reality TV shows Dog the Bounty Hunter and Dog and Beth: On the Hunt were guests in the Breitbart News Daily studios on Tuesday, talking about how the justice system had been under attack during the Obama administration and how they believe it is on the mend in the era of Donald Trump. [STRANAHAN: When you’re talking about this bail reform movement, what it means, and of course stop me if I’m wrong and tell me if I’m exaggerating  —   but it means in some cases criminals are being brought in and put right back on the street. BETH: Within minutes. DOG: Within minutes. BETH: Literally the police officers are still inside doing paperwork when the perpetrator is basically let out the door. DOG: Alleged perpetrator. BETH: Mmmmm, okay, alleged. STRANAHAN: And so when we’re talking about the dismantlement of law and order under Obama, this is what I’m talking about. BETH: Yeah. There’s no teeth, law enforcement’s hands are basically tied. I think they’re far more reluctant to even arrest anybody because it takes them, like I said, more time to do the paperwork then it does to bring them down. But the bigger issue is there’s no accountability and there’s no deterrent, there’s no repercussion, there’s no one looking for these people when they fail to appear. Basically, they’re going to be clogging up the docket so bad there’ll be no efficiency whatsoever in our court systems. Christie went out and he duped his entire state basically and said, “This is only gonna cost a couple of million dollars. ” The cost is so expensive now, it’s over $22 million. Most of the counties can’t even afford to implement this policy, and they’ve got small business people dying on the vine there and it’s counterproductive to the economy. STRANAHAN: And how is letting those criminals back out on the streets working out for the poor? DOG: Well of course the poor will be poor, but they’re stealing trying to get money. BETH: But they’re releasing them back into the poor communities. They’re not releasing them into our communities. So in reality he’s   the very people that he claims to be helping. One topic discussed was the   “Parole Reform Movement,” which they say was bankrolled by billionaire institutional left funder George Soros, as well as leading libertarian funders the Koch Brothers. The ideologically driven approach to belittle justice has resulted in a revolving door for criminals, said the two bail enforcement agents.  BETH: The Koch Brothers, the Arnold Foundation, The Manhattan Project, the Innocence Project, you know there’s a lot of groups donating quite a bit of money into these things. Harvard donated $1 million, which is very disturbing to me  —   a school of high learning and you think that they would understand that, again, people aren’t in jail because they’re poor. And basically the most unnerving thing about this whole thing, that we have taken away the voice of the victims. The victims absolutely have no voice  —   and they have no protection. They think that these guys are gonna go to jail and they’re gonna stay in jail, and they’re safe at least for the night  —   but not in New Jersey. DOG: And we’re not talking about graffiti or urinating in public  —   none of that. We’re talking about first degree burglary, domestic violence, rape of an intoxicated person. BETH:  —   giving a gun to a known gang member  …     As an example of this ideological influence, take Katharine Huffman, Board Chair of the bail reform movement group Justice Policy Institute, whose biography says: Ms. Huffman began her legal career as a   litigator and Soros Justice Fellow at the Southern Center for Human Rights in Atlanta, Georgia. Dog and Beth had harsh words for former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie: BETH: Christie’s been awful. He has drank the   obviously. But, he’s destroying New Jersey. And not that New Jersey was   to begin with, but now it’s so overrun with crime that you got police chiefs coming out, lieutenants coming out, you got Facebook popping up New Jersey’s bail reform failures. There are so many people so concerned. There was a police chief that basically came out and told his citizens, “I can’t keep you safe. I have to let these guys go by mandate. ” And you get Christie on the line about it, or you get him on any type of a radio show or whatever, and he tries to blame the bail bondsman and say, “They’ve been picking on the poor  …    ” If they’re poor, then how could they afford the bail bondsman to begin with? On the other hand, they had high praise for Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, who was recently a speaker at the closing day of CPAC. Dog and Beth both appreciate Clarke’s approach to law and order, which they see as in line with the Trump presidency. MARLOW: So let’s get into your connection with Sheriff Clarke. You’ve been a big advocate for him, he’s considering a Senate bid, talk to us about that. DOG: Sheriff Clarke is strong law and order. A very fair man. He’s been the Sheriff of Milwaukee for many years, and we love him. And when you get that way, you go to one mountain and you get to the top, there’s another mountain to climb. So he’s the toughest Sheriff, he’s strong law and order. He needs not just to be in one state we need him nationally. Breitbart News recently recorded exclusive video interviews with Dog and Beth that will be the centerpiece of several stories related to the Bail Reform Movement by Breitbart lead investigative reporter Lee Stranahan. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. "
Trump traffics in conspiracy theories ," (CNN) The President of the United States traffics in conspiracy theories. Donald Trump has brought the art of blaming dark forces for the events taking place in our world to the highest levels of power.  On Saturday, as he  confronted the political crisis unfolding as a result of his advisers’ contacts with Russian officials    during the time that the intelligence agencies agree the Russians were systematically intervening in the election    he found someone else to blame. ”How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is  . Bad (or sick) guy!” he tweeted.  In another tweet he wrote: ”I’d bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!” The source of his accusations perhaps were broadcasts by the conservative talk show hosts Mark Levin and Rush Limbaugh, as well as a story on Breitbart by Joel Pollak. There is no evidence to support the wiretapping claim and Obama’s spokesman, along with former members of his administration, have denied it. Conspiracy theories have always been part of American politics. The historian Richard Hofstadter famously made this a central part of the study of American politics. He best captured this thesis in his 1964 Harper’s Magazine article, ”The Paranoid Style in American Politics,” where he wrote about the ways in which conspiracy theories had been used by various political movements throughout U. S. history.  A historian who was writing in the middle of the McCarthyism of the 1950s and watching the rise of the Radical Right in Republican Barry Goldwater’s presidential campaign, Hofstadter was interested in this underside of conservatism. ”American politics has often been an arena for angry minds,” Hofstadter started his piece by saying. For the ”paranoid spokesman,” Hofstadter wrote, ”The enemy is clearly delineated: he is a perfect model of malice, a kind of amoral superman    sinister, ubiquitous, powerful, cruel, sensual,  .” This is how Trump likes to explain the world. It is not a surprise that he made his political name in 2011 and 2012 by moving to the forefront of the Birther Movement, which falsely argued that President Obama wasn’t really  . We don’t know whether Trump believed in the birther cause or not. And we don’t know if he really believes Obama wiretapped him, or whether the President is really as paranoid as he sounds.   But what we have seen without question is that he employs the language of conspiracy as a way to make his case to the public. Trump’s entire presidential campaign revolved around several alleged massive conspiracies: ”Crooked Hillary,” as he called his opponent, had used secret private emails to discuss classified information and hidden her actions from the public. The entire media was ”rigged,” he said, trying to throw the election to the Democrats even as he enjoyed endless airtime and coverage for his every statement. During the final days of the campaign he turned Bernie Sanders’s populist critique    the way that financial and economic policies hurt the poor    into an    campaign ad that showed the faces of some prominent Jewish officials along with a speech about the global economic elite. Trump continues to use the media as a foil, now blaming them for pouring out ”fake news” that covers up every one of his alleged accomplishments    from the crowd size at his inauguration, to the ”real” outcome of the election, to his policy ”success” in the First Hundred Days. Trump appointed Michael Flynn to be his National Security Advisor even though Flynn had regularly retweeted all sorts of conspiracy theories that came from crackpot broadcasters and social media contributors. Trump argued that the press has refused to cover terrorist attacks He hinted of horrors in Sweden that never happened. He has accused refugees of flooding onto the U. S. shores with the intention of conducting massive terrorist attacks against the country.  He has often picked up on the claims of conspiracy theory guru Alex Jones, a radio host who operates on the fringes of politics. As protesters confront Republican legislators in town hall meetings about ACA, Trump blames the ”liberal activists” for being behind the fury.  He even told Fox and Friends that President Obama was to blame for the backlash. The President has sometimes given a silent nod to conspiracy theorists, such as when he removed references to Jews on Holocaust Remembrance Day despite the recommendations of the State Department. Doing so played directly into the hands of those who have claimed that the Jewish community somehow invented this massacre against them.  The use of conspiracy by the President of the United States as a central part of his discourse is extraordinarily dangerous. By doing so President Trump gives credence and legitimacy to these kinds of arguments which generate anger and distrust, as well as total misinformation    in this case making an unfounded accusation against a former president of the United States.  Ironically, he is employing a main strategy of McCarthyism at the very time he is claiming to be a victim of those kinds of tactics.  His focus on conspiracy also turns his attention away from the serious political issues that the nation faces. As he capitalized on in the campaign, the middle class is hurting economically and there are serious national security threats confronting the nation and our allies. Yet Trump is so consumed with exposing the ”true” stories that are being covered up    even why former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is leaving ”The Apprentice”    that he is letting the time that Republicans have to accomplish something with united government quickly slip away.  Over the past couple of weeks, particularly as it relates to Russiagate, there have been more political figures willing to call out Trump and his administration and challenge the way he is performing in office. But it won’t be easy to fight his conspiratorial approach. As Hofstadter explained, this kind of rhetoric has deep roots in American history and now there is a President who embraces, rather than pushes back against this tradition, making it challenging for his opponents to engage in rational arguments and to try to win policy debates based on the facts. Of course, if there was a wiretap the story would probably be even worse for Trump. As the New York Times reported, that would mean that a federal judge had concluded that the Justice Department found enough evidence to believe there was probable cause Trump might be guilty of a major crime or breach of national security.  In a tumultuous world, it is always tempting for people to argue that there are evil forces who are manipulating events. In this case, however, the person who is making those kinds of irresponsible claims is the head of the American government. The President is not speaking truth to the people. And in light of that reality, the health of our democracy is at risk."

Zika-Linked Mosquitoes ’Infesting’ Orange County - Breitbart,"Aggressive tropical mosquitos —  a breed that can carry the Zika virus —  are “infesting” Orange County, California, authorities warn. [The invasive species —  which can also carry yellow fever, dengue fever and chinungunya —  could pose a risk to the public.  None of the mosquitoes in question has yet been found to be carrying Zika, but could provide a vector for its transmission. Authorities recently admitted that there have been six Zika cases in the last three years in California, and that the mosquitos responsible for Zika have been found in 12 of the 58 counties in California. Aedes aegypti, or yellow fever mosquitos, were reported in Orange County last October. The Orange County Mosquito and Vector Control District (OCMVCD) stated at the time that the mosquitos had been found in Anaheim earlier in the year, but had not been seen since an area resident’s April 2015 report. “The Yellow Fever mosquito is a small but aggressive   species,” the OCMVCD wrote, in a flyer urging the public’s assistance. “The Yellow Fever mosquito breeds in small containers, particularly the types of container found in residential yards. We are asking you to call Orange County Mosquito and Vector Control District at (714)   if you are bitten during the day by a mosquito. ” Rober Cummings with the OCMVCD told Fox 11 local news in an interview that the yellow fever mosquito looks different than local Orange County mosquitos, which tend to be brown. The   mosquitos are black and white striped. An October warning from the OCMVCD stated: The yellow fever mosquito is recognizable by its bright silver   marking and white banded legs. They can live both indoors and outdoors, and primarily bite humans. Female mosquitoes lay their eggs in containers holding as little as a teaspoon of water, and eggs, which are laid just above the water line, can survive dry conditions for six months or more. The   insect was “first identified in California’s central valley and central coast in June of 2013, and last year in Los Angeles County,” according to the OCMVCD. “it is generally accepted that the transportation of dormant eggs attached to items such as imported tires and plants, is commonly associated with introductions of this mosquito species. ” It remains unconfirmed whether the rapidly spreading Zika virus actually causes birth defect microcephaly, but the World Health Organization (WHO) this week declared a global emergency over the virus. There has however, been a spike in the “small head” birth defect in Brazin since discovery of the virus there last year. An estimated 80 per cent of cases don’t produce symptoms in those stricken according to the Associated Press. There is currently no known treatment for the virus.

Donald Trump’s election has the Philippine president singing a different tune,"’  ’ ’   Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has been in office for just   a few months, but he has made clear his opinion of the current US   president, calling Obama a ”” ahead of a regional summit in   September. ’ ’   Duterte expressed regret, and the  on the sidelines of that   event. ’ ”   But the   relationship has continued to be strained   by Duterte’s rhetoric and his hostility to the longstanding   political and military relationship between the two countries. ” ’   Duterte, however, seems keen on the US  . ’ ’   On Wednesday,  during a visit to Malaysia,   Duterte said, ”I would like to congratulate President   Trump,” before declaring amid cheers, ”Long live, Mr. Trump! We   both curse at the slightest of reasons. We are alike.” ’ ’  ’ ”   Duterte’s   trip to Malaysia had something of a festive   air.  ” ’   Duterte  a karaoke rendition of Bette Midler’’s   ”Wind Beneath My Wings” and  a karaoke duet with Malaysian Prime   Minister Najib Razak, belting out ”   ” a hit   from the 1970s by Danish group The Walkers. ’ ’  ’ ’   Public singing is something of past time in the Philippines, and   karaoke machines are common  in Filipino homes.  to The New York Times, Duterte was   sometimes seen in the karaoke bars of Davao City, the   southern Philippine city where he was mayor for much of the last   30 years, where  belt out Frank Sinatra songs   while packing a . 38 pistol. ’ ”   The official statement released by Duterte’s office was more   measured than his comments in Malaysia, but it still expressed   more warmth than many of Duterte’s comments about the   US in the past. ” ’   ”The United States’’ presidential elections is a testament to the   enduring traditions of its democratic system and the American way   of life,” the statement,  by the Presidential Communications   Office, read. ’ ’   ”The   system gives American voters freedom of choice   based on party platforms, not just on personalities,” it went on,   : ’ ’  ’ ’   Many have noted the  in the personalities and   pronouncements of Duterte and Trump, and Trump has drawn  to the Philippine leader   throughout his campaign. ’ ”   Despite Duterte’s enthusiasm about Trump’s election, the mood   among Philippine policymakers has been mixed. ” ”   Duterte’s advisers, like their counterparts  looked at the   looming Trump presidency with more uncertainty. ” ’   “Candidates and presidents are two different people. So we will   …       have to wait and see what policies a Trump presidency will   implement” Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez said this week,    to   News. ’ ’   The Philippines, where an  labor force is available for   lower wages than those demanded in the US, has grown in appeal    and been the recipient of   many outsourced jobs in recent years. ’ ”   Trump’s promises to return to the US jobs that have gone abroad   has stirred  in the Philippines, as have his   promises to crackdown on immigration, which could affect the flow   of remittances. ” ”   In the face of that   uncertainty, however, some in   the Philippines have heralded Duterte’s turn to China. ” ’  ’ ’   ”We have a safety net   …     [Duterte] foresaw that there’s this   likelihood of Trump becoming president, so he decided to pivot to   China,” Ernesto Pernia, the director general of the Philippine   National Economic and Development Authority, said,  to   News. ”Instead of   depending on the US to a great extent, we are now diversifying   our friends.” ’ ”   Others are less confident in the Philippines’ economic position   between the Asian and American giants. ” ’   Joey Salceda, a member of the Philippine House of Representatives   and an economist,  that the US economy still   outstrips the Chinese economy, and Manila would have no choice   but to deal with Washington. ’ ’   ”The protectionism applies does not only to the trade, but it   also applies to the flow of new ideas and new technology,”   Salceda . ”So it’s very negative for the world,   very negative for the Philippines.” ’"
Peruvian Cardinal Slams UN as ‘Modern-Day Herod’ for Pushing Abortion During Zika Crisis - Breitbart,"The Peruvian Cardinal Juan Luis Cipriani, archbishop of Lima, has blasted the United Nations for encouraging Latin American governments affected by the Zika virus to allow abortion, comparing the organization to a   King Herod, who ordered the slaughter of babies at the time of Jesus’ birth. [The outspoken cardinal recalled that when Herod heard of the birth of the Messiah “since he didn’t know what to do and was an animal he said ‘let’s kill all the boys under two years of age,’ so they killed all the boys in and around Bethlehem. ”  “Today we are surrounded by Herods, but Herods with neckties, public posts and budgets,” he lamented, pointing out that “the United Nations, in the face of this Zika mosquito virus, has decreed that we should approve abortion everywhere so as to kill the children. ” The cardinal was responding to a recent UN appeal that Latin American countries give women access to abortions because of possible ties between the ongoing Zika virus outbreak in the region and the    incidence of microcephaly in Brazilian babies. “How can they ask these women not to become pregnant, but not offer   …     the possibility to end their pregnancies?” asked UN Human Rights office spokeswoman Cecile Pouilly. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein was similarly forceful in calling for a relaxation of abortion laws. “The laws and policies that restrict access to these services should be urgently reviewed in accordance with human rights, in order to ensure, in practice, the right to health for all,” he said. In his weekly radio program, the Peruvian cardinal was having none of it, saying, “I cannot keep quiet” in the face of abortion activists pushing for these policies. “There is a Herod,” he repeated, “who thinks it’s a good idea to decree an execution: let all pregnant women abort their babies because of a risk that hasn’t even been conclusively shown. But in case of doubt, kill them all,” he said. The cardinal said that when something as sacred as human life has been devalued, it is no surprise that “corruption, insult and assassination” follow. Recently the Ministry of Health of El Salvador, one of the countries most affected by the Zika epidemic, reported that 13 women infected with the Zika virus had given birth to perfectly healthy babies with no trace of microcephaly. The Washington Post has also noted that Colombia has 3, 177 pregnant women who suffered from Zika infections, yet there was not a single reported case of microcephaly. Recent reports suggest that alleged connections between the Zika virus and microcephaly in Brazilian babies may be due more to hype and hysteria than serious science. Only 4% of the 404 cases of microcephaly in Brazil coincided with Zika infections, meaning that there must be another cause or causes to explain the higher incidence of children born with microcephaly in the country. The tenuous ties between Zika and microcephaly have not stopped abortion activists like Planned Parenthood from trying to exploit the crisis to push Latin American governments to remove all restrictions on abortion. “It’s amazing how fast they have acted, not decreeing a campaign, economic aid or an investigation,” Cardinal Cipriani said in his broadcast, “but rather that all Latin American countries allow abortion to combat this danger,” he said. “We really have to be sick at heart to do such a thing,” he added.

Abortion Pill Orders Rise in 7 Latin American Nations on Zika Alert - The New York Times,"Orders for abortion pills by women in seven Latin American countries with Zika outbreaks increased after health officials in those countries warned that the virus might cause severe birth defects, according to a women’s organization supplying such pills. Orders from women in Brazil, Ecuador and Venezuela roughly doubled, while those from Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras went up by from 36 percent to 76 percent, researchers said in a study published Wednesday by The New England Journal of Medicine. The authors of the study included a leader of the group based in Amsterdam that is supplying the pills, Women on Web, a nonprofit staffed by doctors helping women from countries where abortion is illegal or restricted to terminate unwanted pregnancies. Even with the increase in demand for abortion pills, the number of orders received by Women on Web from Latin America and the Caribbean in that time period was small: slightly more than 2, 300 in the region, with about 1, 600 of those in countries where health authorities had warned about Zika’s potential to cause brain damage. In the countries where Zika warnings were issued, there are typically about 3. 5 million abortions per year, said Gilda Sedgh, the principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research organization which was not involved in the study. So, Dr. Sedgh said, “The increase in demand for abortion observed by the authors in countries affected by Zika could be spurious because Women on Web accounts for a small share of all abortions in that part of the world. ” The numbers could be “an early warning sign” of increased demand for abortion because of Zika, Dr. Sedgh said, adding that it is also possible that Women on Web “might have experienced an increase in demand as a result of increased visibility of their services when health advisories were issued. ” Access to abortion has been a contentious issue for years in many of the countries affected by Zika, but Zika has brought fresh attention to the debate. In Latin America and the Caribbean, according to a recent study, there are about 6. 5 million abortions each year. Most of them are illegal, and an estimated 750, 000 women a year are treated for complications from unsafe abortions in the region, Dr. Sedgh said. Women’s rights groups have long pressed for abortion restrictions to be eased. The study looked at orders for pills between Nov. 17, 2015, when the Pan American Health Organization issued an alert saying Zika virus might be linked to a surge in infants born with tiny heads and damaged brains in Brazil, and March 2 of this year. It compared actual orders to the number that would have been expected based on orders during the previous five years. Women on Web has a history of defying legal restrictions in such countries, which sometimes block access to its website or seize the packages it sends. The nonprofit also asks women unable to pay for their prescription to write an email explaining why they needed the abortion pill and could not afford it. “Some of the emails that came in were heartbreaking,” said Dr. Abigail R. A. Aiken, a reproductive health researcher at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Austin, and the lead author of the study. “The fear and desperation was really hard to read. ” A woman from Venezuela wrote, “I contracted Zika 4 days ago,” adding: “I love children. But I don’t believe it is a wise decision to keep a baby who will suffer. I need an abortion. I don’t know who to turn to. Please help me ASAP!” An email from a woman in Colombia said, “Here Zika is a major problem and the health authorities do not help with it. ” She added: “I have no resources at this time and want to ask for your help because fear overwhelms me. What if the baby is born sick? !” Even more than it has increased attention on restrictive abortion laws, the Zika crisis has highlighted the issues of access to contraception and ways that women are   about birth control or discouraged from using it in some of the countries. In the face of Zika, some countries have been working to increase the availability and use of contraception. Women on Web is an offshoot of Women on Waves, which was founded in 1999 by Dr. Rebecca Gomperts. Women on Waves originally sailed a Dutch boat to countries that outlawed abortion, took women on board and performed abortions outside a nation’s territorial waters. As internet access in poor countries increased, Dr. Gomperts began supplying mifepristone and misoprostol pills, a combination approved by the World Health Organization for abortion in the first 10 weeks of a pregnancy. The Women on Web site is posted in five languages and tops Google search results for “I need an abortion. ”"
Acting US ambassador to China resigns  ,"Washington (CNN) Acting US ambassador to China David Rank resigned from his post in Beijing over President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, several sources familiar with the decision told CNN.   A career foreign service officer since 1990, Rank assumed the position of deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Beijing in January 2016 and had been serving as charge d’affaires until the arrival of Trump’s pick for the job, former Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, who was confirmed by Congress late last month. ”Dave is exactly the type of diplomat any American would want representing their interests abroad, and he was sought after within the State Department for increasingly difficult and challenging assignments because he’s strategic, smart, savvy, curious, loyal and ” said Dan Feldman, who worked with Rank for five years on Afghan issues.   ”Given he spent much of his career seeking to strengthen the   relationship to benefit all Americans, we need his expertise and skills now more than ever before,” he said. ”It’s   that we’re losing career officers of his talent, as they pride themselves on serving any administration, but some are increasingly grappling with whether they must take principled decisions as they balance their sense of duty with their conscience.”   Rank has served in several senior positions within the US State Department including time as the director of the office of Afghanistan affairs and as a senior adviser to the special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan. ”Mr. Rank made a personal decision,” a senior State Department official told CNN, stopping short of citing the climate deal developments as the reason. ”We appreciate his years of dedicated service to the State Department.” But sources familiar with the decision indicated that Rank’s departure is directly tied to Trump’s controversial move to pull out of the accord. One source familiar with Rank’s decision to resign said that Rank addressed his staff on Monday and talked about his four tours in China and how much he loved the country. But he said this weekend he was asked to do something which ”as a parent, patriot and Christian, I simply cannot do.”  Rank, according to the source, told the embassy staff he couldn’t in good conscience do anything that would contribute to the implementation of the decision to withdraw from the climate agreement. He said he looked for a way to avoid a conflict between his duty and conscience but when he couldn’t find one, he offered to resign, assuming his resignation would be accepted. And it was accepted.  Rank was serving in China when President Xi Jinping and   President Barrack Obama jointly declared their commitment to the Paris agreement.  China, the world’s largest carbon emitter, said it would stick by its commitments to the treaty despite the US decision. Rank becomes the second US diplomat serving at one of the largest embassies in the world to publicly split with Trump in recent days.  The acting US ambassador to the United Kingdom, Lewis Lukens, issued a statement on Twitter singling out London Mayor Sadiq Khan for praise after Trump attacked him on Twitter in the wake of the terror attacks which killed at least seven people. ”I commend the strong leadership of the @MayorofLondon as he leads the city forward after this heinous attack,” read a tweet from the US’ London embassy attributed to Lukens. Trump appeared to misconstrue a statement made by Khan after the attack in London, writing on Twitter: ”At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ”no reason to be alarmed!”  Lukens is serving as ambassador until Trump gets a permanent pick confirmed. Trump has yet to formally nominate his choice for the job, although he said prior to his inauguration that he would choose New York Jets owner Woody Johnson."
"$50,000 Ticket for NBA Finals Game 7 Breaks StubHub Record","A $50, 000 ticket for Sunday’s Game 7 of the NBA Finals has broken StubHub’s record for the highest price ever paid to see a basketball game. [Actually, that’s two tickets: the customer bought a pair for one hundred grand.  And that new record could still be broken: other seats for the historic game on Father’s Day at the Oracle Arena in Oakland are advertised for even higher prices. Local San Francisco Bay Area CBS News affiliate KPIX reports: “One guy has tickets posted for $214, 000 each,” says Golden State Warriors spokesperson Brandon Schneider. “I don’t know if anyone is going to buy that, but I have seen that. ” The Warriors will host the Cleveland Cavaliers, who have overcome a   deficit over the past two games to force a   tie and a decisive Game 7. Golden State compiled the most dominant regular season record in the history of the NBA, going   breaking the record previously held by Michael Jordan’s Chicago Bulls in the   season. However, Stephen Curry and his crew have stumbled in the playoffs  —   first surviving a nasty scare in the Western Conference Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder, and then squandering a huge lead in the Finals. On the Cleveland side, star player LeBron James is attempting to overcome a reputation for choking in the playoffs, and to vindicate his decision to leave the Miami Heat for his former hometown team. Tech wizards have warmed to Golden State in recent years, especially given the team’s reliance on “moneyball”   play that emphasizes perimeter shooting over    muscle. But LeBron has something to prove. And everyone in the Bay Area wants to be there. Game time: 5:00 p. m. Pacific  —   for free on ABC. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

Why billionaire Steve Ballmer spent $10 million to build a free — and strangely patriotic — website,"’’ ”It’s been said we’re living in  where people choose to ignore facts or believe lies that challenge their own worldview.” ”Steve Ballmer, the billionaire former CEO of Microsoft and current NBA Clippers team owner, isn’t buying it.” ”That’s why he wrote $10 million worth of personal checks to create a free website called USAFacts. org, ” ’The site takes government data from 70 different government sources to create a financial report on the government. It makes it easy to find out everything, from how much taxes we all really pay to crime and divorce rates.’ ’Ballmer says the idea for the site has nothing to do with one political party or another, but everything to do with state of politics in general.’ ’”It’’s not a political site, but I hope it plays a role,” he told Business Insider. ”I am partisan for facts themselves. ”’ ”He says today’s political environment feels like a sports event, where everyone is rooting for their own team and against the other team  —   and that’s inherently dangerous.” ’”A sports game is easy. Somebody wins, somebody loses, and that’’s OK. But that’’s not how it should be in this country,” he says. ”In politics, unlike sports, everybody needs to arrive at a common conclusion and we all live with the conclusion. ”’ ”In other words, the same laws govern us all, no matter which team championed it. And there’s a reason to hope that Ballmer is onto to something and people still do care deeply about facts, even if we all have different opinions about what to do about them.” ”When the site officially launched in April, Ballmer didn’t know what the response would be, if anyone would care. But the day it launched, the site was so overwhelmed with traffic that the traffic crashed the site for hours. In its first 48 hours, USAFacts. org chalked up more than half a million visitors and 2 million page views.

"MILO: President Trump, Here’s Why You Must Cut Federal Funding From UC Berkeley - Breitbart","In 1969, Governor Ronald Reagan of California was met with a problem that will sound familiar to those who were following my college tour last week: batshit crazy leftists rioting at UC Berkeley. [Reagan’s answer was to send in the National Guard, armed with buckshot and batons. Contrast this with Berkeley’s more recent approach, which was to give professor and former Labor Secretary Robert Reich a platform to spew a hysterical conspiracy theory in which Breitbart and I hired domestic terrorists to beat up my own fans and the residents of Berkeley and smash up Bank of America ATMs, Starbucks and trashcans.  But back to Reagan. He then gave a news conference, where, in Daddyesque fashion, he slapped down members of the media for encouraging the lawlessness. GOAT. Reagan knew how to handle lawless rioters. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 pic. twitter.   —   Rita Panahi (@RitaPanahi) November 12, 2016,  The good news for President Trump and others interested in maintaining law and order in the face of leftist anarchy is that police   has advanced since the 1960s, and there is no need to send in the National Guard with shotguns, as Reagan did, which ended up killing one student. In the   century, pepper spray and foam cannons can accomplish the same job without fatalities. And there’s even better news. There’s a way to defeat protests without buckshot, foam cannons, or pepper spray. A way to beat them before they even begin. It’s simple: defund UC Berkeley, and any other campus that encourages the mad, radical politics that is now causing violence on America’s streets on a daily basis. The Department of Education largely controls the   of American colleges. At UC Berkeley last year, federal funding came to $370 million  —   more than half the university’s budget. Colleges fear the withdrawal of federal funds so much that when the Obama administration merely hinted at doing so in 2011 over the largely fabricated “campus rape epidemic,” it led to one of the greatest outbreaks of panic and miscarriages of justice in American history, as colleges set up kangaroo courts which frequently expelled students for sexual assault based on threadbare evidence. The left are well aware of the existential threat they face. That’s why it’s Betsy DeVos  —   and not, say, Jeff Sessions  —   who is facing the toughest confirmation hearing. Jeff Sessions is important, of course, and will no doubt do extraordinary work in foiling the mad globalist dream of open borders, but it’s what Trump might do in education that really strikes terror into the hearts of the left. Higher education is their ideological breeding ground the mad leftist displays that you see in Hollywood and Silicon Valley start on college campuses. Sessions is a problem for the left on a number of fronts, notably law and order and immigration. But if DeVos is bold and aggressive enough, she could tear out the beating heart of leftist power  —   college ideological indoctrination. If colleges were effectively   by DeVos, the left would take generations to recover. At this point, some libertarians  —   like the American party’s cretinous chairman  —   will be clutching their pearls at the thought of using the federal government to influence colleges. Once again (and this is why the right and why libertarians so often lose) they fail to grasp the cultural libertarian argument  —   libertarian ideals will come to nothing in a culture that doesn’t respect liberty. This is what the ‘do what you want, just leave me in peace to mine bitcoin and smoke weed’ faction of libertarianism  —   I. e. most libertarians  —   don’t understand. A similar argument obtains when talking about protecting the first amendment from sources of hostility to free speech, such as Islam, feminism and most of the media. And where are cultural values incubated? Colleges, of course! As long as campuses are churning out students who hate free speech and free markets, what hope is there for libertarian policy priorities? If libertarians want to live in a free society, they’d better get ready to tread on their opponents. At my UC Berkeley show last week,   set college property on fire, smashed up bank windows and ATMs, jumped on people’s cars, and looted downtown stores, including the   liberal Starbucks. They also assaulted dozens of my fans, who were falsely accused of being “Nazis. ” The San Francisco Chronicle reports that   rioters caused around $600, 000 in damages that night, with the riot starting at the college before spreading to downtown Berkeley. $600, 000. That’s an awful lot of money for a communist tantrum. The day after, my tour bus was tracked and my hotel location was leaked online.   Berkeley activists took out the remainder of their frustration on the bus, which was vandalized with spray paint. Following the chaos, only one suspect was arrested, and celebrities, the mainstream media, the Mayor of Berkeley, and UC Berkeley administrators blamed the damage on me —   a homosexual conservative who was unable to deliver a speech because students, brainwashed by their Marxist professors, decided to set their campus on fire. For decades, the university campus has been a hotbed of dogma, brainwashing generation after generation in the most fashionable and foolhardy leftist ideas of the day. From professors offering extra credit to attend   rallies to courses on “The Problem of Whiteness,” leftists on campus are teaching younger generations how to hate. Is it any wonder that they then go around smashing windows and punching people in the face? And if that isn’t bad enough, these thugs are absolutely terrible at identifying their ideological enemies  —   according to the account of Malini Ramaiyer in the New York Times, one person called a “Nazi” and assaulted was a Syrian Muslim student. Oops! Who could have predicted training young people to attack instead of argue could turn out badly? And by the way, if you’re a NYT or Buzzfeed or CNN journalist ‎reading this, you’re to blame too, for creating an environment in which it’s okay to call conservatives Nazis and white supremacists. What did you think was going to happen? The current atmosphere is also terrible for college students themselves. They’re paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to attend what are effectively progressive madrasas, turning them into little more than brainwashed street fighters. Today, a gender studies graduate seems more likely to end up in jail for destruction of property than in a stable job. Perhaps that is part of the plan  —   striking fear into the patriarchy one load of prison laundry at a time. It can end, and it must end, or America will face eight years of violence on its streets, and who knows what state the country will be in after that? all because public universities refuse to honor their first amendment responsibilities. It starts with Berkeley. President Daddy, tear down their funding. DANGEROUS is available to   now via Amazon, in hardcover and Kindle editions.

Clinton Foundation’s Sweden Affiliate Bagged $6 Million from Undisclosed Donors - Breitbart,"A new Reuters report reveals that the Swedish fundraising arm of the embattled Clinton Foundation failed to disclose the identity of donors who funneled millions of dollars in donations to the charity, despite Hillary Clinton’s promise to do so. [The admitted failure in transparency came along with news Friday that the Bill, Hillary  Chelsea Clinton Foundation will shut down all of its fundraising affiliates in Sweden and the United Kingdom should Clinton win the White House in November.  “The foundation’s outpost in Stockholm has received nearly 270 million Swedish crowns, about $30 million, since it was established in 2011, while Clinton was still secretary of state,” Reuters reports. “Most of this money was given by the Swedish Postcode Lottery and the Dutch Postcode Lottery, according to the Clinton Foundation Insamlingsstiftelse’s website. ” However, some $6 million came from donors, the report continued, “that are not disclosed by the Clinton Foundation Insamlingsstiftelse. Cookstra said those donors were included in the donor list published on the main Clinton Foundation’s website but declined to identify them or say why they were donating in Sweden rather than the United States. ” Friday’s news comes amid new reporting on allegations that Hillary Clinton used her position as Secretary of State to sell access to major Clinton Foundation donors. Last month, Bill Clinton promised that he will resign from the Clinton Foundation board if Hillary Clinton wins the White House in November. The chronic reports of    at the Clinton’s troubled charity have taken a toll on the Democratic presidential nominee’s poll numbers. Now, a majority of Americans say Bill and Hillary Clinton failed to avoid conflicts of interest as millions of dollars flowed into their corrupt family foundation.
