Sanders said, in response to a question from a woman who told him that her parents were illegal immigrants, “I believe, absolutely, that we have to move aggressively toward comprehensive immigration reform. My dad was an immigrant. He came to this country at the age of 17. I know a little bit about the immigrant experience. Comprehensive immigration reform, and a path towards citizenship, now, my concern is that if Congress does not do what it should do, and pass that legislation, I will pick up where President Obama left office, and use the executive powers of the presidency to do everything that I can to make your parents safe in this country and not afraid. And the other thing that I will do, where I do disagree with President Obama, I will end the deportations that we’re seeing right now. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett'\n",
      " 'SZLIO v Administrative Appeals Tribunal [2008] FCA 124 (20 February 2008)http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2008/124.htmlapplication for reinstatementwhether original application \"dismissed in error\"findings of fact by tribunalno error in dismissal of application.adjournment sought to gather evidence to challenge tribunal\\'s findingsleave refused.migration lawpractice and procedure 1 This is an application brought under s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) (\"the AAT Act \") for review of a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (\"the Tribunal\") which refused an application for reinstatement under s 42A(10) of the AAT Act : see YBCF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] AATA 1863.The application for reinstatement was filed in respect of an application to the Tribunal (\"the review application\") for review of a decision of a delegate of the second respondent which refused the grant of a protection visa to the applicant.The Tribunal\\'s order dismissing the review application was made on 9 September 1996 pursuant to the filing of a notice of withdrawal by the applicant\\'s representative.Since that date, the applicant has been involved in other unsuccessful proceedings seeking a protection visa under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).2 Section 42A(10) of the AAT Act enables the Tribunal to reinstate an application to the Tribunal which has been \"dismissed in error\".Under s 42A(6) , unless there is an order of reinstatement of a dismissed application, that application is taken to be concluded.3 In relation to the present application for reinstatement, the Tribunal decided that the review application had not been dismissed in error because Mr Jones, the applicant\\'s representative before the Tribunal in 1996, had in fact acted within his instructions when lodging a withdrawal of the review application.4 When the matter came on for hearing, Mr Karp, counsel for the applicant, sought an adjournment on the basis that he had only recently been instructed and considered it necessary to seek further documentation, such as the transcript of the applicant\\'s proceedings before the Tribunal.This additional documentation would be sought to substantiate an argument that Mr Jones, by withdrawing the application before the Tribunal in 1996, had acted beyond his instructions, and that the applicant did not give \"informed consent\" to the withdrawal and consequent dismissal of the review application.This, it was said, would lead to a conclusion that the review application had been \"dismissed in error\" within the meaning of s 42A(10) of the AAT Act .5 On the basis of two considerations, I refused the adjournment sought by Mr Karp.The first consideration was that an application brought pursuant to s 44(1) of the AAT Act only permits an \"appeal\" from the Tribunal to this Court on a \"question of law\".The adjournment was sought by Mr Karp in order to gather evidence to challenge the correctness of factual findings made by the Tribunal, a matter which, in my view, would not assist the agitation of the proceedings before this Court.The second consideration was that this matter has had a long history of litigation, extending at least as far back as 1996, therefore making it desirous that the matter should progress as quickly as possible.6 The request for an adjournment having been denied, Mr Karp, with leave, amended the Notice of Appeal filed by the applicant so as to encompass the argument that the review application was withdrawn in 1996 without the applicant\\'s consent, and therefore was \"dismissed in error\" by the Tribunal.In substance, this argument seeks to challenge the clear factual findings made by the Tribunal at [12] of its reasons that there was no evidence that Mr Jones made a mistake in the execution of his client\\'s instructions by withdrawing the review application.The Tribunal concluded that the decision to withdraw the review application was within the scope of the applicant\\'s instructions to Mr Jones in 1996, and it also concluded at [11] that the applicant \"had placed himself in the hands\" of Mr Jones and was therefore \"unlikely to have taken a different view\" to that recommended by Mr Jones.7 Both the parties and the Tribunal discussed the decision of the Full Court in Goldie v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 367 ; (2002) 121 FCR 383.In that case, the Full Court addressed at 388 what might constitute an \"error\" for the purposes of an application for reinstatement under s 42A(10) of the AAT Act :  \\'The fault may have lain elsewhere, provided it induced the error.For example, because of a mistake as to his or her instructions, a solicitor or other representative of a party might have wrongly consented to a dismissal order or filed a notice of discontinuance.No fault would attach to the Tribunal; but, if the solicitor\\'s mistake induced the dismissal of the action, it could properly be said the application had been \"dismissed in error\".\\'   Having considered the material before it, the Full Court found that the word \"error\" is not limited to administrative errors on the part of the Tribunal.Rather, the term could include errors of any kind which related to the application before the Tribunal and which were operative in leading to the dismissal of that application.An example of such an error is a mistake by the applicant\\'s legal or other representative, such as misconstruing the applicant\\'s instructions, thereby inducing an erroneous dismissal of the application by the Tribunal.8 Counsel for the applicant submitted that, on its face, the Tribunal\\'s reasons disclose error.Mr Karp pointed to the observation at [11] in the reasons of the Tribunal that the applicant\\'s evidence suggested that he did not have any view as to whether the Tribunal proceedings should be commenced or concluded.Mr Karp submitted that the Tribunal, because it neither considered nor found that there was \"informed consent\" on the part of the applicant to the withdrawal of the review application, but rather simply observed that the applicant had given general instructions to Mr Jones to procure a particular outcome by whatever means he thought best, thus committed jurisdictional error.9 There are two difficulties with this submission.The first is that it is contrary to, and therefore seeks to challenge, the express finding by the Tribunal at [12] that there was no evidence that Mr Jones erred in the execution of the instructions given to him by the applicant.10 The second difficulty is that the Tribunal at [6] specifically considered the principle expressed in Goldie 121 FCR at 388 that a mistake by a representative of an applicant could, in certain circumstances, induce an \"error\" sufficient to ground an application for reinstatement.It is not to be lightly inferred that, having expressly referred to this principle, the Tribunal would ignore it when making a determination.The Tribunal also considered the statement of issues prepared by Mr Jones concerning the proposed withdrawal of the applicant\\'s review application, and the statement by the applicant that he was unaware of the decision to withdraw.Having done so, the Tribunal found at [12] that the evidence indicated that Mr Jones had not misunderstood or failed to execute the instructions given to him by the applicant.This conclusion is a finding of fact which was open to the Tribunal on the evidence before it, and which took into account the Full Court\\'s observations in Goldie 121 FCR at 388.Accordingly, there is no error of law shown in the reasoning of the Tribunal in relation to this issue.11 In addition to the submissions advanced by Mr Karp and discussed above, the original Notice of Appeal recites five grounds of appeal.None of these grounds are established in the present case.12 The first ground alleges that the Tribunal\\'s reasons disclose jurisdictional error and breach rules of natural justice.This ground of appeal must be rejected.Neither the assertion of jurisdictional error nor the assertion of a breach of natural justice are relevant to the decision under review, which concerns whether or not an application should be reinstated, and does not address the merits of any claim to refugee status.13 The second ground of appeal alleges that the Tribunal failed to consider specific material relevant to the application for reinstatement.This ground fails because the reasons of the Tribunal disclose that the material was referred to and considered.14 The third ground also alleges that the Tribunal failed to consider certain information.This ground must fail because it discloses no basis on which the Tribunal can be said to have ignored the information, or on which the information can be said to be of such importance that a failure to address it would constitute jurisdictional error.This ground may also be interpreted as alleging that the applicant did not consent to the withdrawal of the review application, and thus the Tribunal\\'s reasons fell into error.For the reasons given above, this submission cannot be accepted.15 The fourth ground is an alleged failure to make a proper assessment of the applicant\\'s case.As with the other grounds in the Notice of Appeal, no submissions were made on this point, and it is not established on the face of the Tribunal\\'s reasons.16 Finally, there is an allegation that evidence was not taken by the Tribunal from Mr Jones.In addition, this ground of appeal contains several other assertions which do not relate to the decision under review; rather, they concern such matters as errors in respect of a fear of persecution, an inability to understand the seriousness of the claim, and breaches of procedural fairness.There is no substance in any of these grounds.Specifically in relation to an alleged failure to call Mr Jones, there is no failure by the Tribunal because it was open to the applicant to arrange for him to be called pursuant to s 426 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).CONCLUSION  17 For the above reasons this appeal should be dismissed with costs.I certify that the preceding seventeen (17) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Tamberlin.Associate:Dated: 20 February 2008 Counsel for the Applicant: Mr L.

      " 'Breakfast. I\\'m going. I thought I\\'d say goodbye. Gentlemen, again, all the best. Take good care. Good luck and goodbye. It\\'s been fun. Here you go, sir. - Thank you. - You\\'re welcome. \"GUARDING TESS\\'\" I\\'m here to see the director of the Secret Service. Okay. Thanks. Is there anyplace where I could put my bags? Over there. - Thank you. - Okay. Congratulations, Doug. You\\'ve done a terrific job on a tough detail. Well, thank you, sir. It wasn\\'t that tough, actually. Summersville, Ohio, is not exactly the center of the universe... of course. But it\\'s a nice, quiet little place. Guarding Mrs. Carlisle gave me time to pick up many hours towards my Master\\'s. - Oh, great. - Of course, now I am hoping... for a little more active assignment, maybe back in the White House... or a criminal assignment out of New York or L.A. Sure. Let\\'s sit over here. Yes. Sir. Joan? - Yes? - Coffee. - Certainly. It\\'ll be just a moment. - Thanks. How is she? What\\'s she like? Well, there\\'s the public person who\\'s, you know, adored. Then there\\'s the private person who can, at times... be difficult to deal with if you don\\'t know how to handle the situation. - And you did. - Well, I guess, as well as anybody. I don\\'t envy my replacement, I\\'ll tell you that. I was in her husband\\'s White House, and I saw her in better times. She has her good days and her bad days now. I guess you could say... she\\'s several different personalities in one, like many people. Well, one of her personalities called the White House last night... and ask ed the president to arrange that you stay with her for another tour. The president? I can\\'t go back there. I can\\'t do three more years there. I can\\'t do three more minutes there. It\\'s... It... l... I mean, it\\'s... the worst assignment there is in the service. Well then, we\\'ve got a problem because the president... is asking you to return to Mrs. Carlisle as a personal favor to him. What if I say no? I\\'ll call him and tell him, uh, you said no. Take a moment to think it over. I\\'II check on the coffee. In New Jersey, ice kept three dolphins trapped in an inland waterway... In New Jersey, ice kept three dolphins trapped in an inland waterway... Wednesday, frustrating rescuers\\' efforts to free the animals... Where\\'s the Columbus paper? Who\\'s got it? Just checking my horoscope. Frederick, I told you 1,000 times, she can tell if we\\'ve read it before her. Sorry. - Morning, Doug. - Morning. - What are you doing here? - Long story. - Everything okay in Washington, Doug? - Yeah. Just back to pick up your accoutrement? Speak English. Back to pick up your shit? No smoking, Earl. Why not? She never comes down here. It\\'s a rule. - I am shock ed to see you back here. - Are ya? Ja. I thought you\\'d be guarding Jackie O. By now... standing outside the Russian Tea Room for hour after hour in the snow... with her inside, having little cakes and chatting to her fashionable friends. Here, Frederick. - I\\'II do it this morning, Fred. - Thank you. Good morning. Breakfast! Come in. Douglas, darling. Yes, ma\\'am? You seem to have dropped some of my things on the floor. Would you kindly pick them up for me? Yes, ma\\'am. That\\'s a good boy. Do I still have any influence in that evil town, or have they forgotten me? Ma\\'am, with all due respect, why me? Why, because I like you, Douglas. And my feelings are a bit hurt... that anyone would be that anxious to get away from me. Well, I certainly don\\'t mean to hurt your feelings, Mrs. Carlisle... but my assignment her e is finished, and I\\'d like to get back to Washington. Washington is a dead-end town, career-wise... unless you\\'re there purely to make money, which I\\'m sure you wouldn\\'t be. I\\'d like to go back. - Well, I\\'m sorry, but I need you her e. - Mrs. Carlisle? Yes? I\\'d just like you to know that I came back of my own free will. As an S.A. I. C... I could have refused this assignment. But I didn\\'t. S.A. I.C.? What is that? Ma\\'am, you know what that is. No, I really don\\'t. You do. Don\\'t tell me what I do and don\\'t know. That is not your place. What is a \"said\"? S.A. I.C. Stands for \"special agent in charge.\" Oh, I see. A special agent, are we? And in charge, no less. My, my, my. You rarely meet someone who\\'s a secret agent who\\'s also in charge. And why is he in charge? Well. Because he\\'s so doggone special. And you did not come back of your own free will. If you had a free will, you\\'d be miles from here. I have some very exciting news for you. I have an inoperable brain tumor. I have bought you and your men a SCU D missile launcher. We are going to the opera in Columbus. Which of those do you think is true? When? I would like to drive to Columbus a week from Friday. Yes, ma\\'am. May I say, it is good to see you getting out again? - Is it? - Yes, ma\\'am. Thank you, Douglas. That\\'s very patronizing of you. I suppose you couldn\\'t care less about opera. - No, ma\\'am, I couldn\\'t. - Of course not. You\\'re a typical, r ed-blooded American male. You\\'d probably rather watch the reruns of \"Mr. Ed\" on television, wouldn\\'t you? Tell me. If you had to choose between opera and \"Mr. Ed\"... I\\'d choose \"Mr. Ed\" in a second. Always so honest. I try. Good for you, Agent Dougie. Now put my rosebud on the tray and get out. As you can see, I\\'m extremely busy. Yes, ma\\'am. I expect him any minute. I\\'ll tell him as soon as he comes in. All right. Goodbye. - She wants to see you. - Oh, come on. I was just up there! She called the president to demand I pull another tour. How about that shit? - Why? - Because she likes me. - Oh, you don\\'t think that\\'s the reason? - I don\\'t know. Who knows with her? - She didn\\'t say she likes me, did she? - It has nothing to do with like. She doesn\\'t want a new guy comin\\' in here, shakin\\' things up... tryin \\' to get things running right. She\\'s got me broken in. She\\'ll never let me go. Now my master calls again. - Doug, come here. Check this out. - Helen Grace. Helen? Yes, Peter. In the city of Agua Dulce, automatic weapon fire broke out... shortly after 2:30 local time. The president was taken from the scene. Secret Service plainclothesmen... You see those Special Tactics guys? They\\'re everywhere. The crowd had only seconds ago applauded the American leader repeatedly. - The men with the guns and rifles. - Yes, Mrs. Carlisle? - Are they U.S. Secret Service agents? - Doug, she says it\\'s urgent. Tell her I\\'II be there in 15 minutes. He says he\\'ll be there in 15 minutes. Mrs. Carlisle? Go up. What does she want? Chocolate? Some kind of goddamn fruit drink? Do we look like a bunch of waiters? We wanna be down there! ...some sort of charity work. I have no idea... ...some sort of charity work. I have no idea... I got it! - I\\'m coming! - I can\\'t do three more years of this. I told you never to bring a gun in this room. Now get it out. Yes, ma\\'am. How dare you bring a gun in here? - Sorry, Mrs. Carlisle. - That\\'s all right. - That emergency alarm is to be used... - It belongs to me. I\\'ll use it anytime I want. I think it bothers the neighbors. Sorry. What is it? I want to play golf. What? Golf. It\\'s a game. My husband and I used to play it. - Do you remember that? - Mrs. Carlisle, it\\'s 38 degrees. Thank you, Tom. Could you have the car ready in half in hour? - Yes. Ma\\'am. - Thank you. Now go on. Shoo. Go on. Kimberly? Kimberly! Would you mind not standing there? No, not there. Go over there where I can see where you are. - Didn\\'t you guard Ford or Agnew? - No, ma\\'am. All they ever did was play golf, which was a blessing for the country. Yes, ma\\'am. No, I was too young. - What? - Too young to serve Ford or Agnew. Get back in the cart. Get in the cart! Yes, ma\\'am. What is this all about? She sits up in her room for five years, and now we\\'ve got golf. And opera. - What\\'s next? - Synchronized swimming. Why are you making noise? We\\'re trying to putt. Sorry. Why don \\'t you make yourselves useful? One of you, come and hold the pin. Yes, ma\\'am. Putt! Would you be kind enough to get my first ball, please, Doug? I\\'m a Secret Service agent, Mrs. Carlisle, not a caddy. You want that ball? I suggest you go get it yourself. - Ralph? - Yo! Since you\\'ve insisted on me staying... you should know I intend to do my job by the book... which means we don\\'t run errands, we don\\'t make snacks... and we don\\'t check our guns at the door. Now, if you don\\'t like any of this... I suggest you call Washington and get yourself a new man. I\\'d be very careful if I were you, Agent. You \\'re way out of your depth. Let\\'s switch. - I\\'ve got to go up to the clubhouse. - Sure thing, Doug. I told her... I told her... \"No more calling us \\'gofers with guns,\\' snacks in the middle of the night... no more checking our weapons outside your bedroom door.\" You said that? In so many words, I said, from now on, we go by the book. - And she stood for this? - She didn\\'t say a thing. Oh, yeah. She tells me to go find her ball. I said, \"I\\'m not a caddy. I\\'m a Secret Service agent. - You want that ball, find it yourself.\" - Come on. - Are you crazy? - No. Here\\'s why... Doug, telephone. - Hello? - Mr. Chesnic? - Yes. - Please hold for the president. - Hello? - Uh, hello! - That you, Doug? - Yes, sir. - How are ya? - I\\'m fine. And you? Well, I got this call from Tess Carlisle. And I know this sounds a little crazy... but did you tear up some flowers of hers? - Doug? You there? - Yes, sir. - Somethin \\' about a bunch of roses. - Well, uh, no. - It wasn\\'t a bunch. Sir. - Uh-huh. - Well, how many of them were there? - Just one, sir. I see. And you tore it up, did ya? - No, sir. I didn\\'t tear it up. - Well, what \\'d you do? - I merely removed the bud. - From her flower? Yes. Sir. Okay. Well, let\\'s get past that for a second. - I was her husband\\'s vice president. - Yes, sir. Frankly, I owe a lot to the Carlisle�s. She seconded my nomination. - You know that too. - Yes, sir. Why don \\'t we try to get along better in Ohio? What do you say? - Yes, sir. Absolutely. - I don \\'t get it. One day she calls me, says she can \\'t live without you. Next day, she�s callin \\', almost in tears. So maybe you two have some kind of sicko thing goin \\' on... - No! No, sir. I can tell you... - I\\'ll tell you this, Doug. Any more phone calls from her, you \\'re gonna be guardin\\' my dog. Understand? - Yes, sir. - \\'Cause I probably got... the most important job in the world, and I feel like a goddamn idiot... havin\\' to call you about a goddamn flower I - You know what I mean? - I certainly do. Are you gonna help me out on this one? - You can count on it, sir. - Thanks. That \\'s what I wanted to hear. - Have a nice evening, son. - Yes, sir. \\'Night. If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator. Hey, Mrs. Carlisle, I got your laundry and a Whopper. Who\\'s this opera by again? Mozart. Oh, that\\'s right. I saw a movie about him. The guy was a complete jerk. The end of the movie, some guy comes to see him in a party mask. It was just a mask, right? But it upsets Mozart so much... that he drops over dead, just like that. - What the hell kinda guy is that? - I don\\'t know, Lee. Here. Don\\'t shoot yourself. Very funny. Happy huntin\\'. Well? Sorry, ma\\'am. This way, ma\\'am. Kill the engine. Start the engine. - Earl. - Yes. Ma\\'am? - Do you like your job? - Yes, ma\\'am. A lot. Ma\\'am, the protectee is never allowed to sit directly behind the driver. That\\'s a regulation. Nobody does it. Not the president, not anybody. The sun will be on that side, and I do not want the sun. Perhaps you could sit on the proper side but slightly then to the middle. - Nope. - Ma\\'am, excuse me... but we are not leaving this house until you are seated properly... with your seat belt firmly fastened. Jesus Christ. Let her sit on the hood if she wants to. Move it out, Earl. We\\'re rolling. Oh, these family outings are always so stressful. Look. I have never been so embarrassed in my life. I want to go home. I don\\'t want to go to the hotel, and I will never return to Columbus again. Yes, ma\\'am. For what it\\'s worth, I was just trying to help. Your help is most precisely what I do not want. When will you people get that? Hello. Oh. - Please, no autographs now. - It\\'s good to see you. - Thank you. - Thank you. Mrs. Carlisle. - You got my vote! - I appreciate that. Thank you so much. Thanks for coming, Tess. What is this? I just wanted her autograph. I\\'ll do you one better. Write me, and I\\'ll get you an autographed picture. - Good night, ma\\'am. - Oh, a picture. How wonderful. Well, thank you so very much. Very nice and wonderful. I hope you enjoyed the opera as much as I did. Thank you. I\\'ve changed my mind. We\\'ll be staying in Columbus tonight. - Yes, ma\\'am. - Give \\'em hell, Tess. What do you care where she sits? She\\'s supposed to be where the driver and I can both see her at the same time. I know that. That\\'s not what I\\'m asking. This detail\\'s a cupcake. It may be the most boring detail in the service, but it\\'s still a cupcake. Why are you gonna risk your career on crap like that? Because it\\'s not crap. It\\'s my job. I\\'m either gonna do it right, take pride in it, or find something else to do. You\\'re right. I can\\'t argue. But Doug, I wouldn\\'t piss her off. - More calls to the White House, and... - I\\'ll be guarding the president\\'s dog. Bullshit. You\\'ll be gone. You try to get a job out there now. Know what they want in private security? Guys that can bench-press 9,000 pounds. This is a good deal. You\\'ve let it get personal. It\\'s not personal. Of course it is. She doesn\\'t even know the rest of us are alive. - How is she? - She\\'s fine. But, uh... - Get rid of those. - Okay. What about, uh, Ali-Tyson? Ali, TKO, eighth round, in his prime. All right. What about Mrs. Carlisle and Nancy Reagan? - In their prime? - Yeah. Mrs. Carlisle would knock Nancy out in the sixth to seventh round. - It wouldn\\'t go the distance? - No. Two completely different fighters. Nancy doesn\\'t have the big-time punch. She throws these cutting left jabs and combinations. Always in your face. Unrelenting. Bap, bap, bap! Mrs. Carlisle, she\\'s a floater, a dancer. Totally unpredictable. Just when you think you got her where you want her, bam! Out of nowhere comes her right h and, and Nancy\\'s on Queer Street. End of fight. - I think you\\'re right about that. - I know I\\'m right. I know. That\\'s why I ask ed you. Ralph, be a dear and get me a Baby Ruth, would you, please? - Yes. - Thanks. Earl, go. I can\\'t. Who got you this job? Did they, or did I? Yes! Doug, she took off! Earl! I want you to pull over right now. You hear me, goddamn it? - I\\'m sorry, Dou g. - It\\'s not your fault. It\\'s mine. Should\\'ve seen it coming. Uh-huh. Hold on a minute. I\\'m gonna... Agent Chesnic, I\\'m gonna put you on the speaker. Is there someone else in the room? No. I just want to practice my putting while we\\'re talking. What can I do? Would you please put out an all-points for Mrs. Carlisle�s automobile? It\\'s a \"92 Lincoln, Ohio plates... Kilo-Hotel-Oscar 362. When last seen, it was heading east on the Chester Exit of l-71. Just hold everything. Have I got this right? Have you Secret Service boys gone and lost the president\\'s wife again? I don\\'t believe there\\'s any cause for concern here. She\\'s with her driver. She\\'s perfectly safe, but proper procedure requires us... to notify you. Of course it does. - Uh, we\\'ll get on this right now. - Thank you. Agent Chesnic, uh... Ms. Carlisle is pretty slippery, isn\\'t she? I mean, for a senior citizen. Hello? Doug, let\\'s have a little stroll around the yard... before we go in there and talk to him, okay? I want you to go in there and tell Earl to meet me in the office. Okay, Lee? - All right. - Thank you. Hey, everybody\\'s mad at me, right? Hey, everybody\\'s mad at me, right? What am I supposed to do? I\\'m just a driver, you know? Hey! - You\\'re through! You know that? - No, I don\\'t. - You don\\'t know that? - No, I don\\'t. - Why don\\'t you know that, you tick? - Buddy, come on. Because she assured me that I was not gonna be fired. In fact, I would have been fired if I hadn\\'t done it. Look, look. You guys come and go, but I live here... and I keep my job because of her. Oh, you think I don\\'t try to talk her out of these crazy things. But I got no choice. Well, you\\'re fired, Earl. Trust me. Come in. - Did you en joy yourself today? - Don \\'t take that tone with me, Douglas. Look, this is just stupid, okay? Which part? The part where I have to run away like a fugitive to get one hour of privacy... or the part where I am spoken to like a child? I fir ed Earl. This has happened twice now. He is a driver in the employ of the Secret Service. I can\\'t do anything about the cook or the nurse. They work for you. He works for us. He\\'s gone! He works for you because I told you to hire him. He\\'s my chauffeur, and he\\'s staying! You\\'ve got to let me leave this detail, ma\\'am. I can\\'t do my job effectively. Whatever you like. You can go anytime you please. Thank you. You\\'re welcome. Goodbye, Mrs. Carlisle. Goodbye. If I promise never to run away again... will that do? Ma\\'am, I am truly sorry, but l... For God\\'s sake, Doug, I only went for a little drive. - It was crazy. - Yes. Crazy. Exactly. You should try it sometime, Douglas. You should try going crazy yourself. You should get a date... have a martini, drive with the top down. You should, better yet, give a tired old widow a break. I am very sorry, Mrs. Carlisle, but the regulations... Oh, well, fine. Go. Whatever you want to do. Just leave. One less gunman lounging around my house. Take the whole bunch with you. We are not gunmen, Mrs. Carlisle. Since I am leaving for sure this time, I\\'d like to take this opportunity... to remind you that you can refuse Secret Service protection... anytime you want. I believe you already know that. Well, that\\'s brilliant, Doug. Do you think they\\'d really let me get away with that? I don\\'t know why not. Other people have done it. But I think you like it. I think you like having seven men... and no women agents... I notice... at your beck and call, day and night. - \"Get a date.\" - How dare you? - Goodbye, Mrs. Carlisle. - Get out! Get out of my house this instant. And stay out! Yeah? This is Air Force One calling. Stand by for the president. - Doug? - Sir? - How are you? - I\\'m fine. How are you? Not too good. I\\'m on my way to London. I should be workin\\' on a speech. Instead, I\\'m havin \\' a goddamn Tess Carlisle problem I - What the hell \\'s that about, Doug? - L... It\\'s... Do you know that, as of this morning, she \\'s refused Secret Service protection? - Where the hell�s she get that idea? - L... This woman is a national treasure. You and I know what a pain she is. But we don\\'t count. It\\'s what the damn voters think. That\\'s what counts. And they want this woman looked after. You understand me? Yes. Sir. What if some lunatic cuts her throat? What about that? - I agree, sir... - How much doo-doo would I catch... if something like that happened on my watch? - Yes, sir. - Let me make it real clear. Get over to her house and straighten this out. I\\'m countin \\' on you, and so \\'s the country. - Yes, sir. I\\'ll get on it right away. - That\\'s what I wanted to hear. Thanks. The next time you\\'re in town, have dinner with us at the White House. Yes. Sir. I\\'d be honored. I\\'II be there. Thank you. - All right. Have a nice day, pal. - Yes. Sir. I will. Bye-bye. She told us to leave and take the flag with us. I loaded weapons in the car. Jimmy. - Hello. That you, Doug? - Yeah. I want you to open the gate. No way. Come on. Let me in. I\\'m actin\\' on the authority of the president of the United States. So what, Doug? WE got Mrs. Carlisle in here. Doug, this is Frederick. I want you to listen very closely. Jimmy and I are holding Mrs. Carlisle hostage. Here is what we want. We want $100 in unmarked bills... and a helicopter, matching sports coats... and a videocassette of the movie \"Gigi.\" Are you listening to me? - Hello, Earl. Do me a favor. - Can you hear me? - Can you talk to Mrs. Carlisle? - You owe me an apology. Yeah, probably. Can you talk to her? - She hasn\\'t seen anyone. - Get her to let me in. If she wants to go out, let me know. I\\'ll be in the car. - Okay. - Than k you. Okay, Barbara. I guess you might as well go home. Guys, go home. Get some sleep. All right. The three of us will take perimeter positions. Lee, take Maple. Ralph, go around back. We\\'ll take our cars. I\\'ll sit out front. - Let\\'s load this stuff up. - This is nuts. You got a better idea? - The gate\\'s opening. You read me? - I gotcha, Doug. Copy that. Okay, guys. We\\'re rolling. She\\'s in the Town Car heading west. Earl, pull over. What are you doing? Let\\'s talk. I took your advice. I did what you wanted. Now leave me alone. Drive, Earl. - Stay with the car. - Yes, ma\\'am. Mrs. Carlisle, I was just on the phone to the president. - Really? - Yes, ma\\'am. He said you should let... Get away from me. Yes, ma\\'am. Yes? Barry. Doug, this is Ralph. I\\'m goin \\' off duty right now. She hasn\\'t been out all day. By the way, Frederick said Mrs. Carlisle�s son is flying in tomorrow. That \\'s about it from here. Later. Barry! Oh, hello, my darling! Hi, Mom. You look so wonderful. - I missed you. - Bring in his luggage. - It\\'s okay. He\\'ll get it. - Come. Tell me all about your life. This thing is the best project that I\\'ve seen in years, of its nature. Here. What we\\'re talking about... is 125 detached and semi-detached retirement villas... starting from a $125,000 Venice studio layout... going all the way up to the Tuscany four-bedroom plan, starting at $799,000. And at least half of the villas have a view... of the nine-hole golf course designed by Taylor Frye. The whole project\\'s primo, Mom. It\\'s first-class the whole way. The only problem... And I don\\'t think of it as a problem. I think of it more like an opportunity. You know what I mean? Some of the management at Top Line Properties got burned... in the S& L mess a couple years ago. So what we\\'re looking to do now is show people that we are rock solid. One of the ways of doin g that is getting people of your stature... to endorse the project. All we would need would be a letter. Something for the brochure, saying you think the project\\'s... a good one for older people looking for a sun-and-recreation-type lifestyle. Only downside is, the bank\\'s being tightfisted in Phoenix... \\'cause they made those stupid loans. We\\'ve got to show people that they can trust... the Hacienda Palms concept down the line. What? I said, \"No.\" Shit! Joy to the world The Lord is come Joy to the world The Lord is come Let Earth receive her King Let Every heart Prepare Him room And heaven and nature sing This is the kind of mandate President Carlisle wanted from this convention. This is, for all intents and purposes, a coronation rather than a nomination. Jim Carlisle is going to get everything he wants from the delegates. They seem ready to follow him into the... Their stay at their home in Summersville. The two met at nearby Denison College and fell in love as undergraduates. Interestingly enough, Tess Carlisle was the class president... and Jim Carlisle was the lazy, lacrosse- playing student with a C average. Later, in the Rose Garden, the president put aside his congressional woes... by welcoming these Girl Scouts to the White House. They... Special news bulletin. The president suffered a massive heart attack... WE are now looking at the Joint Chiefs of Staff... and, of course, in the front row, there is the president�s daughter, Theresa. And her husband. They have two children and live in New York City. On the other side of Mrs. Carlisle, the president�s son, Barry... now a very successful businessman in the state of Arizona. A very sad, sad day. Oh. God! Oh, ow! You scared me to death! You sneak ed up on me. I did no such thing. - Yes, you did. - I did not. Where\\'d you come from? I came from that gate, and I intend to go back the same way. Mrs. Carlisle? Wait, please. Look, I was wrong. - About a lot of things. - Yes, ma\\'am. But I was really wrong about you refusing protection. That\\'s the one thing you were right about. You suppose the average taxpayer has any idea how much money is being spent... to guard all these old political has-beens and their wives? - I don\\'t know. - My God, it\\'s an outrage. - Yes. - The cars and the manpower. - It makes me sick. - Listen... Just like e Washington to spend money like that. - Can we please talk for one second? - Just like Washington. - About what? - The detail coming back in. You came out here to ask me something. What was that about? Well, I was wondering if you\\'d like to have a cup of coffee. Oh. Coffee keeps me awake, Doug. Even decaf. I\\'d like to have a drink. I take a drink occasionally. Not often. Did you know that? No, ma\\'am. Well, I do. If I located a bottle, would you join me in a highball? Yes, ma\\'am. Ah, you\\'re such a wild and crazy thing. Well, my daughter and I barely speak. Unfortunately, I don\\'t have a much-improved relationship with my son. I don\\'t blame them. The children got screwed. We got the Governor\\'s Mansion and the Senate... the White House. They got this very peculiar childhood. I say, we... Jim and I were truly partners. You must have known, in the White House, how much he depended on me. Didn\\'t you? Yes, ma\\'am. That was pretty common knowledge. You must have known about my husband\\'s occasional indiscretions. Didn\\'t think I knew about it, did you? Well, did you? Nobody thought I knew about it, did they? Well, let\\'s just keep that our little secret. Yes, ma\\'am. You can count on me. I know that. Douglas, we\\'re getting out of here. I�ve talked about myself enough for one night. Let\\'s talk about you. - Me? - Mm-hmm. Oh, well, there\\'s nothing much to say, ma\\'am. Come on, Douglas. Of course there is. For in stance, what\\'s it like guar ding that crazy old bitch, Tess Carlisle? - Mrs. Carlisle, please. - It must get pretty screwy. She lives like a hermit and plays golf in the snow. I. Um... Just the rudimentary facts. Family. Start there. Family? My father is a retired cop. My mother was a millinery buyer for a small department store. Married once, for seven months. - Come on, Douglas. - You look ed into my records. My husband told me. I do not look into people\\'s records. Well, was it painful or a fling? Everybody seemed to know what she was like except me. I\\'m sorry. I don\\'t like people knowing about it because it\\'s embarrassing to me... that I was married for such a short time. You can count on me, Secret Agent Douglas Chesnic. Special Secret Agent in Charge Douglas Chesnic. Well, congratulations, Special Agent Douglas. Well, congratulations, Special Agent Douglas. You\\'ve been a naughty boy, but now all is forgiven. How\\'d you talk your way back in here? Well, Earl, the simple answer is, she likes me. - Jimmy, ham and eggs, I think. - Yes, ma\\'am. Good morning, gentlemen. Good morning, Mrs. Carlisle. The president is coming to Summersville. We must prepare for that. Will you have the cars and the machine gun s ready in about an hour? Yes, ma\\'am. Good. Thank you. Frederick, perhaps some sit-ups. Well, I think it\\'s a real feather in our cap... to have the president coming to the dedication of the final wing. - Do you? - Yes, ma\\'am. It\\'s a tempest in a teapot. But if the president insists on coming, what can I do... but try to be gracious until the whole affair is over with? Where do you plan to stage this thing, Mr. Porter? I thought outside, at your husband\\'s sepulchre... we\\'d put up a tent. It\\'s of no great concern, and I\\'m delighted to leave these matters to you. But if it were me, I\\'d have the presentation in the reading room... before my husband\\'s portrait. I\\'d serve refreshments in the library with a bar in the adjoining parlor. What do you think of that, Mr. Porter? Well. I think that would be nice too. Thank you so much again. I suppose you\\'re all excited about the president... visiting us poor little country mice. Yes, ma\\'am. I see this as a chance to get my people on their toes again. - Thinking sharp. - So you think they\\'re dull too? Frederick, tell me, which of these exemplifies... elegant disdain yet sincere concern? That one. You\\'re good. You know that? You are very good. I talk ed to them this morning. We\\'ll have six of their guys inside. Ten on the grounds. But we\\'re in charge of the physical plant. Okay? - Yeah. - Okay. Those guys are taking their orders from us. Does she want to be known today? Don\\'t know her. - It\\'s got no price at all. - Yes, ma\\'am. This is Bobby in canned goods. Are you near the manager? I need a price check on Lesieur baby peas. Repeat. Lesieur baby peas. Lesieur baby peas? They\\'re on special today. Two for 59cents. They\\'re on special today. Two for 59cents. Uh, copy that. It\\'s two for 59cents. - I only want one. - Roger that. She only wants one. - How much for just one? - The same. It\\'s a two-for-one thing. Bobby, it\\'s a two-for-one thing, so I suggest you go ahead and get both. Copy that. I believe we\\'ve lost interest in peas. Repeat. Lost interest in peas. Canned goods out. - Someone\\'s smoking in here. - Ma\\'am? Someone is smoking in a grocery store. - Are you going to deal with this? - Uh, yes, ma\\'am. Okay. I want one of those temporary rinses. Not blue hair. - Yes, ma\\'am. - If it\\'s blue, I\\'ll chop it all off. - Yes, ma\\'am. - Okay. Let\\'s do it. I suppose you\\'d better give it to her. You \\'re her secretary. Oh, I love this color. Come in. It\\'s just great. Douglas, hello. Come on, we\\'re back here. - Mrs. Carlisle? - Yes, come in. - What do you think of this? - I think you look beautiful. Thank you. I\\'ve got a fax here from Washington. It\\'s confidential. Would you excuse us for just a moment? The president\\'s not coming. Pressing matters of state. Well. We can relax then. Yes, ma\\'am. Will they be sending someone in his place? Secretary of Commerce, Yvonne Boyer. Excellent. That\\'ll make your job a lot easier. Yes, ma\\'am. Would you be kind enough to send the hairdresser back to collect her things? Yes, ma\\'am. The thing that my husband would be particularly proud of... is that this center is a place of learning and contemplation. He would have liked that very, very much. What I am especially proud of... is that we took a fine, wonderful old building... and we made it useful again. That appeals to me... perhaps because I\\'m getting old myself. In closing, I would like to thank Yvonne Kiki Hernandez-Boyer... for taking time out of her hectic schedule to be here with us today. Thank you so much, Kiki, for coming. You honor us all with your gracious, gracious company. Good morning. Yeah. Come in. Yes, ma\\'am? I\\'d like to go on a picnic tomorrow down by the lake. Yes, ma\\'am. They say it might snow tomorrow. Well, we can\\'t just wait on summer, can we? I guess not. I\\'d very much appreciate it if I could go with just you and not everyone else. Yes, ma\\'am. Thank you. Is this better than \"Mr. Ed\"? Mrs. Carlisle, I think it\\'s getting colder. Would you leave me alone, please? Yes, ma\\'am. Mrs. Carlisle? Ma�am? I\\'ll get the chair. Stop! Hey, Earl, stop! Damn! - Office. - Are they back yet? - Doug? - Yeah. Are they there? Who? Mrs. Carlisle? - Yes. - They\\'re not here. Aren \\'t they with you? Call everybody in. Come get me. - Did they get back yet? - Nope. - When did they take off? - Two-and-a-half hours ago. Jesus. Who\\'s this? Tom, they there? Call Sheriff Janson and the highway patrol. Tell them they\\'re out joyriding. It\\'s not a problem, but inform them that there\\'s no security with Mrs. Carlisle. - Thanks. - Washington? No, not yet. We\\'ll give them another hour. Goddamn her for this. Okay, Barbara. Let\\'s call Washington. This is the worst moment of my life. If she was taken, the people who did it must have been setting it up for months. - Yes, sir. - Did you notice anything suspicious? No, sir. Nothing at all? No, sir. I have to call the president when we get to the Carlisle place. Yes. Sir. It\\'ll be almost midnight by then, Mr. Harrison. That\\'s no problem. He\\'s up. - Thanks for coming in. - Sure. Excuse me. I would appreciate it if you\\'d put something under there... so that we don\\'t scratch the table. Doug, why don\\'t you come in here with me. Doug, this is Charles Ivy, CIA. Doug here is agent in charge for Mrs. Carlisle. Mr. President, I\\'ve got Agent Doug Chesnic with me. Does he want to speak with me? She has a full-time nurse. What\\'s that for? She\\'s had some dizziness the last couple of years... and he monitors her medication... makes sure she\\'s eating right, that kind of stuff. Seven well-trained, heavily-armed men... can\\'t take care of one little old lady. You disgust me. Yes. Sir. Doug, Sheriff Janson\\'s on the phone. Who\\'s that? - Local sheriff. - What\\'s he got? It\\'s for Agent Chesnic. Doug, why don\\'t you take it in the kitchen. They found the car on a country road. Driver unconscious on the front seat. He\\'s being taken to a county hospital. Mrs. Carlisle was not at the scene. Jesus Christ. Mr. President... Tess Carlisle has been kidnapped. I thought you\\'d appreciate an update. A plastic syringe was found on the floor of the front seat. The lab says it contains a combination of extremely powerful drugs. Ketamine and Ativan. Both are common. Easy to steal... and used together would knock out a full-grown man... within ten seconds of being injected. A big enough shot would keep him down for up to six... seven hours. Which squares... with how long your guy was out. We take it as a good sign that they used the drug... instead of killing him. The injuries... on the back of the driver\\'s neck are burns, which is interesting. They\\'re both in the shape of a small crescent, smaller than a quarter. My friends from the CIA think it might be a brand... a signature kind of thing for a Middle Eastern terrorist organization. Also, we spoke to Mrs. Carlisle\\'s doctor. Those pills... that she takes for dizziness... Actually it\\'s a little more serious than that. She has an inoperable brain tumor. Did any of you know that? We\\'ll have fiber and fingerprint reports by late afternoon. And a note was found in the car\\'s glove compartment... demanding $15 million. That\\'s about it, except we\\'re gonna need these offices. You can all go home if you want to. That\\'s the best thing to do, I think. Thanks. Well. Let\\'s... get any personal stuff and get out. What\\'s with that nonsense about Middle Eastern terrorists? Can you imagine a bunch of Arabs slipping around Summersville unnoticed? What about this plastic syringe in the car? Does that bother anybody else? If these guys are such pros, why would they leave that behind? It had to be left there on purpose. How long has she been gone? Twenty-two hours and 30 minutes. - Doug, can I get a ride with you? - Yes. Mrs. Carlisle... hired me. I know, Kimberly. We\\'ll find her. When others wouldn\\'t. Make this quick. I\\'m busy. I want you to think about this. Mrs. Carlisle\\'s sitting in the back of the Lincoln, right? If she\\'s been taken against her will, she know she won\\'t just take that. She\\'s gonna take some form of action. What does she have in the back seat as a weapon? - I don\\'t know. - Cigarette lighter, right in the door. Makes a crescent-shaped burn. You getting anywhere? We\\'ll know more when all the lab stuff comes in. If there\\'s anything I can do, Mr. Shaeffer... or Doug, just ask me. Thank you. Can we have a look at your neck? Yeah, I guess. What for? It\\'s just such a peculiar thing. Let me get a nurse to help with the bandage. What\\'s this about? He just wants to see the burns. He thinks they\\'re the key to this case. - The burns? - Yeah. I told them, I don\\'t know how they got there because I was unconscious. - Could you sit up, please? - Okay. - What do you think? - About the burns? - We got a couple of ideas. - Like what? Just ideas. I certainly hope you\\'re not gonna try to pin this on me. I wasn\\'t the one who arranged... for Mrs. Carlisle to be out in the middle of nowhere... and guarded by only one agent. And I also wasn\\'t the one who... hated Mrs. Carlisle with a vengeance. That was Agent Chesnic here. Did he tell you that? - You hated her? - With a vengeance. - I actually like her very much. - They argued all the time. Isn\\'t that right? Is that normal for an agent to be arguing with is... No. Of course it\\'s not. You should be asking him the questions. He hated her guts. Look, look. She treated these guys like dirt. You know what I mean? She threw them all out of the house a few weeks ago. Can I have a cigarette? Sorry, don\\'t smoke. Why are you suddenly so upset? I\\'m not upset. Well, wouldn\\'t you be? Look, I may be only the driver... but I\\'m at least smart enough to know... that you guys are not gonna leave town without putting somebody in jail... and that somebody doesn\\'t have to be guilty. I know how you guys operate. You did it. Didn\\'t you, Earl? The hell with you, okay, Dougie? It was easy, wasn\\'t it? Will you get him out of my face? I\\'m not putting up with this. - All right. - Okay. But I\\'m gonna have to warn you that the FBI now considers you a suspect. - That\\'s just terrific. - I suggest you get a lawyer soon. Don\\'t you worry. I\\'m gonna protect myself. Where is she? Where is she? Speak to my lawyer, Agent Dougie. All right, that\\'s it for now. No more questions, but we\\'re going to have to have you available to us. At our convenience. All right? Oh, no, Doug. Let\\'s not be stupid here, all right? - Where is she? - I don\\'t know. Doug, we\\'re the good guys, okay? We don\\'t do stuff like this. Don\\'t you get it? I\\'m the only witness, and he wants to kill me. - Doesn\\'t that tell you anything? - Come on, Doug. - I\\'m telling you to holster your pistol. - Jesus help me. Goddamn it, Doug, put that gun away. You\\'re already in so much trouble! - He\\'s gonna tell me. - I don\\'t know anything. We can\\'t use it. Not like this! I\\'m going to count to five... then I\\'ll shoot off your toe. Oh. God! And then I\\'m gonna count to five and shoot another toe. I don\\'t know anything! Will you get that through your... Are you crazy? Are you? - He didn\\'t count! - Five. Four... You\\'re going to prison. Will you just listen to me? If he is involved... - Nurse. Should we call the police? - Yes, and the FBI! If he is involved, then she knows it. And if she knows it, her life is worthless. They have to fucking kill her! We don\\'t have time to meet his lawyer! - God help me! - Five. Four... three, two... Okay! Okay! They\\'ve got her in an abandoned farmhouse. - An abandoned farmhouse? - Yeah. I don\\'t think so. Five... I swear to God. I swear to God. Doug, really, listen. It\\'s my sister and her husband. Check it out. It wasn\\'t my idea! I swear to God! They made me do it! Mrs. Carlisle\\'s all right, Doug... because my sister is taking very good care of her. Freeze! You have the right to remain silent. - She\\'s over here. - Where? There. She\\'s down there. What? Take that off. You buried her? Jesus Christ. She alive? Yeah. Pretty sure. You put her down there, what? Over 30 hours ago? This is not a young woman. Better start praying. What did you do? What did you do? Take it easy! Get him out of her e! Look how deep this is. They weren\\'t gonna dig this woman up. Keep her alive for a day or two, in case you had to have her... just cut the ventilation and walk. - Who let you back in? - We want to dig. We\\'re responsible. You\\'re upset. Wait outside. Let the experts do it. Okay, dig. Get out of there. - Give these men the shovels. - Thank you. Give me the shovel. - I think I found something! - Pull up the pipe. Is she down there? Mrs. Carlisle? Ma\\'am? Somebody get a power saw. Come on, move! I want soap, water and blankets. Nobody sees her like this. Sir, that\\'s too many. - We\\'re getting on. - No can do, pal. All right. We\\'ll meet them at the hospital. - What do you think? - She\\'s alive. That\\'s all I know. Come on, guys. Snap it up! Hey! Anybody out here named Douglas Chesnic? Doug Chesnic! I\\'m Chesnic. What is it? Lady\\'s awake, sir. Says she\\'s not going without her Secret Service detail. - Is that you guys? - That\\'s us. Can you come aboard? Yeah. We can do that. Wait one second, sir. I\\'m sorry, gentlemen. I have to throw some of you off. - She gonna be all right? - Looks like it. Where have you been? Looking for you. How long did it take you to figure out the cigarette lighter burns? About 22 hours. Oh, Douglas, it was so obvious. No it wasn\\'t. Nobody got it but me. I can hardly believe that. - It\\'s true. - Howard Shaeffer, FBI. If I may say, ma\\'am, Agent Chesnic is the reason we found you. - If he hadn\\'t shot a man... - Shot a man? Yes, ma\\'am. You finally got to shoot somebody, huh, Douglas? - Did you kill him? - Shot him in the toe. Oh, after all that practice. - Yes. Ma\\'am. - If I could set the record straight... I\\'d just like to talk to this gentleman, if you don\\'t mind. I\\'ll get it, dear. Tell the others I\\'ll be out in a minute. - Hello? - The president�s returning your call. - Yes, thank you. - Yes, ma \\'am. Are they treating you all right in that hospital? If they�re not... Harold, I want this Secret Service agent of mine taken care of. Tess, the man discharged a firearm in a public place. I don\\'t care about any of that. This young man saved my life. He\\'s like a son to me, Harold. I want him taken care of, understand? Sure, Tess. I\\'m sure we... And if anything should ever happen to me... I want your personal word that you will look after him. - Sure, Tess... - Good. That\\'s all I wanted to know. Have yourself a nice day. Yes, ma \\'am. What is this? It\\'s your wheelchair, ma\\'am. I can see it\\'s a wheelchair, but I won\\'t be needing it, thank you. It\\'s hospital policy that you leave by wheelchair. But I would really prefer not to sit in the wheelchair. I would much rather walk on my own feet, with my own steam, out of the hospital. But the rules and regulations state that each patient... Oh. The rules. Rules and regulations, young man, are not something I\\'m fond of. So if you would just allow me... I\\'m just trying to do my job. I am not going to sit in that! If I may interrupt. The regulations aren\\'t really that sacred, are they? And Tess... get in the goddamn chair. 5@y3'\n",
      " ' (CNN) A few weeks ago, a Denver teacher did something that really got our attention. Kyle Schwartz handed out   notes and asked her third graders to complete the sentence, ”I wish my teacher knew . .. ” She does the exercise every year to learn more about her students, but this year, she posted a few of the children’s replies to Twitter with the hashtag #IWishMyTeacherKnew. Some of the responses were so heartbreaking in their honesty, such as one child who wrote that she wanted her teacher to know she didn’t have anyone to play with, and another who wanted her teacher to know that she misses her dad so much because he was deported to Mexico. No surprise, the effort became a viral sensation, with teachers and students around the country using the hashtag to weigh in. #IWishMyTeacherKnew shares students’ heartbreak, hopes, So, as we looked ahead to Mother’s Day, we thought, ”What if we ask kids to finish the sentence: I wish my mother knew . .. ?”  and recorded their responses. What do they wish their mom knew about how they feel about her? We invited a group of mainly second graders from my daughters’ public school to a glorious community garden in Manhattan, the West Side Community Garden, which has over 12, 000 tulips on display. You couldn’t ask for a better backdrop for our chance to probe these young minds when it comes to their mothers, and the children didn’t disappoint. ”I hope my mother knows that I love her more than she loves me,” said Riya.  When I asked what her mother might think when she hears that, she replied, ”She’s going to think it’s the opposite way . .. that she loves me more than I love her.” Related: 12 ways moms are nailing it every day  Said Sophia, ”I wish my mother knew that I love her so much that I cannot explain how much I love her.” Phoebe said that she wishes her mom knew that one of her favorite things is when something funny happens and they stare at each other, and crack up, which makes everything even funnier. ”It feels like you’re not alone. Somebody else feels the same way,” she said. Taizo said he wished his mom knew that he loves her even when he gets mad at her. ”I wish she knew that. She does great things,” he said. Some of the kids used the opportunity to send a message to their moms: Charles wishes his mom knew he wanted to go to ”Harry Potter land,” Ian wanted his mom to know that he likes certain types of flowers because he doesn’t get to go to gardens a lot and Lily wanted her mom (this reporter!) to know she ”loses her cookies” too quickly. Related: The impact of a grandparent deficit on older parents  And what does she mean by ”losing her cookies?”  ”It means she gets mad too quickly,” said Lily, who suggested I should ”eat a piece of cheese and calm down.” Molly wanted her mom to know that she really misses her when she is on vacation or away. Lorelei wanted her mom to know how much she misses her while she is in school. ”Sometimes I kind of feel like I’m going to cry,” she said about that feeling of missing her mom.  Sawyer wanted his mom to know she’s the ”best mom ever” and that he scraped his knee. Claire wanted her mom to know that when her mom asks her to read when she takes the dog for a quick walk, she first checks her texts. ”I don’t think she’ll be mad,” said Claire about when her mom finds out. ”She’ll just laugh.” Romy said she loves her mom ”up to space and back again,” Chloe said ”to the hottest sun in the world,” Avery said probably even more than opening her arms as wide as they could go. And Becca said, if she marked her love with a scale from the ugly duckling to the swan, she’d pick the swan. To all the ”swans” who give so much love to their children, Happy Mother’s Day. Our gift to you are the complete responses from 24 remarkable boys and girls. 1. ”I hope my mother knows that I love her more than she loves me.”    Riya  2. ”I wish my mom knew I miss her in school.”    Lorelei, 3. ”I wish my mom knew that when she tells me to read when she takes my dog out I first check my texts.”    Claire, 4. ”I wish my mama knew I love her so much as the sky, like I am a big heart. I love mama.”    Chloe, 5. ”I wish my mother knew that I like certain types of flowers because I don’t get to visit gardens a lot.”    Ian  6. ”I wish my mommy knew how much I loved her and flowers.”    William  7. ”I wish my mother knew she gives good hugs too.”    Ty, 8. ”I hope my mom knows I love her a lot.”    Avery, 9. ”I wish my mommy knew that I would like to go to Harry Potter land.”    Charles, 10. ”I wish my mom knew that she is the best mom ever and that I scraped my knee.”    Sawyer, 11. ”I wish my mother knew she means the world to me, that is true.”    Becca, 12. ”I wish my mom knew that one of my favorite things is when something happens and we stare at each other and we crack up which makes it more funny.”    Phoebe, 13. ”I wish my mom knew that she is hilarious and helpful, loveable and amazing.”    Hattie, 14. ”I wish my mom knew how much I loved her.”    Rafael  15. ”I wish my mommy knew that I love her.”    Jaime, 16. ”I hope my mom knows that I love her even when I am mad at her.”    Romy  17. ”I wish my mom knew that she is a great cook.”    Aaron, 18. ”I wish my mother knew how tough and amazing she is because she always supports me.”    Madalee, 19. ”I wish my mother knew that I love her so much that I cannot explain how much I love her.”    Sophia, 20. ”I wish my mom knew how much I love her.

      " 'Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been the de facto standard for\\nnowadays 3D medical image segmentation. The convolutional operations used in\\nthese networks, however, inevitably have limitations in modeling the long-range\\ndependency due to their inductive bias of locality and weight sharing. Although\\nTransformer was born to address this issue, it suffers from extreme\\ncomputational and spatial complexities in processing high-resolution 3D feature\\nmaps. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that efficiently bridges a\\n{\\\\bf Co}nvolutional neural network and a {\\\\bf Tr}ansformer {\\\\bf (CoTr)} for\\naccurate 3D medical image segmentation. Under this framework, the CNN is\\nconstructed to extract feature representations and an efficient deformable\\nTransformer (DeTrans) is built to model the long-range dependency on the\\nextracted feature maps. Different from the vanilla Transformer which treats all\\nimage positions equally, our DeTrans pays attention only to a small set of key\\npositions by introducing the deformable self-attention mechanism. Thus, the\\ncomputational and spatial complexities of DeTrans have been greatly reduced,\\nmaking it possible to process the multi-scale and high-resolution feature maps,\\nwhich are usually of paramount importance for image segmentation. We conduct an\\nextensive evaluation on the Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond the Cranial Vault (BCV)\\ndataset that covers 11 major human organs. The results indicate that our CoTr\\nleads to a substantial performance improvement over other CNN-based,\\ntransformer-based, and hybrid methods on the 3D multi-organ segmentation task.\\nCode is available at \\\\def\\\\UrlFont{\\\\rm\\\\small\\\\ttfamily}\\n\\\\url{https://github.com/YtongXie/CoTr}'\n",
      " 'Hayley Peterson writes at the Business Insider:  Target is facing a nationwide backlash for its support of transgender rights. More than 1. 2 million people have signed a pledge to boycott the retailer after it announced last month that it would welcome transgender customers to use any bathroom or fitting room that matches their gender identity. Critics have been holding protests and demonstrations at stores across the country, and they are showing no signs of dying down. Many are demanding access to bathrooms of the opposite sex to support claims that “perverts” can now prey on children and women as a result of the policy. The boycotters’ goal is to force Target to reverse its policy, or at least make the retailer suffer for it by spending their money elsewhere. Read the rest of the story here.'\n",

Ask your father. Ask me what? Do you think you\\'ll have time to finish building the tree house ever? Yeah, Dad. It\\'s kind of been halfway done for two months now. All right. I want to, it\\'s just I got a lot of things going on at work right now. But as soon as I\\'m done, I\\'m on it. I promise. Hang in there. Hey, look at Sundance wrestle his duck. Oh, no, that\\'s not wrestling. That\\'s something you shouldn\\'t know about for another 10 to 30 years. Ten for you. Thirty for you. Hey, Michael? I\\'ll see you tonight at the swim meet? Swim meet. - I gotta go to that? - Yes. - I\\'m kidding you. I\\'ll be there. Okay? - All right. I love you, Michael. Forever and ever, babe. Mr. Newman. Kevin O\\'Doyle. Yeah. Always a pleasure. What kind of stereo you got in that blue piece of shit? You know what? I never checked, Kevin. Yeah, well, my father\\'s stereo is a Bose. Your father\\'s stereo blows? That\\'s too bad. No!

Prince Habeeboo drive red Lamborghini. Red Lamborghini? I meant blue Ferrari. Is this one of your partners? Actually, Michael is just an associate. But he is one of our brightest young architects. Thank you. Walk His Majesty through our design concept. With pleasure. - Prince Haboobee... - Habeeboo! Prince Habeeboo. Habeeboo. I thought I said that. When Mr. Ammer explained to me the type of man you are... ...a visionary who prides himself on originality... ...I said to myself, \"Let\\'s smash the mold and redefine elegance.\" So I present to you your restaurant. Where is... Where\\'s bar? Bar is... Here\\'s the bar. Now, the waterfall... Make bar longer. Okay. We could cut into the atrium a little bit. No atrium. Just make bar longer for Prince Habeeboo. Really? - Still itchy? - You got it. And put big drain in floor for wet T-shirt contest. Now, you\\'re kidding me, right? Boob water\\'s gotta go someplace, Michael.

Whoa, what are you, half a dolphin or something? That was incredible. You just got here, Dad. I saw you. What do you mean I just got here? Why are you saying that? I saw you. You jumped in there, you swam here. - Then what stroke was he doing, Dad? - He was doing the shut-up. Hey. Good thing is, Daddy was here to see you finish. He didn\\'t see me finish. He was hanging out with Ping Woo for some reason. - Yeah, what was that about, huh? - The kid was drowning. I\\'m gonna let him drown? Nobody goes drowning in my pool. How you doing? Bill Herlihy. Ben\\'s coach. You must be Dad. Michael Speedo... Michael Newman. Sorry. Big Ben, that was great progress out there, huh? Just remember, right arm out, head turns left. Left arm out... Head turns right. I know. I just forgot at the end. Well, that\\'s all right. You master that, people are gonna think you\\'re a half a dolphin out there. - Really? - Yeah. Cute. Hello? Mr. Ammer.

Besides, the woodland creatures will laugh at you... ...if you collapse trying to put up the tent this weekend. Yeah. I forgot to tell you. We gotta postpone the camping trip. Ammer put me on a project. It\\'s due Tuesday. If I don\\'t finish, I\\'m off it, so... The kids have been talking about camping all year. Think I don\\'t know that? It\\'s just every choice I make, everything I do... ...I disappoint somebody. Make sure you don\\'t keep disappointing the wrong people. I\\'m not out drinking or gambling or hitting on chicks. I\\'m working my ass off so my family can have a better life... ...than I dreamed of when I was a kid. The only way for that to happen is for me to watch this stinking show! So relax, hon. Are you kidding me? Will you give me a break one time? Damn it! The O\\'Doyles got a stinking universal remote control. We\\'re gonna have one too. I\\'m sick of this. You want me to open the garage for you? Closed. Closed. Open. Bed Bath & Beyond it is. Hey, man? You guys got any universal remote controls in there? - For a shower curtain or a bathmat? - For a television. I don\\'t think so. Maybe for a blanket? You got a remote for a blanket? Sorry, I don\\'t work here. I\\'m waiting for my friends. You\\'re kidding me. Actually, yes. I don\\'t have any friends. Will you be my friend? Wow, man. Bed. Bed. Bath. Bath. Bed. So tired of my life. Beyond? Sorry to sneak up on you. I just... You guys got a universal remote control back here? Something stinks like stale french fries. All right, that\\'s probably me. You know, fast food shortens your life. Yeah, that\\'s what I heard. But the way my life\\'s been going lately, that ain\\'t such a bad thing. You\\'re looking for a universal remote control? Yeah. Just one device to do it all for me... ...make my life a little easier, quicker, not so damn complicated. I\\'m not supposed to do this, but you seem like a good guy. Hey. Somebody noticed. Thank you. I\\'m gonna show you a remote we just got in... ...that\\'s probably the most advanced piece of technology... ...we have in this place. - Sounds sweet. - It is sweet. The latest, greatest universal remote not even on the market yet. I guess the O\\'Doyles\\' remote can bite my advanced-technological ass then. I don\\'t know the O\\'Doyles... ...but they can bite it hard. Yeah. Come in the back with me. Okay. This is... This is very nice of you. - What\\'s your name, anyways? - Call me Morty. Morty, I\\'m Michael Newman. Michael Newman. I\\'m about to rock your world. Okay. I gotta be honest with you. This place looks bigger from the outside. Just kidding. Hey, hey. I think maybe there in the middle? Sneaky. Where\\'s the box? Does it come with directions? Not necessary. Just point, click. Eventually, it will program itself. How much is this thing? Because I ain\\'t exactly Thurston Howell, you know? Lucky for you, it\\'s not in the bar-code system yet. So I\\'m gonna have to just give it to you. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What\\'s the catch here, man? Want me to take my shirt off for you? Because I don\\'t play for that team. Hey. Man, get out of here. Why are you doing this, then? Because good guys need a break every once in a while. Take it. Enjoy. All right. Only one thing you need to know, Michael. This item is nonreturnable. Why would I wanna return something I got for free? Twinkie. You don\\'t need it. You don\\'t need it, man. You do need a Yodel, though. Okay. Good job. Let\\'s see what you got, mate. Look at me, turning my own TV on. I\\'m a freaking whiz kid. - Residential architecture... - So I talked to the kids. - Oh, yeah? They\\'re very understanding about not going camping this weekend. - Great. - They could have a sleepover instead. That\\'s a great idea. Thank you, thank you. Thanks for being so cool about this too. - Can I ask you something? - Yes. After you do all this work and become a big player at your company... ...do you think you\\'re gonna have more time for us... ...or are things just gonna get even more out of control? Wait. When I get to that place and become a boss... ...a millionaire, a big shot, the first thing I\\'m gonna do... ...is hire a bunch of idiots just like me to do all my work. So then you, me and the kids can do whatever the hell we want. You just gotta give me some time. Don\\'t give me that look. I\\'m just saying, give me some support. All right? I love you. Go to sleep. - Just think about it, Michael. - Absolutely. And stop with the Yodels. - You\\'re gonna wake up 400 pounds. - Okay. Hey, hey, hey. Keep it down, dude. Everybody\\'s sleeping. You gotta poop again? Why don\\'t you do the humpy-pumpy on the duck, okay? Will you just hold it in for five minutes and keep the freaking volume down? I guess when you combine... ...mass quantities of cough syrup with Yodels... ...you get acid. Go. Hey, you said you gotta go. Go already, man. Sniffy Longdroppings, today. Holy motherfu...! Yeah, I mean, you\\'re right. In the short run... ...plastic surgery is a hassle. But six months later... ...l\\'m gonna have a face and a body... ...that\\'s gonna get me to places where I wanna be. Oh, my mother, typical, you know, she says: \"Oh, this procedure is too risky.\" If Samantha wanted her cheekbones shaved down, I think I\\'d freak out too. I know, but I just think, you know, they\\'re too Slavic. You should get some work done. Then maybe Michael will wanna hang out with you too. Morning, Michael. You\\'re looking very crappy today. Morning, Janine, you\\'re looking very Slavic. You\\'re just jealous because Donna and I are going to the gym... ...and all the guys are gonna be hitting on us. Michael knows he\\'s my one and only. Forever and ever, babe. Sorry about last night. And I love you. I\\'m s... Oh, my God. I want that so bad. A husband that I can kiss and love and give juice to. You\\'ve already cheated on three different husbands with their brothers. I think you\\'ve given enough juice to everybody. Love juice. You know way too much about me. I should never have done that Montel Williams show. Even Montel Williams thinks you\\'re crazy... ...and he\\'s seen a lot of shit. I was desperate for companionship! All of my husbands... All of them have emotionally abandoned me. They went to work. You had sex with their unemployed brothers. - You\\'re a horndog. - Michael. - Okay, sweetie. Calm it down. - No, no! I have had self-esteem issues since I was a kid. I had a rabbit named Pepper. And that rabbit abandoned me too! Even the rabbit did! Even the rabb... Don\\'t look at me! - What\\'s wrong with me? - Bunny rabbit, bunny... Here\\'s the pitch to Matsui. A deep drive. Oh, my, it\\'s out of here! A two-run shot into the right-field seats for Hideki Matsui. I\\'m sorry. What was that? She has so many problems. Why do you have to be so mean? I don\\'t know, l... Hello. I gotta go. Yeah, good RoboDog. And he can bark in over six different languages. It\\'s so cool. Yeah, it\\'s much cooler than your stupid, human dog. Hey, Dad, see Kevin\\'s new robot dog? Yeah, yeah. Very nice. \"Very nice\"? This thing is worth more than your car. - Not anymore it ain\\'t. - RoboDog! Hey, hey, hey. Okay. Is this some sort of reality show? Are you the host? Morty? Where are the cameras? Got everybody in on it, huh? Sundance did very well also. All right, America! Have your laugh! I\\'m an idiot! Donna, I\\'m gonna get you! Fast-forward. Nobody\\'s laughing at you, Michael. You wanted a universal remote control that remote-controls your universe. Yeah, but what controls my dance skills? Oh, Morty likes it too. Michael, just hit menu. On the remote? No, the menu at the Red Lobster. Yes, on the remote. Where are we? - Go, Michael, go! - One Mississippi. Two Mississippi. - What have I got here? - Two, three. Cough syrup\\'s kicking in again. - We have a boy! - Is it gonna work? What is this? - All right, I love you, Michael. - Your life menu. My life has a commentary? It\\'s chock-full of goodies. - Click it. - Click it. This is last Tuesday. Michael was eagerly awaiting the arrival of his lunch order. Who\\'s that, James Earl Jones? James Earl does a lot of voice-over work. But his anticipation quickly turned to dismay... ... as he realized Alice had brought him a cheeseburger... ... instead of a hamburger as he requested. A cheeseburger? I said a hamburger. She always does this to me. Michael considered demanding that Alice scrape the cheese off... ... but decided not to... ... fearing that Alice may spit in... ... or otherwise defile the burger in some manner. A wise decision... ... for that was exactly what Alice was planning to do. - Are you kidding me? - Sneaky. My God. What else we got here? - \"Making of\"? - Just click. Hey, hey, psychedelic. Where are we? Is this a porno or something? Oh, Ted. Oh, Teddy! Is that my parents? They\\'re making you. Like bunny rabbits. - That\\'s the spot. - Smack my heinie! Change the channel! How do you do this? I can\\'t see. - What happened? - What...? The floor is so mushy and slippery. Feels good on my feet. Check it out. You hit the fast-forward button. I believe we\\'re sometime after your conception. Okay, very good, Mrs. Newman. No! We\\'re in my mother\\'s vagina? Again. And push. - It\\'s a girl. - It\\'s a girl! - Oh, It\\'s a girl. Thank you so much. - Thank you for that. Wait a minute. I\\'m sorry, it might be a boy. What do you mean, \"might be\"? What is that? Maybe that\\'s a penis. Maybe that\\'s a pe...? That\\'s a penis. That\\'s my penis. Can I see that? Can you bring that a little closer? See? - That\\'s a tiny schmeckel. - Yeah? - We have a boy! - We have a boy! Your mother must have some superpower eyesight... ...because I didn\\'t see anything. Let\\'s get out of here. So if you think about it... ...I can reexperience any part of my life I want to. It\\'s amazing. What happened? Oh, God, what did I do? Hello? How do I get you back here, pal? Gotcha. I\\'m not freaked out enough? It\\'s simple. Think of a time and a place... ...hit rewind, and you\\'re there. Time and a place. Time and a place. Oh, my God. Lake Winnipesaukee. That\\'s me in the Jets shirt. Go, little me, go! Good hands! Nice hands. Michael! Michael, dinner\\'s almost ready. Invite your friends if you want to. So any of you wanna come by my tent for some supper? Or we could eat at my Winnebago and watch Three\\'s Company. Three\\'s Company. That\\'s humiliating. Mom, why can\\'t we camp in an RV like every other family? Oh, come on. You call that camping? How can you get close to nature in a tin can like that? Plus, it\\'s more fun to have to keep each other warm at night. Don\\'t you know it. - No cupcakes yet. - But I\\'m starving. I agree with you, Michael. You know how hungry I am? I am so hungry, I could eat this. Oh, this is where the quarter trick started. How the heck did he do that? Oh, it\\'s a trick coin you buy at a magic shop. I just couldn\\'t let him know I knew that. That\\'s sweet. Now, I gotta get back to work, so hit play. It\\'s a very powerful device. Use it with caution. Okay. Who are you? You know who I am. Morty? If you have any questions... ...call me. No, Linda, I think Stacy gets the most-beautiful-feet award. You wanted to see me? Michael. Look, I\\'m heading out to the Hamptons in a couple of minutes. I\\'m counting on you. This hotel project? It\\'s a big fish. You reel it in for me and it\\'s \"Howdy, partner.\" Okay. Thank you. Screw it up, though, and it\\'s \"Back to the mailroom, atrium boy.\" Mr. Ammer, Denise just called. She\\'s gotta go to rehab again, so she can\\'t make it to the Hamptons. I\\'m gonna be alone on the Fourth of July? Mr. Ammer, if you need female companionship this weekend... ...my wife\\'s friend Janine, wow. Really? What\\'s she like? Let\\'s just say she will eat you up, sir. Excuse me. I\\'m sorry to interrupt... ...but this is kind of important. - Okay. - Go to the bathroom. - Okay. Dude! You suck so bad. Do not. Hey, Dad. How you doing, buddy? Playing some catch? Actually, we\\'re playing some drop, because Ben hasn\\'t caught one yet. Darn it. You\\'re a regular Derek Jeter yourself, O\\'Doyle. - Love you, kid. - Love you too, Dad. Mommy! No, I know. Well, I thought she should\\'ve gotten voted off. But did you see her Kate Spade handbag? It was gorgeous. Wait, hold on a second, Trudy. I gotta say hi to your son. - I told your parents to come for dinner. - Really? That sounds good. It\\'d be fun for them to be here for the sleepover. Okay, so great. Yeah. We\\'ll see you guys later. Okay, bye-bye. It\\'s not gonna kill you to eat dinner with your family, sweetie. I know, I just gotta build an entire model tonight. - I\\'m the leader! - No, I\\'m the leader! Go say hi to Daddy. Go on. I can\\'t take a whole night of this. - And I\\'m not going to. - Q, R, S, T, U... Cool. I can skip chapters. What a family. All right, let\\'s get dinner over with. Next. Next. Everyone\\'s done but you, buddy. Let\\'s go. Will you stop already? Oh, boy, Dad\\'s quarter trick. I can\\'t wait not to see it. Alone in my basement at last. Should I do my work and become partner now? I think so. Let\\'s get to it. - Michael? - Yo. We don\\'t wanna interrupt. We\\'re taking off. Thanks for a great night. You had a fun time hanging out with me? That was... We did good, right? - Good night, honey. - Love you. My schmeckel got bigger now that I\\'m older, just so you guys know that. It couldn\\'t have gotten any smaller. Yeah, yeah. It looked like a little Tic Tac. Yeah, come here, I\\'ll freshen your breath. - Bye, you guys. - Bye, sweetie. Good night, sweetie. Great dinner, honey. See? Was that so bad? Kidding me? I had fun. Good for you. Can you watch the gang for 10 minutes while I clean up? Can\\'t you? I just... I got so much stuff to do here. Oh, you got stuff to do? I got ghost stories, charades, the dishes... ...and then I gotta sew the duck\\'s head back on for Sundance... ...and fix his butthole. Way to go, champ. I wish I had time to do all that stuff. Give me a break, Michael. You\\'re a big boy. You set your own priorities. I\\'m asking for 10 minutes, not for, like, a whole day. You don\\'t have to do that much. How big a deal is that? I am so tired of having this argument. I skipped the whole fight. Babe? - I can\\'t sleep. - You can\\'t? I feel bad that we keep arguing. I know. Don\\'t be upset, okay? - I was a jerk. - You are a jerk. - I love you. - I love you too. - Yes. That smells good. - What? Michael. Stop it. The sleepover will catch us. They ain\\'t gonna hear us. Come on. Okay. Quietly try and coax me into it. I gotta get back to work. Can\\'t we just do it? No, we can\\'t just do it. Honey, come on. I mean, I don\\'t have any new moves for you. It\\'s the same stuff. Just think of last time and use that. I like the old moves. Come on. All right. This time you be Sundance, I\\'ll be the duck. - Yeah? - But you gotta massage me first. Great, I love giving massages. Massaging away here. Oh, that feels good. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. - We did it? - Well, you did. I didn\\'t want the whole thing to go that fast. I don\\'t think anybody did. Yeah. I\\'ll get you next time. Thanks. So we good for tomorrow? What are you talking about? At dinner. You said we\\'d go to lunch tomorrow and pick out your dad\\'s birthday gift. Dad\\'s gift is... - Of course. I said so, so I\\'ll be there. - Okay. - Need another massage or anything? - Oh, go away. I gotta go work. Hey, Morty. It\\'s Michael Newman. Yeah, can I talk to you for a minute? Hang on for a second, someone\\'s at my door. - Hello, Michael. - Where\\'d you come from? You don\\'t wanna know. - Can we take a walk? - Sure. It\\'s simple. You must have been on autopilot. Autopilot? That\\'s what happens to you when you fast-forward. - Okay. - Yeah. I\\'ll show you. Here. See? That\\'s you on autopilot. The lights are on but nobody\\'s home. The remote lets your mind skip around... ...but your body actually stays put for the boring stuff. We should go to lunch tomorrow and pick out your dad\\'s birthday gift. Sounds good. So she did tell me. I\\'m having conversations on autopilot, then. You\\'re not gonna be the life of the party, but yes. Everyone goes on autopilot now and then. The big difference is now you\\'ve got a nifty remote... ...to help you decide when. This thing is the best. By the way, your wife? Absolutely gorgeous. - She is, isn\\'t she? - Perfect face. Tight, rocking body. You okay? - Amazing. - What is? She fell for a schlub like you. I\\'m a schlub? I don\\'t know about that, pal. I see a good-looking man right there. You wanna see what a stud I used to be? Yeah? All right, let\\'s take a look at some of the girls... ...I used to fool around with before I met Donna. Is that a man or a woman? It\\'s a woman. What is this, Animal Planet? - Stop. - Yes. Sometimes it\\'s better to keep certain memories just in your head. So I\\'ve learned, Morty. Good night. Thank you. Good night, Michael. I\\'m getting sick, man. Fast-forward me till I\\'m better. Michael, honey, wake up. You\\'ll be late for work. What? It\\'s Monday already? Are you kidding me? No more phlegm? I skipped an entire cold? Thanks to you, baby! I love you! No more Tylenol! I don\\'t remember doing any work this weekend. But apparently I did. - Bad news. There\\'s no hot water. - What? I gotta take a shower. Well, you\\'re gonna freeze your bun-buns off. It\\'s all good. Yes! Look at me. All showered and dressed and looking sexy. I like that. L... Did you smoke crack, Daddy? Just watch your toons and have a great day with Mommy today, okay? Eating cupcakes like your old man. Right here, baby. - Dad? - Yes, sir? Are you gonna have to work late again tonight? - Unfortunately, yes. - Is there anything we can do to help? Well, I\\'m gonna be partner soon, and I\\'m gonna need new building designs. So if you guys have any cool ideas, draw them up for me. - Okay. - Rock \\'n\\' roll. - I get the paper. - I got the crayons. Would you stop talking and fix the sewer? You\\'re on it now, yeah. Yeah. Traffic, traffic, no more traffic. Wait a sec! Here we go! Mama! Yeah! That\\'s what I\\'m talking about, baby! You look a little pale there, pal. Let me fix that. Oh, look at you now. You\\'re all yellow from the scurvy. Captain. Don\\'t get the Hulk angry. You won\\'t like him when he\\'s angry. Oh, there\\'s Barney. I love you, you love me That jogger had giant boobies Okay. Let\\'s get you that tan you been searching for. That\\'s it. That\\'s it. Check out Julio Iglesias... Pretty. - Looking good, Mr. Newman. - Really? Thank you very much, Judy. - Finish? - Did I finish? I believe I finished. - Let\\'s see here. Look at that. - Very impressive, Michael. Yeah, the river in the lobby. This is actually pretty good, man. Where did you find the time to get a tan? - I guess I can do it all, sir. - You can do it all. All right, all right, everybody. It\\'s sexual-harassment-speech day. Now, anyone can be a victim of sexual harassment: Blue collar, white collar, a woman, a man. Even the office slut. Not that I\\'m mentioning any names... ...Stacy. Here we go. Sexual harassment can come in many forms. You see, what is hilarious to some, could be offensive to others. Let me try to give you a real-life example because I\\'m sure I\\'ve done it. Like the day I said, \"You want a promotion, break out the lotion.\" I was technically engaged in sexual harassment. Hilarious sexual harassment, if you ask me. Now, there is also homosexual harassment. Now, this is like when one dude comes up to another... ...and says something cheeky. - This will be good. Proceed. I don\\'t know about you Americans... ...but to me there is no doubt... ...lchiro is the greatest of all time. Yeah, he\\'s incredible. You gotta admit, you can always count on Matsui. Oh, Matsui. Well, if you guys love Ichiro and Matsui so much, let\\'s order them both. I\\'ll eat anything. - Excuse us for a moment. - Absolutely, Mr. Watsuhita. See you guys in a bit. Ichiro and Matsui are baseball players. You just insulted their national heroes. I\\'m going to the bathroom to slit my wrists. I\\'ll be here. These morons are so boring. They make me wanna chop my own dick off. That hotel design? I\\'d like to rip it up. Egghead watched a bad documentary on Asian architecture. Who needs a stupid river in the lobby? Let\\'s build more rooms and maximize profits. Eat as fast as you can. Then we can get out of here... ...and do Jell-O shots at America\\'s greatest cultural achievement: T.G.I. Friday\\'s. T.G.I. Friday\\'s! - All right, Michael, save us. - I\\'m all over it, baby. Before we order, I was looking at our proposal. You know what? After getting to know you a little bit, I realize this is not what you\\'re about. In fact, let\\'s just throw it out, all right? Start from scratch. The river in the lobby idea, what an egghead move. Let\\'s just keep the plans simple, forget all the niceties, maximize our revenue. That\\'s what it\\'s all about anyways, the profits. But do me a favor. Just give us your account and your trust. That way we can get the hell out of this dump, go to T.G.I. Friday\\'s... ...do some Jell-O shots till this guy pukes up a lung. Fuck, yeah. That\\'s what I\\'m talking about. Yes, yes! The king is home! Hello, hello! How can you goons sleep when you know I got you presents? - You did? - What is it? What is it? Well, if you bring your tushies downstairs, we\\'ll find out. I\\'m coming. I\\'m coming. Honey, get your sweet little buns downstairs too. Come on, come on! Come and get them. - Awesome! No way! - Yeah, yeah. - It must have cost a million dollars! - That\\'s chump change now. You guys deserve the best... ...and that\\'s what you\\'re gonna get from now on, okay? What\\'s all this? Look who\\'s here. You guys wanna ride these bikes? - Yeah! - Let\\'s take them outside! Wake the O\\'Doyles, let them see what you got. These are the coolest bikes in the whole town. Kevin O\\'Doyle\\'s gonna shit himself. - Don\\'t think I forgot my beautiful wife. - Oh, my gosh. It\\'s not a bike or a cowboy hat, but you\\'re gonna like this, I hope. - Oh, Michael, it\\'s beautiful. - I heard you talking to my mother. - I love it! - You look good, baby. I got myself a celebratory cigar too. Why not? What are we celebrating? \"What are we celebrating?\" We\\'re healthy, we got a great family... ...l\\'m Ammer\\'s newest partner... Oh, my God, you\\'re kidding! Honey, congratulations! I knew it! I knew you\\'d be psyched! I love it! I love you! I single-handedly landed the Watsuhita account. That\\'s incredible. I knew it was gonna be a great day. - I heard our song on the radio. - We have a song? Honey. The song that was playing during our first kiss. Come on. You\\'re kidding me, right? I know our song. Our song. Of course I know our song. Our song is... What the hell was that song? I remember this place. And... Oh, my God. Wolverine\\'s goofy cousin. But look at you. Wow. You are out of his league, aren\\'t you? Oh, yeah, the notes. Smooth, buddy. Oh, look at her. What\\'s gonna happen? You got an answer to that? Okay. Seal the deal, pal. All she\\'s thinking about is, \"I am not kissing that beard. Absolutely not, that\\'s gonna hurt me.\" Wait a minute. Yeah, Newman. Get it. Yeah. Donna! Donna. Oh, my God. I\\'m so horny now. Oh, God, I\\'m not. Get me out of here. \"Linger\" by The Cranberries was playing during our first juicy kiss. And, my God, you looked beautiful in that pink sweater you were wearing. Honey, you remember what I was wearing? Of course. I remember what Janine was wearing. She scared the shit out of me then. I love you. I love you too, honey. Hi, Mr. Newman. Right this way, Michael. Hey, my new star. Congratulations. Sit down, big guy. All right. I am a little tired. The family was up late last night celebrating. You really knocked one out of the park last night, didn\\'t you? Hey, you were great too. All you gotta do is draw up the construction plans. If Watsuhita commits to the bulk of the funds... ...l\\'m looking at my new partner. I thought I was already your partner. Whoa, cowboy. I said, \"Land the Watsuhita account, you\\'ll get promoted.\" - I didn\\'t mean right this second. - But I already told my wife, sir. I spent money I don\\'t have. To do these documents is gonna take me months. Then you better get started. Wow, I just got a big headache! - Was I hit by a train or something? - I didn\\'t see anything. I forgot to tell you. I hung out with your friend Janine this weekend. I hope she\\'s doing your brother right now, you big-headed buffoon. No, no, no. You got more. Yeah. Anyway, the sooner you get back to work... ...the sooner you\\'ll be partnerized. - I taste shit. - You do? Stacy! Did you put shit in my lunch? I\\'m gonna get going now, sir. Stacy! Have you considered the consequences... ...of the thing you\\'re thinking about doing? Yeah. What are you saying, I shouldn\\'t do it? It\\'s your life. What you do with the remote is your decision, Michael. I know, so, I mean, we\\'re talking a couple of months here. I fast-forward through it, what am I gonna miss? Thirty arguments and a haircut? Remember the leprechaun? The one from the cereal ad. \"They\\'re magically delicious.\" That guy? He\\'s always chasing the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. But when he gets there at the end of the day... ...it\\'s just corn flakes. - Michael. - Yes. - You don\\'t understand the metaphor? - I won\\'t do it, all right. - Dad? - Yeah. - We have some designs for you. - It\\'s not a good time, man. Maybe they\\'ll help you finish quicker. All right. You want me to look at it? Let me see. The ceiling\\'s too high, the hallway\\'s too narrow... ...stairway placement makes no sense at all. - What the hell\\'s this room made of? - Pizza. Well, it\\'s stupid. Next. What is yours made of? - Pickles. - Oh, don\\'t be a baby. Michael, have you lost your mind? He\\'s 7 years old. If he wants a playroom made of pizza, then why not? Maybe he\\'s gotta grow up sometime and get the hell off Fantasy Island. Hey, pizza boy. Life ain\\'t about being creative. It\\'s about kissing ass, playing it safe, making your boss a lot of money... ...in hopes one day he might throw you a stinking bone. All right? Yes, sir. Ammer didn\\'t make you partner, did he? Oh, honey, I\\'m so sorry. But we\\'ll get through this, okay? I promise. Jeez! Man, that\\'s all we ever do is get through it. When is it gonna end? Pretty sweet, eh? Two queen beds, full kitchen, steam shower... ...and satellite TV with surround sound. Why are you always trying to hurt me? One day I\\'m gonna hurt you back. Michael Newman, I didn\\'t know you smoked cigars. And now\\'s the time. No, Kathy, this isn\\'t mine. I took it out of Kevin\\'s hands. Yeah, he was smoking like a chimney. No, I wasn\\'t! I think I smell marijuana in it. Kevin O\\'Doyle, you get your ass in this house right now! I hate you. Are you deaf? Move it! I don\\'t wanna have to ask you again! Dope is for dopes, buddy! Get your ass in this house! We don\\'t have any other choice, guys. - No fair! I don\\'t wanna return my bike! - We have to, honey. - But Daddy gave them to us! - Because he loves you. Unfortunately, there was a mix-up at Daddy\\'s work. We need to bring the bikes back for now. But I already told Kevin O\\'Doyle I got a new bike. Well, we can paint my old bike and make it look new. That\\'s a girl\\'s bike. All the kids will make fun of me. No! I wanna keep my bike! I can\\'t take this anymore. Fast-forward me to my promotion. So here\\'s to Michael Newman... ...the greatest partner I could ever dream of. Hear, hear! Thank you. Thank you, guys. My family thanks you. I\\'m gonna do the best I can and I won\\'t let you down, I promise. Yeah! - Congratulations, Mr. Newman. - This is great. Thank you. How\\'s it feel, killer? - Feels incredible, sir. - Well, you earned it. I\\'m telling you. Not just because of that Watsuhita project either. For helping me pick up the slack now I\\'m spending time with my lady. Hey, Dinkie. Are you kidding me? You guys have been dating a couple months now? That\\'s pretty huge for this one. No, the first few months were easy. It was the one-year hump that was the tough part. Her inappropriate weekend with my brother in Cabo... ...well, that was a potential speed bump. But, well, Dr. Bergman helped us work through it, didn\\'t he, honey? How\\'s he doing for you and Donna? Dr. Bergman. What do you mean? Oh, you know what, sweetie? It\\'s none of our business. Let\\'s let Michael bask in his glory. Cheers. Bask away, partner. Took that bastard a year to promote me? What else did I miss? - Shit. - Need something, Mr. Newman? - Who are you? - Kirsten, your assistant. What happened to Alice? She moved to Accounting. Couldn\\'t handle your hours. And she prefers to be called Alan now. Remember? No. No. No! And who the hell\\'s Dr. Bergman? And I feel like Michael\\'s making no effort to connect with me at all. No, no. I want to. I want to. It\\'s... I\\'m on autopilot. \"I\\'m on autopilot.\" More like auto-zombie. Good one, Donna. - \"Good one, Donna\"? - Michael, relax. Who is this bigmouth? Why can\\'t you and I just talk? Why? Because there is no talking to you. You\\'re never home to talk to. And when you are, you\\'re just sitting there staring off into space. What do you want from me? This is what happens. He\\'s gonna answer his phone. What the heck happened? I didn\\'t even touch the remote. Great, you gonna start watching TV at dinner? Oh, can we? Samantha. My little angel. Look at you. Look how long your hair\\'s getting. When did you grow up? Ben, get over here. Don\\'t worry. I\\'m not gonna work tonight. Watch Dragon Tales together. What do you say? Dragon Tales is for babies, Dad. I wanna watch CSI. Yeah, CSI. It\\'s the episode when they find the lady\\'s arm. What happened? I missed the whole Dragon Tales era? Whoa, hey, hello. What are you doing? Come here! Give me my Twinkie! Get back here, you freaking gremlin! Don\\'t yell at Peanut because he found your Twinkie stash. Who\\'s Peanut? Where\\'s Sundance? Don\\'t mention Sundance. The kids just stopped crying. About what? Why? What happened? He died? Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no. The stupid idiot and soft fur. - Daddy held it in so long. - He was the best dog! He\\'s finally letting himself feel it. One night when the duck\\'s head was off... ...he tried to hump my leg and I didn\\'t let him... ...and I should\\'ve and I\\'m sorry. - What an idiot. - It\\'s okay, it\\'s okay. What the heck did I do? I love you. Do you still love me? Oh, Michael. It\\'s been... I\\'m really confused. No, no, no. I\\'ll change, okay? I\\'ll be a better man, I promise. Don\\'t go, don\\'t go. I\\'ll stop working so much, okay? I\\'ll be with you. Just stay with me. Oh, my God, it didn\\'t take the duck long to get over Sundance. It\\'s a little deviant, but it\\'s kind of turning me on. Yeah, well, let\\'s kiss and make up. No. No! It\\'s not my fault. It jumped on its own. I didn\\'t even hit the button. Not even close. Yes? - You scared... - Honey, what\\'s going on down there? It\\'s all right! L... There was a mouse! I killed it! It\\'s dead! But it broke the table first! - How did you get in here? - I had a feeling you wanted to see me. I\\'m freaking out. This thing, it\\'s broken. It\\'s just... It\\'s fast-forwarding on its own now. It\\'s not a malfunction, it\\'s a feature. It\\'s using its memory to execute your preferences. It remembers stuff? What do you mean? It\\'s an advanced piece of equipment, like TiVo. You could call it MeVo. I fast-forwarded through sex one time, I don\\'t wanna skip it forever. I like sex. It feels good. Correct me if I\\'m wrong, but you fast-forwarded through an entire year. That\\'s a lot of sex. Put it all together, that\\'s like 30 minutes\\' worth for you. Oh, no, no. So what, everything I fast-forwarded... ...it\\'s gonna do it on its own now? - Pretty much. No more showering, no more traffic. No more arguing. No more sickness. This is bad, this is bad. You take it back, I\\'m deactivating my service. I quit, I quit. Thanks for everything, all right, but l... Yeah. You... This is not... Don\\'t be mean. Nice hat. No, no, no. Get away from me. Just get away. Get away. Leave me alone. Is this a stickup? Or are you just happy? Yeah? I\\'m gonna take my clothes off, then... I wouldn\\'t do that if I were you. There\\'s only one place left for it to pop up. Oh. No, no, I don\\'t want that. Come on, man. I told you, this item is nonreturnable. - Come on, just take it. - Until we meet again. Don\\'t do that. Come on, Morty. How do I get it to stop fast-forwarding? Morning, sweetie. You wanna shower first? Yeah. No! I can\\'t shower because then I\\'ll fast-forward. And if I fast-forward, who knows how long I\\'ll fast-forward for. How\\'s this? I\\'m gonna rough it today, like in the Old West. Okay? Donna, I wanna tell you what\\'s going on right now so bad... ...but it might lead to an argument. We can\\'t argue because off I\\'ll go. So just know there is a problem. I tried to get rid of the problem, it almost ended up in my ass. I\\'m gonna go to work and try to figure this out. You\\'re going to work in your bathrobe? Honey. We can\\'t argue, okay? No more arguing. You\\'re right. I\\'m wrong. All the time. You want a kiss? - I\\'ll take a kiss. - I can\\'t. If I give you a kiss... ...it might lead to something else, then... three minutes goes by. You\\'re laying there disappointed, I\\'m smiling. I wanna be with you every minute of my life, that\\'s why I gotta leave now. Have a great day! Once again, Michael left Donna in bed confused and unsatisfied. Shut up, James Earl Jones! No, you shut up, big mouth! Michael! Mr. Ammer is here Your first day as a partner, you come to work in a fricking bathrobe? I did. I did. John, I just feel we should stop wasting our energy... ...on corporate brown-nosing and worrying who\\'s got the better suit. Armani, Calvin Klein, who cares? Let\\'s concentrate on what really matters, the work. That\\'s the craziest thing I\\'ve ever heard. But goddamn it, you\\'re right. Life-changing. I feel freer. Yeah... Keep the pants on. Sexual harassment, eh? Speaking of life-changing... ...there\\'s something, or actually someone, I\\'d like to talk to you about. - Janine. - Everything okay? Michael, Janine and I decided to drop out of the rat race... ...slow down, move to Morocco. - Morocco? - Morocco. Okay. Eric Lamensoff will assume my day-to-day responsibilities... ...and I\\'d like you to take his job. But Eric Lamensoff is the head of the whole international division. - I\\'ve been your partner one day. - So? Every account you worked on turned into gold. You know, I wouldn\\'t be surprised... ...if one day you ended up being our CEO. Hey, I would love for that to happen, but... No! No, no, no! I don\\'t want a promotion! No! Michael, you have a phone call. Michael Newman. Word up, big guy. Ten years ago you told me you wanted to be CEO. Great news. Eric Lamensoff killed himself. So you better stop with the junk food, Mr. Chairman... ... or you\\'ll end up killing yourself too. Opening virtual blinds. Ten years? How much worse can things get? Oh, my God, I\\'m a fat guy! Look at me. What is this? This is titties. I got juicy titties! What... What is that? Oh, God, no. Just take me home. This is 1010 WINS news. February 5th, 2017. Britney Spears had her 23rd baby today. Proud father Kevin Federline says he\\'s now considering getting a job. Also, Michael Jackson, the first man to clone himself... ... is now suing himself for molesting himself. Donna! Donna! Can I help you? - Hey, Dad. - \"Hey, Dad\"? Ben? That\\'s you? Look how big you got. You\\'re enormous. Look who\\'s talking, Captain Twinkie of the S.S. Fat-Ass! Really good for my self-esteem. Maybe if you would take me to Pilates like you said... ...people wouldn\\'t think I was Rosie O\\'Donnell! Come on, I love you! - Bring me back the Twinkies! - You\\'re so cruel! Will you please stop yelling? It is so embarrassing. - Is that my daughter? - Mom, I\\'m going to Derek\\'s! That\\'s you, Samantha? When did you get boobs? The same time you did, Dad. Now can I go? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who the hell\\'s this Derek guy? My boyfriend, the hottest boy in school, hello? He\\'s gonna be hot when I burn his house down. Get your ass upstairs, put normal clothes on. - Why are you so mean to me? - Get them on now! - And wipe off all that makeup! - Right! Is Peanut dead too? This one\\'s got the duck doing all the work. Donna. Donna. Goddamn it. Look how gorgeous you look. I\\'m so scared. - Knock, knock, gang. - Hey, sweetie. What\\'s going on? Donna and I were gonna get hot chocolate. - You want us to bring you one? - You cheating on me? With Johnny G-String over here? Come on. Time-out. I thought we were past that. No, no, no, we\\'re past this argument. No, you\\'re right, no big deal. Hey, it\\'s just that you don\\'t mess with another man\\'s wife! Michael! Stop it! Stop it, Michael! It was your decision to move out! So stay out! Get off me! You sticking up for him? Go away! Go away, I hate you! - We can\\'t argue! Donna, please! - I hate you! I hate you! Oh, man! You hate me? No. No. Ten years, you\\'re not finished yet? Morty! Why did you do this to me? You did this to yourself, Michael. No. No, I didn\\'t wanna waste all that time. I didn\\'t wanna lose Donna! The remote goes by your behavior. Every time you had a conflict between work and home, work won. - No, not true. - Lie to your wife. Lie to yourself. But you cannot lie to the remote. The remote is lie-proof, so you can\\'t change what already happened. But you\\'re still a young man. A young, fat man. You could win Donna back. So that\\'s what I\\'ll do. Go for it, tubs. I saw what you did to the duck. Very good. Nice work. You\\'ll feel that in a second. All right, please, please just read my note. - Hate you! I hate you! I hate you! Michael, are you awake? Michael, honey. Are you awake? Donna. Where\\'d all my fat go? It was just a dream? A terrible, terrible dream. What\\'s that, Michael? You had a bad dream? Did a fuzzy dog push me over? Oh, Shaggy the miracle dog? Yeah, if he hadn\\'t knocked you on your noggin... ...you wouldn\\'t have had the CAT scan that found the cancer before it spread. I have cancer? No, you had cancer. You\\'re the only person to gain weight during chemo. That\\'s probably what caused your heart attack. Heart attack? I thought they weaned you off the morphine. Okay, Mr. Junk Food... ...since the injury, you haven\\'t been healthy a full day. When exactly did I hurt my head? When was it? Like, six years ago? Six more years! No! No! It skipped all my sickness. I\\'m gonna ask them to cut back on painkillers. Donna, don\\'t go. What\\'s this? That\\'s not bad for your third liposuction. One more tummy tuck should take care of it. Oh, it looks like a tongue... ...licking. Look, I should go. Bill\\'s waiting for me downstairs. - So I\\'ll probably... - Bill? You\\'re still with Speedo Torpedo? Whatever happened to \"forever and ever,\" honey? \"Forever and ever\"? Look, Michael, I\\'m trying to have a civilized relationship with you... ...for the kids\\' sake. I really wanna be friends, but I can\\'t do that if you... Would you stop flapping that thing? It\\'s my flap, I\\'ll do whatever the hell I want with it! You done? Look, Bill\\'s my husband. Please learn to accept that. I really have to go. Husband? Donna? No. Donna. Donna. Donna! Welcome to Newman Architecture. Building a better world for all of us. Architect of the year, 2018. All your dreams came true, huh, moron? Dad. Hey, how you feeling? - Benjamin. Look at that. - Look... What? Your face. Your skinny face. You\\'re shaving now, huh, kid? Your entire ass is gone. What happened? Good for you. Right, my ass. Why don\\'t we talk about it in my office. My old office. The architect. How did this happen? - Mom said you were still a little loopy. - No, no, no. I\\'m feeling terrific. The weight. How did you do it? Staple treatment like your old man? Wanna have a flap fight? You gotta see this... No. Just working out with Bill five times a week. Same as always. That\\'s a looker. Blondie, big lips. Chesty. Is that your girl? No, that\\'s your daughter Samantha. Of course it is. And you better always take care of her... ...and make sure nobody touches her except you. Pop, I\\'m just getting ready for this meeting. Okay. Absolutely. I\\'ll take off for you. I\\'d like to spend more time together. All of us. Take you out for ice cream. How\\'s that? I know your mother won\\'t come... ...but you, Samantha, Grandpa, Grandma. That\\'d be nice, huh? I knew something was funny with you today. Papa, take a seat. Let me get you a water, okay? What are we sitting for? - Here you go, Pop, drink this. - All right. Drink some water. There, I had my water. What\\'s going on? Grandpa died, Dad. He died a while back now. No, no, no. Don\\'t say that. Where was I? You\\'re crying? What happened? Nothing. You know, he just got old. That\\'s life. - Shit. - You\\'re born and you live and you die. Man, I gotta go. Hey, hang on. Susie, push my next meeting. No, no, do your meeting. It\\'s fine. I\\'m just dizzy. - Why are you crying? - I\\'m dizzy from the operation. - You\\'re gonna make me cry, Dad. - You don\\'t... You don\\'t have to go. You look... You look good. It\\'s all right. Goodbye. Come on. Come on. It won\\'t take you there. Take me where? To the moment he died. You weren\\'t there. Of course I wasn\\'t. Can you take me to the last time I saw him, please? Hey, Dad. Sorry to bug you. Would you mind looking at my shopping mall design again? This one is cheaper. But if you check this out... ...you\\'ll see it has a much better natural flow... Cheaper one, like I said. Now, just let me do my e-mail. Yeah. Yeah, you\\'re right, Dad. He ain\\'t right. You\\'re a schmuck! Look at it! Surprise. Hey, Grandpa. Oh, my God. When did you get so handsome? So, Michael, I had a wonderful idea. Your mother\\'s playing canasta with her friends tonight. I thought, \"What a great opportunity.\" You, me and Ben should go and have a boys\\' night out. - Can\\'t. - What do you mean you can\\'t? You have to eat sometime. We could go, we could whistle at pretty girls. - I\\'m down for that. - See? He\\'s down. I don\\'t know what it means, but he\\'s down. - Hey. Please. - Don\\'t give me that finger. I\\'ll make you a deal. If you come, I\\'ll show you the quarter trick. - Will you look at the man? - I\\'ll tell you the secret. No, Dad. Don\\'t you wanna know how l...? I know how you do the stupid trick. I\\'ve always known. Can you let me do my work? You\\'ve always known. You\\'re pathetic. Okay. I\\'m so sorry I barged in. I love you, son. See you later, Grandpa, I love you. Dad. Pop. Pop. I love you, son. I love you, son. I love you, son. I love you too, Dad. I\\'ll miss you. You know that. Goodbye. I\\'m sorry about your father. Taking him wasn\\'t something I wanted to do. What do you mean \"taking him\"? I\\'m an angel, Michael. An angel? I thought an angel was supposed to protect people. I\\'m the angel of death. Your dad, it was his time. You bastard. All right, leave me alone. Leave me alone. You had your fun. Just take me to a good place. And now, everybody, it\\'s time for Mr. Newman to say a few words. Yay, Michael! Go get them, Michael! Speech! Wedding cake. Wedding cake. Okay, where\\'s the groom? Show your face. Hi, Dad. Ben. I didn\\'t miss my son\\'s wedding. Wow, this is terrific, buddy. Who\\'s the lucky lady? Very funny, Mr. Newman. Aunt Peggy, is that you? God, you got old. No, no. L... She... I\\'m just playing. She knows that. Ma. Ben\\'s wife... ...welcome to the family. Thank you. Congratulations. Let\\'s have the best night, okay? Look at you, Ma. You look amazing. Michael, you haven\\'t kissed me like that since you were a little boy. You are the best, Ma. You know I know that, right? Oh, darling, that\\'s so sweet. You know, Michael, your father would\\'ve loved to be here. I know, Ma. Okay? I\\'m just glad you\\'re here. Me too, bubbala. Me too. Me too. It\\'s beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Look at her. Donna, my favorite. You\\'re such a schmuck for letting her go. But don\\'t let me ruin your evening. I\\'ll talk to you later. Christina. Michael, you\\'ve been so generous taking care of all this... ...and the kids\\' honeymoon. - Absolutely. - Thank you so much. Of course. Ben\\'s wife seems like a nice kid, huh? - I think she\\'s wonderful. - Definite keeper. Here\\'s one you might remember from The Cranberries. Out of all the songs, huh? Bill, since it\\'s our son\\'s wedding... ...do you mind if I dance with my ex-husband for a minute? - Not at all. - Thank you. Just have her back by midnight, all right, champ? You got it, Bill. Why does he have a bathing suit on? Nice Speedo, buddy. Still smelling good, huh? After all these years. Are you happy? Of course I\\'m happy, our son just got married. Not about that. Are you happy about where our lives ended up? \"Ended.\" It\\'s not over yet. - That\\'s my Donna. - It\\'s true. That Samantha? Hey. What are you doing? Put a sweater on. Cover them up. What is with you? Just kidding, I... Just not used to seeing you all grown-up like this. Okay, well, if that\\'s your way of telling me that I look pretty, then thank you. Let\\'s go get some cake. - I\\'ll race you there, Dad. Come on. - Okay. \"Dad\"? Michael, are you okay? Is there a doctor? We need a doctor here! Michael! - Dad! - Dad! It\\'s just corn flakes. One dance, you pop an artery. Why\\'d you make me waste my entire life? You were fast-forwarding through your life... ...long before you ever met me. You lived the life you chose, big shot. This is not the life I wanted. It is. Looks like it is. Hey. You\\'re up. How you feeling? I feel better now that you guys are here. Samantha\\'s been here like 36 hours straight. She said she wouldn\\'t leave the hospital until you woke up. - Why\\'d you do that? - Because. You\\'re my father. I thought Bill was your father. I have two fathers. One of them told me he was gonna live till he was 200. Remember? You both really need to get some sleep. And I got a plane to catch. Big Ben\\'s gotta go on his honeymoon. Actually, I just canceled the honeymoon. Kensington deal might fall through, so I gotta go do damage control. - Julie and I can go to Italy anytime. - No. It\\'s not that big a deal. - That\\'s not fair to your wife. - Dad... ...she gets it. Keeping the business going is more important. Guys, I\\'m sorry. You\\'re gonna have to leave. He needs his rest. All right. Bye, Dad. Bye, Daddy. Get this off of me. Whoa, whoa! Hey, fella, you\\'re a long way from walking out of here. I gotta see my son. You\\'re not going anywhere. Now, get back into the bed. - Isn\\'t that Colin Farrell? - Where? Michael. Those machines are keeping you alive. I gotta talk to my boy. - Michael, stop. - No. Michael, it doesn\\'t have to end now. Ben! Ben! Ben! Ben! Dad? Dad? Dad, what are you doing? Are you okay? - Oh, my God. - Help! Help! - Dad! Dad! - Help! Ben, Ben. Family. Family. Family. What? Family. Family. Family comes first. Family comes first. Honeymoon. Honeymoon. Honeymoon. I love you. Samantha. Samantha. I didn\\'t make 200, but I love you. I love you. Bill, Bill, Bill. I\\'m sorry. Michael. The note you wrote her, it\\'s in your pocket. Forever and ever, babe. It\\'s time to go. - Where am I? - You\\'re in Bed Bath & Beyond, sir. I was just watching you sleep. You looked like you were having a crazy dream. What? You\\'re not supposed to lay in the beds, but I do sometimes. I\\'m back in the store? I\\'m young again. I\\'m young again. Well, I mean, you\\'re not \"young\" young. I\\'m young. You\\'re kind of on the back nine. No, no. No. I\\'m just teeing off, baby. Look at you. You want a friend? You want a friend? I\\'ll be your friend, baby. I\\'ll be your friend. I\\'ll be your... Oh, my God! Yes, my crappy car! You mediocre, middle-class piece of shit! I love you! Pop, Pop. Pop. There he is. There he is. - What\\'s wrong? What happened? - Nothing\\'s wrong. Everything\\'s incredible, Ma. I just wanted to tell you I love you. - I love you. - I love you so much. You gotta tell me how you do the quarter trick, it\\'s driving me crazy. A magician never reveals his secrets. However, if you invite us over for dinner more... You come over tomorrow night, and the night after that. Any time you want. - Stop, I\\'m gonna have a heart attack. - No, I have the heart attacks. Thank you so much for giving birth to me, I know it hurt. Okay? You have no idea. But, honey, please, stay off the bong pipe. I can\\'t promise you that. Okay. I\\'m up. What do you think? If you massage me first. Okay, let\\'s go to sleep. Mom, wake up! There\\'s a crazy noise downstairs. What the heck is going on? Hey, do you mind? I am trying to concentrate. Here I am, staying up all night... ...trying to come up with activities for our Fourth of July camping trip... ...but you won\\'t let me think! You want time to think? Why don\\'t you think about the fact that you just wo... What did you just say? Yes, you heard me. If you keep up this weird attitude... ...I won\\'t be able to work for a year and have to plan 10 more vacations. - That make you happy? - Did you eat a bad Yodel? Give me those big lips. - What\\'s going on down here? - Ben. Ben! Come here. Oh, my God. I missed you, I missed you. Look at you, boy. I\\'m gonna finish the tree house. We\\'re gonna sleep in it next weekend. From now on, we\\'re gonna exercise and I\\'m not gonna wear a Speedo. - All right! - All right. And you. Nice jump! I love you. One day, you are gonna be the hottest chick alive. But you still gotta have brains. So tomorrow I\\'m gonna teach you calculus. You know calculus? I knew you\\'d call me on that. Your mom will teach you. Now, get your rest, because tomorrow we\\'re going camping! I know! It\\'s gonna be the best! - Put a sweater on! Don\\'t take it off! - Okay, Daddy. Oh, and Sundance! Doggie years go by very quick, so it\\'s time to enjoy the real thing. Yeah, go get some, baby. What are you doing? What are you doing? No. Go to Sundance, not the duck. They told me at the pet store it was a female. They lied to me, I guess. - You staying downstairs tonight? - Why? That\\'s getting you going? It\\'s Fourth of July, I\\'m gonna celebrate with my wife. Take my time, massage her, make sure she is fully satisfied. But you know, it isn\\'t the Fourth of July, it\\'s only the second. That\\'s even better. Happy second of July, honey. - Think I like this holiday. - Yeah? I\\'m gonna go change into my Pocahontas costume. - I\\'ll see you upstairs. - I\\'ll bring the duck. Okay, I gotta call my dad and tell him to get the old tent ready. \"Like I said, \\'Good guys need a break.\\' I know you\\'ll do the right thing this time. Love, Morty. P. S: Your wife\\'s rocking body still drives me crazy.\" Okay, Morty. Hey, who wants to have a pillow fight?'\n",

      " '[Olaf Andersen] Uh, ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, please. Your attention. I think you all know our guests of honor today. Our great congressman, Jeff Johnson, and Vera Johnson, his lovely and gracious wife. Many of you know that Jeff is now completely recovered from a triple bypass operation. Doesn\\'t he look great? I never felt better. Before I turn the floor over to the congressman, I\\'d like to thank my old friends, Mr. And Mrs. Zeke Bridges, for the use of their wonderful, lovely home. [Andersen] Thank you, Zeke. Now, sirs, ladies and gentlemen, - In the 20 years of the great... - Som-bitch! Uh... well, seems like a host\\'s work is never done. - [Laughing] - Now, in the 20 years... that the Honorable Jefferson Davis Johnson has been our representative in Congress... Excuse me. Pardon me. What do you say, Pete? - [Andersen] Whatever our walk of life: - Excuse me. - Utilities, pharmaceuticals... - Pardon me. Hi, Malcolm. One bourbon sour straight up with extra orange, and one gibson, no onion, and two white wine spritzers and a Lowenbrau. [Jamaican Accent] Allow me to light your cigarette for you. Hold this for me, sir. The way your hair matches your eyes, I don\\'t know how I can control myself. Excuse me, I\\'ll get those drinks. I can\\'t believe that you\\'re Inga. You don\\'t look Swedish. You\\'re so different from your picture. [Swedish Accent] That wasn\\'t me on the TV, but that sure was me on the telephone. [Normal Voice] You want me to prove it, Zeke? You told me that you want me to tie you up and beat you with... My God, Inga, that was on the phone. I never thought you\\'d be in my house. You\\'ve got to get outta here. [Swedish Accent] But you told me you wanted me! You told me to quit my job. [Normal Voice] And now, honey, here I am. - Not now, waiter. Please! - Don\\'t worry about a thing. I\\'ll handle this. You! Bag on the floor, hands in the air. Do it! Sergeant Brown, vice squad, undercover operations. - I know who you are, dirty pig! - Shut up! You\\'re under arrest. - My God, what\\'s goin\\' on here? - Sir, you\\'ve been the target of a ruthless gang of con artists. It all started when you called the \"Girls of Many Nations\" party line. It\\'s 1-900-phone-sex? You put it on your credit card instead of your phone bill... \\'cause you didn\\'t want your wife to see it, right? Big mistake. The gang used your credit card number to find out everything they could about you. It\\'s the gang\\'s M.O. to wait until the victim\\'s having a big party... and will do anything, pay big money, to avoid embarrassment. Embarrassment? Som-bitch! This goes beyond embarrassment! A hundred of my very best friends paid a thousand dollars apiece... to have a drink with Congressman Johnson. Not to mention the fact my wife is probably looking for me right now. That is exactly what their evil scheme is depending on. In fact, any second now, a huge Latino man\\'s... - Gonna burst in pretending he\\'s an outraged husband. - Inga! - What\\'re you doin\\' with my wife? - Senor... - [Bridges] It\\'s okay, Alice. - My friend, rum and coke. Don\\'t let anyone else in, please. Thanks. - [Armando] Did he touch you? - I got your rum and coke. There\\'s your rum and coke, and she can drink it with you! - [Speaking Spanish, Indistinct] - Hey, i callate la boca. I callate la boca ahora! I ahora asi! Now you see how they were gonna plan to con you outta your money. But I know better, \\'cause I know you\\'re a courageous citizen. - And I know you\\'re gonna testify. Yes, you\\'re gonna testify. - Oh! - I can\\'t testify. - Sure you can. All you\\'ve done was phone sex. - A lot of people have done that. - He wanted me to tie him up... and spank him with a wet garter belt. - [Chuckling] No, no, not me. No, no. - [Thomas] Excuse me. That is between the fantasy hostess and the freak. I don\\'t even wanna hear it. - \"Freak\"? - Hey, poppy. I got a tape in the car. Eight-track or cassette. You wanna hear it? - No, no! No, no! Thank you very much. - Sir, please. They\\'re trying to intimidate you by telling you that they have an audio tape of you freaking on... Did you think you were gonna intimidate him? You\\'re not intimidating him. He\\'s going to testify, because his family may not know he\\'s a freak, but he\\'s been married 20, 30 years. His wife knows he\\'s a freak. \"Freak\"? Uh, Sergeant Brown, I have to talk to you in private, please. Mr. Bridges, I can\\'t leave the suspects by themselves. Well, let\\'s, uh, lock \\'em in the crapper. Okay, come on. Move in the bathroom. - Come on, man, move it. Come on! - [Speaking Spanish, Indistinct] Hey, hey! Vamonos, muchachos, goddamn it! Now you\\'ve all met my legislative assistant, Kimberly. Kimberly and my fine staff, along with myself, will be available to you 24 hours a day. I\\'m proud to be your man in Washington. I plan to keep goin\\' back as long as you keep sendin\\' me. [Cheering] Please listen, Sergeant. - I\\'m the chairman of a large, conservative insurance company. - I know that. I know your chief, Sergeant Brown. Help me and you\\'ll be Lieutenant Brown. Just get these people the hell outta here quietly. Mr. Bridges, I know these people. Okay? If you let them go, they\\'re just gonna blackmail you. I don\\'t care. What do they want? - Goin\\' by their other victims, it costs like $5,000. - Okay. That\\'s 5,000 each, you know. Okay. You know there\\'s four people in the gang. - Twenty thousand dollars? - See, that\\'s what I\\'m tellin\\' you. - I think you should testify. - No, I can\\'t. - Please put your money away, sir. - Look, it\\'s... It\\'s just that I don\\'t have that much cash. I\\'ve only got $12,000. - And there\\'s four people in the gang. - Wait a minute. - My rolex. - Oh, Mr. Bridges, no. No, no, no. Please, sir. No, it\\'s worth $10,000. Oh, Mr. Bridges, I don\\'t wanna take your watch, I don\\'t wanna take your money. - Besides, they don\\'t want a watch. They want cash. - Take the damn money! Take the watch, please! Get them outta here and get that tape. You know this goes against my every principle. Darlin\\', don\\'t you look wonderful. Glad to see ya. Nice to... Hey, how\\'s that knee, huh? - [Speaking Spanish, Indistinct] - Hey, hey, hey, hey! [Spanish, Indistinct] Inga will miss you! Bye-bye. What are you doin\\'? I gotta go get the tape. I don\\'t want you to give them the money until I get the tape in my hand. Come with me. Chief! By golly, am I glad to see you. I\\'m sorry I\\'m late. I had an emergency. You know Sergeant... [Bridges] Where\\'d he go? Sergeant Brown, the vice squad. We don\\'t have a vice squad. You don\\'t have a... Som-bitch! Oh, waiter, where\\'s my bourbon sour? Oh, you must think I\\'m Kareem. I\\'m Jamal. He stiff you on your drinks too? He fired. Kareem! Wait right there. Kareem, where\\'s this woman\\'s drink? This woman\\'s thirsty! - [Man] I\\'ve always enjoyed the time we\\'ve spent together. - [Woman] Oh, thank you. [Man] Why don\\'t we sit down over here? [Guests Laughing] Olaf, I\\'m thinking of retiring from Congress. You can\\'t retire. You just promised all these people you\\'re gonna run again. That was a political promise. You know better than to believe that. [Andersen] Zeke, come here. Listen to this. Have you all seen a waiter come through here? No, I haven\\'t, but, Zeke, I need your help. Hey! - What\\'s got into Zeke? - Damned if I know. Listen, Jeff, you know you got the best job in the world, don\\'t you? You get to go hunting, fishing, skiing and golfing. The best resorts. Then you get to call it, \"official business,\" huh? And, Jeff, you know there\\'s no aphrodisiac like power. Are you tired of having the most beautiful and intelligent women in this country? Ah, the joy\\'s gone out of Congress, Olaf. No, that perks thing was the last straw. And who needs the aggravation? Life\\'s too short. Yeah, well, look, Jeff. You can\\'t retire. If I retire this year, I get to keep $1.3 million... that\\'s left in my campaign fund. It\\'s called \"the grandfather loophole.\" All right, Jeff. I got it. Come here. There\\'s this small software company that\\'s about to go through the roof. Now, what you do, you buy a few thousand dollars worth of stock options. It\\'s gonna bring in a half a million dollars easy. That\\'s just for openers. Huh? If you put it like that, I suppose I... have a duty to continue my career in public service. \"Duty\"! [Chuckles] You\\'re something else, Jeff. I am definitely in the wrong business. - Som-bitch! - Well? - Som-bitch! - Yes! - [Laughing Together] - [Swedish Accent] I love it! [Grunting, Groaning] - [Woman Sighing] - [Johnson] Ohh! Oh, Kimberly! [Kimberly] Oh, Congressman! [Johnson] Oh, Kimberly, you\\'re so good! Yeah! Oh! Oh God! Oh, Oh! Oh, I got a cramp! I got a cramp. It\\'s okay, don\\'t stop. Don\\'t stop! Oh! Yeah, yeah! Oh, God, yes, yes! - Kimberly! Yeah! - Oh, Congressman! - Oh, now, now! Yeah! Oh! Oh, my God! - Oh, Congressman! Oh, my God! Oh, my... [Gagging] [Kimberly Panting] [Panting] Oh, my God! ## [Funeral Organ] [Dick Dodge] It was my honor... to serve with Jeff Johnson in Congress for a generation. No one was a better legislator, a better husband. We\\'re gonna miss him. But we are grateful that his passing was peaceful. The consummate public servant, working late into the night at his desk. - Thank you. - [Dodge] Vera? - Let me talk to you for a minute in here. - Excuse me. Uh, now... I know that, uh, you\\'re still in shock over Jeff\\'s passing, - But we need to talk about his seat. - We do? I would like for you to announce that you\\'re gonna run for Congress. With your name, you can\\'t lose. Mrs. Jeff Johnson would win in a walk. Dick, I\\'ve been a Washington wife for 20 years. I think that\\'s enough bullshit for one lifetime. I\\'d help. I\\'d be running the office night and day. I\\'m sure you would, dear. But I couldn\\'t give you... the same kind of job satisfaction Jeff gave you. Uh-huh. How did I end up with a thief for a grandson? Hey! Aha! Hey, thieves steal. I con, all right? It\\'s different. I\\'m an artist. I\\'m a con artist. - Hey, look! There\\'s the new ad. - Hey. [Loretta As Inga] I am Inga. I am here from Sweden. And I\\'m so lonely. I need a man, and so do my girlfriends. Maria, my hot-blooded Spanish friend. - Babette, zee Parisian pussycat... - [Meows] - And many others. - I hope you sprain your lips from doin\\' this. - I hope your lip muscles freeze up. - We take all major credit cards. [Loretta As Inga] So call the Girls of Many Nations at... [Swedish Accent] What do you think of my accent, Grandma? - Very, very good. Hey, hey. - [Telephone Ringing] Thank you for calling \"Girls of Many Nations\" party line. For hot-blooded Italian wildcats, press one now. For perky American cheerleaders, press two now. For a busty Swedish love goddess, press three now. - [Single Tone] - Another customer for Inga. Don\\'t you dare talk to that man! [Swedish Accent] Hello, this is Inga. Oh, hello, Paul. How are you? Oh! [Giggles] Tell me, Paul, do you have Mastercard? If you don\\'t hang up that phone, I will flush it down the toilet! Uh, no, Paul. Call me later, please. What\\'s the matter with you? This is my business. You are not only a con man, you get your cousin Loretta... - To help you by talkin\\' dirty? Shame on you! - Granny! You mad \\'cause you can\\'t show my picture around the pool no more, Grandma? Of course not. Look what these arthritic hands have been doin\\'. - Oh... - Don\\'t \"oh.\" What are you \"oh-ing\"? Thomas Jefferson Johnson. Why you keep usin\\' my middle name? It sound like a tap dancer or somethin\\'. Make me proud of you, Thomas. Make me proud of the name you carry. I\\'m Ned Grable, Vice President and General Manager of WFL. We think Mrs. Jeff Johnson did the right thing... in not running for the congressional seat left vacant by her husband\\'s death. Jeff Johnson\\'s name may still be magic, but it\\'ll take more than the magic of name recognition... to solve our region\\'s problems. I\\'m Ned Grable. Name recognition. Lordy, what a notion. People would have to be some kind of boobs... just to vote for somebody because their name was Johnson. I remember once back in Georgia. They even elected a dead man. His name was still on the ballot and... folks were just used to voting for him. [Loretta] Okay. Bye-bye. My friends, I wanna tell y\\'all about a town... where the streets are paved with gold. I\\'m talkin\\' about a town where the marks will take you to dinner after you fuck \\'em. I\\'m talkin\\' about a place that, when they run outta money, they just print some more. In this town, a cat bounced 900 checks, didn\\'t even have to go to jail. - You mean \"Las Begas.\" - No, not \"Las Begas.\" No, honey, he\\'s talkin\\' about Washington, D.C. l... You all ready for this? I am running for Congress. - What is this, a joke? - What\\'s the con, T? Yeah, I don\\'t get it, man. - Yo, man, Van Dyke. - Yeah. - You remember Willie Sutton? - My hero. What did Willie Sutton say when they asked him how come he robbed banks? - That\\'s where the money is. - Exactly. Washington, D.C. That\\'s where the money is. Listen, I have been doin\\' some research. I\\'ve been to the library. - [Laughing] - Why you laughing? Congressmen, when they get elected, they get $130,000 a year. That\\'s their base salary. But then they have these things called \"PACs.\" Okay, political action committees, right? Then there\\'s these lobbyists. The lobbyists\\' whole point in life is to buy you off. They buy you off and it\\'s totally legal. It\\'s the con of a lifetime, and I know we can do this shit. Who \"we,\" white man? Us! We! Us! If I get elected, I gotta have a staff. I\\'m gonna get a staff allowance. It says here that new Congress... - You get a staff allowance of $537,000. - [Armando] Ooh! - Damn! - Senor! I get that kinda cash, I\\'m splitting it up with my homies and my homette. How exactly are you gonna get your butt to Congress? Yeah, T. Why the hell would anybody vote for you? It\\'s not like they\\'re voting for me. They\\'re voting for name recognition. The congressman here was Jeff Johnson. My middle name is Jefferson, last name is Johnson. Cut off the Thomas, shorten the Jefferson, Jeff John... nobody knows that their congressman is dead. Who knows that Jeff is dead? He\\'s a congressman. Who cares? If I get on the ballot as Jeff Johnson, nobody\\'s gonna know. Well, how you gonna get on the ballot? That\\'s where you all come into play. My friends, I need, uh, [Chuckling]... I need, uh, 5,625 signatures. - [Laughing] - I knew this \"we\" shit had a catch. Hey, man, you all got a better plan? I do. Who are these \"Silver Foxes\"? Old people who just like to vote? It\\'s a political party. The big thing is, they got their own line on the ballot. They already got the signatures. - May I help you? - Uh, good afternoon. - We have an appointment to see Hattie Rifkin. - Right. You wanna talk politics? Talk. Uh, we was wonderin\\', who you gonna run for Congress this year? Ah, the usual sacrificial lamb. Probably Sylvia Roland. She just lost her husband. She needs to meet new people. Why? Miss Rifkin. I\\'d like to run on the Silver Foxes\\' ticket. I believe and care about you and your issues. That\\'s what my son says, but does he call? What makes you think a group of alter kakers... is gonna support a man who hasn\\'t clipped his first nose hair yet? Because I can win. No, no. A Republican can win. A Democrat can win. A Silver Fox can only make a symbolic point. Mrs. Rifkin, if you get me on the Silver Foxes\\' ballot line, - And if you give me the support... - Lf, if. And di bubbeh volt gehat baitzim, volt zi geven a zeyde. But got haste oykh cane naar nit zine. - [Chuckling] - Uh, what\\'s all this? Oh, she just said that if my grandmother had balls, she\\'d be my grandfather. And I told her that God never told nobody to be stupid. Where the hell did you learn to speak Yiddish? [Yiddish Accent] I learned it from Morris Elfbein, da gin king of Miami Beach. He taught me that and he also taught me... you don\\'t always have to have the best cards to win the hand. Maybe not in gin, but in politics, young man, you need money to win. You need a name to win. You need... - I do have a name. - What, you\\'re an athlete? - You\\'re not on MTV, are you? - My name is Johnson. Jeff Johnson. The name you know. Jeff Johnson? Well, that\\'s a name even our Alzheimer\\'s group will remember. I\\'m not quite sure I understand, Professor Franklin. You did your doctoral thesis on my husband? Yes, Mrs. Johnson. Your husband was a very great man. He did so much to help my people. I remember the time he said that welfare is a drug... and you have to kick it like cold turkey. And at the time, I was on welfare and I did just that. It inspired me to get on with my life. Very inspirational. Yes, well, really, I\\'m sure if he were alive... I was actually in the audience one day when he looked out and he said, \"If you people\\'d just get off your dead asses and go look for work, maybe America can be a decent place to live in again.\" That inspired me. My God, it made me move my ass. And I have a poster of that on my wall, and I show it to all my relatives and friends and Negroes. Really, well. It\\'s kind of you to come all the way from... Where was it? The Wilson Pickett State, uh, Teachers\\' College, ma\\'am. But I didn\\'t just come here to pay my respects to your husband. I came here because, because your husband deserves an archive... where students can study his legacy. - So you want his papers. - Not just his papers, ma\\'am. I would like all buttons and posters and bumper stickers... and all the campaign paraphernalia you can spare, ma\\'am. I know you may have a sentimental attachment to a lot of these things and you... - Take \\'em. - Pardon me? Take \\'em all. Do you want the wedding photos too? - Oh, I don\\'t know if I think that\\'s necessary. - That\\'s lucky. So you won\\'t have to go rooting around in the garbage. - Oh. Hmm. - Hmm. You\\'re in pretty good shape for a professor. Do you work out? Uh, why, yes. Do you? Why, yes. Hmm. [Van Dyke] Are you sure you don\\'t wanna come to Washington with us, Homer? No, I got a business to run. - Bye-bye. - [Telephone Ringing] Hello. Who? League of Women Voters. No, Mr. Johnson will not attend the debate. No, I\\'m sorry, Betty. I cannot tie up this line. Thank you. - [Ringing] - Hello? Star-Ledger. No, we\\'re fresh out of photographs of Mr. Johnson. No, you can\\'t. He\\'s just had surgery for a deviated septum. Yeah, thank you. - [Ringing] - Hello? [Swedish Accent] Ja, this is Inga. [Thomas Using \"White\" Accent] Cast your vote for Jeff Johnson. Good old Jeff, the name that you can trust. The name that you know. Jeff Johnson. [Chinese Accent] Why you no vote Jeff Johnson? He the name you know. Go down vote for Jeff. Jeff Johnson, the name you know. [Homeboy Accent] Hey, you, eatin\\' the greens, and you on the corn bread. Put that down and cast your vote for Jeff Johnson, the name you know. You know it\\'s good. Jeff is good, just like them greens. Jeff and greens. When you think greens, think Jeff Johnson. [Yiddish Accent] In this meshugeneh world, you wanna vote for Jeff Johnson. I don\\'t know why I gotta drive through here and tell you this. You should know who to vote for. Put a vote in for Jeff because he\\'s a good person. What, are you crazy? [\"White\" Accent] We\\'re not gonna show you Jeff Johnson waving a flag, and we\\'re not gonna show you Jeff Johnson kissing babies. We\\'re not gonna show you Jeff Johnson doing anything because you already know... what Jeff Johnson can do. Tomorrow, vote Jeff Johnson, the name you know. - That sound white enough? - That was very white. Yeah. That\\'s chilling, actually. Almost scared myself. Fantastic. Tomorrow, vote Jeff Johnson, the name you know. Who do we vote for for Congress? - Don\\'t we always vote for Johnson? - Ah, that\\'s it, Johnson. If you\\'re just joining us, our exit polls project that in Florida, an unknown independent candidate, whose sole asset appears to be his name, may just possibly win a slim victory. [Cheering, Whistling] ## [Calypso Version Of \"Happy Days Are Here Again\"] Is that him? Is that him? Uh, Patricia, I believe that Congressman-Elect Johnson has just arrived. [Armando] Excuse me, please. Coming through. [Homer] We need to get through, please. - Come on. Come on. - Coming through. Thank you. [Man] Congratulations! [Cheering] [Thomas] Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Hey! [Whistling] Hey, thank you! Thank you so much! People, we ran a positive campaign. We campaigned on the issue. The issue is change. Change for the future. The people have spoken! Ask not what your country can do for you. You have nothing to fear but fear itself. If you can\\'t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen. Live free or die. And in conclusion, read my lips. [Cheering] Mira, mira, mira. The promised land. [P.A. Announcer] Continental flight 228 to Chicago... Congressman Johnson. Congressman Johnson, Arthur Reinhardt. You don\\'t remember me. - I was Congressman Johnson\\'s administrative assistant. - Yes. I Fed Ex\\'ed all that material to you down in Florida. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. Well, you know. You look just like I thought you would look. You see his little wing-tip shoes on? Oh, l... Thank you. Congressman, I hope you don\\'t think I\\'m outta line for meeting you here. I just thought you might need help with logistics, settling in at your hotel. Since you didn\\'t make it to the Harvard seminar for freshmen congressmen, I took the liberty of putting together a set of their papers for you. Thank you for your initiative, but I gotta admit to you, I\\'ve never been much of a student. But you can brief my staff on that, you know. Uh, staff, what hotel are we staying at? - You book the hotel? - No. Talk to him. - You book the hotel? - What hotel? Nobody told me about no damn hotel. Uh, is, uh, staff... obviously failed to nail some vital details, so... Oh, geez, the world bank\\'s in town. Where we gonna find you a room? Hey, I kick your ass. You have to be firm with the staff sometimes. [P.A. Announcer] Continental flight 228 to Chicago O\\'Hare is now... I got lucky at the Hay-Adams. - There was a coup in Uruguay. -  Que? - What? - Uruguay. Anyway, their delegation just checked out. You\\'re a wizard, Reinhardt, and I knew we could count on you. Let\\'s go. - Hey, you got that? - Yes, sir. [Loretta] Careful with that bag. Don\\'t throw it in there like that. I paid too much for that bag. - Say, Congressman? - Yo. I\\'d like to ask you something. I would appreciate it if you would consider me to be your A.A. Oh, that\\'s very nice of you. That\\'s a very decent gesture. But yo, man, listen. I\\'m a social drinker. I don\\'t really hit the bottle very much. Yeah, yeah. No, no. Uh, administrative assistant. - Oh! - As you know, I used to work for Congressman Johnson. And I would like to work for you, Congressman Johnson. So it would be sorta like an affirmative action sorta thing. [Chuckles] Only kidding. I got your resume. I\\'ll call you, okay? - I\\'ll look forward to hearing from you? - Look forward to talking to you. [Giddy Chuckle] Ooh, baby! [Secretary] Congressman Corman\\'s office. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. [Chuckling] [Elevator Bell Rings] - Members only. - Oh, we\\'re going up to Congressman Johnson\\'s office. I hate to be the one to tell you, but Congressman Johnson died. I\\'m the new congressman. I\\'m Congressman Johnson and this is my staff. I\\'m sorry, Congressman. I didn\\'t see your pin. In fact, I still don\\'t see your pin. - What pin? - Your member-of-Congress pin. - I\\'m gonna have to look you up. - I\\'m in the book under Johnson. Thomas Johnson. - Congressman. - [Giggling] Thomas Jefferson Johnson. - Yeah, I\\'m the man. - No picture available. Oh, wait a second. I have my driver\\'s license with me. Got a picture in late. Here it... If I can get it out. - Driver\\'s license. - Oh. See? Same cat. How could I ever have doubted you? Where to? We\\'re going up to 518. Well, the elevator only goes to four. You\\'ll have to take the stairs from there. Are you gonna be grabbin\\' my ass like old Congressman Johnson? Oh, no. I would never grab your ass. Well, you said that awful fast. What\\'s wrong with my ass? Oh, there\\'s nothing wrong with your ass. I\\'m just, you know, I\\'m just, what, I\\'m, I\\'m the new congressman, and I won\\'t be doin\\' none of those things he did. I ain\\'t gonna grab nobody\\'s old ass. I mean, I ain\\'t gonna grab nobody\\'s ass. You know? Hey, I think we on the fourth floor. I\\'ll grab it. [Elevator Bell Ringing] Stairs are to the right. Enjoy. Later, baby. Wait here a second. Good morning, Congressman. What is this shit-hole? Look at this place. What is this? Oh, um... you missed the freshman lottery for offices. They assign them by draw. You didn\\'t show for the draw, so you got the worst office in Congress. What lottery? I missed a lottery? It was all in those briefing books I mailed you. What else have we missed here? Are you hiring me, Congressman? - It\\'s a shakedown. - Excuse me? Oh, ho-ho-ho! You\\'re shaking me down, aren\\'t you? Okay, I\\'m gonna love this town. Okay, I\\'ve been here five minutes and you\\'re already shaking me down. All right, you\\'re hired. Listen, fill me in on everything \\'cause I don\\'t wanna miss the good shit. ## [Classical] [Indistinct Chatter] - Let\\'s go meet the natives. - Yeah. [Thomas] Can you be a little more elegant than that? Shakin\\' your ass and shit. Hey, how ya doin\\'? Thomas Johnson. Rafe Simon, freshman from Tulsa. And this is... - Bo Chandler from, uh... - Lufkin, Texas. Great party. You\\'re Jeff Johnson, the guy from Florida. Yeah, that\\'s me. You know, the rest of us were out there on the campaign trail, raising money, kissing ass, making speeches, dragging our butts from place to place. And he slides in on pure name recognition. Let me tell you something, Jeff. Fuckin\\' brilliant! I thought I was gonna have to kick somebody\\'s... Okay. Hey, no, I\\'m sorry. Thanks a lot. And don\\'t call me Jeff. Jeff is my working name. My name is Thomas, and this is my cousin, Miss Loretta. How do you do? How do you do? [Laughing] What were you guys before you got elected? Lawyers or something? Oh, hey, no. I did morning weather and traffic for KTOK in Tulsa. - Oh. [Laughing] - [Chandler] You don\\'t remember me? Tight end for the Oilers? My knee gimped out on me? Oh, yes! Oh, hey, man. I was wonderin\\' what happened to you. - Why don\\'t you stop by my reception? - Yeah, but don\\'t go... to his reception before you go to my reception. I\\'m gonna be offended if you don\\'t come by my reception. - Okay. - [Thomas] Okay. I guess you\\'re gonna have to have a reception. Yes, I guess we\\'ll have to have something. Shit, I don\\'t know nothin\\' about no reception. You know what I love about this town? The way everybody call you a member. Every time I hear that, it make me think about Mister Happy. - [Laughing] - Hey, hey! Watch them sprinklets, man! He\\'s laughin\\' and piss shootin\\' everyplace. I got a sprinkler too now. Back at ya! - Ow! - All right, then. - Mike Hoyt, lowa. - Thomas Johnson, Florida. So how\\'d you wind up in D.C., lowa? You do the crop report on TV or somethin\\'? No, actually, I owe it all to the Vietnamese. Oh, you\\'re a war hero. P.O.W. When I got back to Cedar Rapids, I spent so many years telling the Rotary Club what was wrong in Washington... they finally told me to either put up or shut up. Ha! So I put up, and here I am. What are you talkin\\' about? What\\'s wrong with Washington? Washington\\'s great! Oh, come on. We got acid rain killing fish and nobody\\'s stopping it. There\\'s topsoil being washed away. No erosion programs. - Why, there\\'s chemicals in the livestock that... - We might have some luck. My God, I sound like a boy scout. [Laughing] No, actually, that\\'s nice. This town could use a few geeks like you. - Hi. - Pete Slocum, Asbestos Information Institute. How are ya, Pete? Nice to meet ya. Ken Korngold, National Distilled Spirits Association. - Very good to meet you, Ken. - Nice to meet you. - Paul Zeckhauser, American Tobacco Council. [Coughing] - How are you, Paul? I hope you can all come to my reception. You know Miss Loretta from my office. - Hi. Hello. - Terry Corrigan. Soon as I saw how you got elected, I knew you were a real comer. Hell, I bet Olaf Andersen voted for you. I don\\'t know. Who\\'s Olaf Andersen? Won\\'t tell him you asked. Fella on the left up there. Chairman, Gulf Coast Power. Constituent of yours, client of mine. Pays the rent, know what I mean? Say, could I host a \"welcome to Washington\" fund-raiser for you, down at my law firm on K Street? - Absolutely. - At $500 a head, you could pick up 20, 25 grand to help you get started. [Nervous Laugh] And how much of that are you gonna get? It doesn\\'t come off the top. Down the road, I\\'ll bill each of them 500 an hour whenever I take you to lunch. You know, Terry, you and I are gonna be so close. I wanna welcome the new members to Washington. We haven\\'t had a freshman class this big in a long time. [Laughing] Well, Congress needs your new blood, and you in turn are gonna need new friends. That\\'s why, tonight, we unite the two great pillars of our system. Political and financial. Now, you know, Congress has taken many hits of late. But, Congressmen, look around you. The people you see here tonight are the ones that have stood behind us. And they are the ones that will be invaluable to you in your next campaign, which I might remind you is less than two years away. Now this is our system of checks and balances at its very finest. Dick Dodge, from your home state. Gonna run for speaker. Raises more money than any other member. But, of course, he\\'s on the right committee, - Which makes all the difference. - Yeah, of course. But I\\'m not telling you anything you don\\'t already know. No, he\\'s on the right committee, so I guess that makes all the difference. Not just on the committee. He\\'s chairman of it. The big boys have to line up to take numbers... to throw money his way. - Your friends can always call on you. - No shit. [Woman] Thank you very much. [Dodge] Oh, uh, Mr. Johnson? You know, it\\'s customary for the new members... to pay a visit on us old fogies in the leadership, especially from your home state. Well, I would have, but I just got in town. I\\'m sorry, man. You know, you can make up for it by having a nightcap with me. - Oh, absolutely. - Can I have my car take you home? Uh, excuse me, Mr. Chairman, but you ain\\'t about to start no homo shit, are you? \\'Cause I ain\\'t with it. - Oh? - Hey. No! But that\\'s good thinking, Thomas. I\\'m impressed by your instincts. I didn\\'t wanna have to whup your ass. - [Laughing] - You know what I mean? Tell me, Mr. Johnson, why\\'d you come to Washington? Well, of course, it\\'s an opportunity to do something for my country, and... Now let\\'s just cut the bullshit. I saw how you got elected. Now flukes like you are either nut cases or troublemakers. I just wanna know which one I\\'ve got on my hands. Why did you run for Congress? - No bullshit? - No bullshit. We got this whole topsoil problem... and, uh, acid rain is killing cattle. - [Pounding At Door] - What? Yes? What? What? - What? - [Thomas] Einhardt! Wake up! [Pounding Continues] What is the name of that committee Dick Dodge is chairman of? - Congressman, this is a surprise. - Come on, man, spit it out. - What\\'s the name of the committee? - Uh... Uh... Come on, come on, come on. What is it? Uh... oh. Power and Industry. - Is something wrong with the hotel? - No. Tell me about this Power and Industry. I heard it\\'s really good. - This is a good thing, right? - Yes, they call it \"the honey pot.\" Each member is constantly being lobbied by every cash-rich trade group in town. Oh, it\\'s 2:40 a.m. Did you realize that? Ah, man, forget that! We\\'re public servants. Time ain\\'t supposed to mean nothin\\' to us, right? - How do I get on this committee? - Um, that would be seniority. Uh, after six terms in office, uh, say, 12 years of service, your name moves along the list and before you know it, you\\'re off the Fisheries committee and on to Power and Industry. - Can this wait? I\\'m much more coherent in the morning. - No, you\\'re doin\\' fine. But I need to know how I can get on this committee, like, immediately. Okay, okay. All right, all right. Uh, immediately. Immediately. - Within, say, your next four years? - No, no, no, no. Immediately, like in my first four days. Now you\\'re a smart guy. That\\'s why I hired you. You might be standin\\' here in these fire engine boxer shorts, but I have faith in you. I\\'m countin\\' on you. - Talk to me, Reinhardt. - Yes, thank you. I don\\'t think it\\'s possible, sir. It would be unprecedented for a freshman congressman... to be put onto that committee. Unless... Well, only in the most remote, hypo... hypothetical situation. Yes? - This is ridiculous, right? - For instance? Well, if the, uh, President of the United States... were to do you a personal favor. Or, uh, some enormously powerful special interest group. Chairman Dodge, please. Will you tell him that it\\'s Mr. Joshua Benjamin from the NAACP on the line? No, ma\\'am, actually, you\\'ll be of a great deal of help. I have a few minor questions. I would like to know... how many members of the chairman\\'s committee are African-Americans. None. Well, I\\'m sure you have a Latino member on the committee. No Latinos either. Does the chairman have any Asians or any Native Americans on the committee? No Asians and no natives. Does the chairman have any handicaps or gays on the committee? No gays. Well, you\\'ve been of a great deal of help. Just forget I even called. Just tell him I said hi. Okay, um, Armando, Van Dyke, you guys are up next. I\\'ll go hit \\'em with the Urban League right away. Fine. And I\\'ll be the conference of Southern Baptist Bishops. [Chuckling] What do you want me to do? Oh, hi. We haven\\'t met yet. I\\'m Loretta Hicks. Congressman Johnson\\'s office? Oh, hi. I\\'m Kimberly Meadows. I work for Chairman Dodge. Power and Industry. How\\'d you get that job? I used to serve under the other Congressman Johnson, so I had the right experience. Well, I hope you haven\\'t been bothered by the pickets. What pickets? Oh. Did, did I let the cat out of the bag? - Are we gonna be picketed? - Look, you\\'ve got to promise... not to say where you heard this from. - Not even my congressman knows. - I promise. Okay. My boyfriend works at the Rainbow Coalition, and he said... [Telephone Ringing] [Telephone Ringing] Congressman Johnson\\'s office. Chairman Dodge? Yes. Okay. That was Dodge. He wants to see you pronto. So we still haven\\'t lost our touch. Asi. He should be back in a moment, Congressman Johnson. [Thomas] Oh! They\\'re here now. - We haven\\'t met. Eli Hawkins. - How ya doin\\'? Brother Eli. Yeah. All right. - All right. Thomas Johnson. - Yes, I know. The Florida upset. Now that you\\'re here, what are you gonna do with it? You gonna feather your own nest, or are you gonna make something of your office? Hey, I\\'m gonna be as good a congressmen as anybody else up here, all right? Exactly what does that mean? Well, uh, ever since I got back from, from \\'Nam... I personally wanna do something about the rain forests. Well, do me a favor. Don\\'t tell me. I\\'ve just had my lunch. Eli, you\\'re gonna have to excuse us. Thomas and I are late for a meeting. Come on in. What\\'s his problem? Uh, Mr. Chairman, I have been meaning to ask your advice about something. I\\'m always available to a young man from my state. Great. It\\'s about committee assignments. Now that\\'s interesting. That\\'s just the thing I had in mind. Go ahead. For the last two days, I have been getting approached... by a bunch of chairmen from different committees. I\\'ve been approached by the people from Foreign Affairs. I\\'ve been approached by the people from Ways and Means and Armed Services. They all want me on their committees and I don\\'t know why. - I\\'ll be damned! - You can understand my dilemma, \\'cause it\\'s like, with Foreign Affairs, you get to fly off to Paris whenever you want. With Armed Services, they got bases all over the globe. Son, are you familiar with my committee? Power and Industry? Oh, yeah. But, uh, it\\'s not as well known as these other committees. Well, maybe not, but you\\'ve been very frank with me. I\\'m gonna be extremely frank with you. These other committees, they\\'re nickel-and-dime stuff. Power and Industry, think of what we cover. Energy, transportation, insurance, the environment. Hell, son, there\\'s no better committee on the Hill. That is, if you\\'re interested in fund-raising. I am, very much. It\\'s just that these other chairmen made pretty strong cases. These other chairmen aren\\'t from your home state. Hmm. They\\'re not offering to take you under their wing. - Look out for your future. - And you are? Hell yes, I am. Oh, well, I\\'m very flattered, Mr. Chairman. Dick. - Well, I\\'m very flattered, Mr. Dick. - No, no, no, no. - Oh, I\\'m sorry, Chairman Dick. - No, Dick. Just Dick. - Oh, Dick. Just plain old Dick. - Yeah. Fine. I know you don\\'t get something for nothing. What do you want from me, Dick? [Chuckles] Well, son, I want an able lieutenant. And I want you to smile for the cameras. Skeeter, you know Thomas Johnson, the new member of the committee? Thomas, this is Barclay Warburton. - How are you, Barclay? - Skeeter, please. - Been called that since boarding school. - Oh, sorry, man. - Cheers. - Yeah, cheers. Skeeter. Thomas, please. Been called that since reform school. This EPA oversight hearing of the committee on Power and Industry will come to order. I would like to welcome our first witness, the distinguished administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. But before I do, I would like to note that we have a new member joining us today. The distinguished gentleman from Florida. [Photographer] Congressman Johnson? Sir, can we get a shot, please? - Thank you. - How am I doing? Great. Great. Well, Mike, enjoy those hors d\\'oeuvres. [Indistinct Chatter] Hi. My name is Miss Loretta, and I\\'d like it... very much if you\\'d sign one of these little name tags. That would be just nice. It\\'s an informal breakfast. You give us your point of view, we give you, uh, bacon and eggs plus a $2,000 honorarium. For your favorite charity, of course. The Thomas Jefferson Johnson Foundation. Oh, okay. An honorarium. I like the way that sounds. [Man] Excuse me. Nice to see you. [Thomas] Excuse me a second. - Hi. - Hello. - How are you? Very nice to meet you, Miss Celia Kirby. - Good, thank you. It\\'s a extremely beautiful name for an extremely beautiful woman. Well, my, that was very smooth. You know, after about ten hours straight on my feet, making small talk, breathing in that cheap cigar smoke, that is exactly the kind of line I\\'m ready to fall for. - [Chuckling] Slow down, okay? - Sure. Tell me, which one of these guys is Congressman Johnson? - You\\'re looking for the congressman? - Yes. How would you feel if I told you I was the congressman? Aha! - Oh, duh! - I\\'m so sorry. Would you give me two seconds to take my foot out of my mouth, please? Take all the time you need. Can we start over again? Yes, Celia Kirby, Legislative Director of Pro Bono. Celia kirby from Pro Bono! Very nice to meet you. - Yes. - Would you tell me something? Are all the pro bonettes as fine as you? Pro Bono is a public interest research and advocacy group. I\\'d be delighted to brief you on our priorities this session. Do you think, perhaps, I could call your A.A. and be put on your schedule? - Call my A.A.? - Yes. No, you don\\'t have to call my A.A. Why don\\'t we do this? Why don\\'t we, say now, go out to dinner? You can brief me at dinner. I\\'d like an appointment, Congressman, not a date. We could write it up as an appointment, but we\\'ll have, like, flowers and dinner, a mandolin, and it\\'ll be a \"floral\" appointment. It was a pleasure to meet you, Congressman. I will be in touch with your staff. There\\'s one other thing. I\\'m particularly interested... in hearing your view on extending the sexual harassment law to include congressmen. Oh. I get it. Can we turn the A.C. down, please? Thank you. Uh, I have a confession to make. I don\\'t know very much about poultry. But I do know people, and I like you people. I really do. And if you people come to me and you say to me... that you have something to say important about poultry, I\\'m gonna listen. Thank you very much. Thank you for seeing us. We won\\'t take up much of your time. - This is Ira Schecter, our research director. - Hi, Ira, how are you? This is Mr. Reinhardt. You remember him? Come sit next to me and have this chitchat. I\\'ve been dying to talk to you about these issues. Sit, everybody, sit. Come on. - All right. - We can take as long as we want. Congressman, you do have several people waiting. - No, no, they can wait. - They can wait. What are you doing standing, Ira? Sit down, Ira! Uh, sure. Well... [Clears Throat] These are issue papers. - Ah. - This session we\\'re targeting child safety, auto insurance premiums and food additives. Certainly, as the votes come up, you\\'ll be hearing plenty from the other side. We simply would like a fair shot at making our case too. - Absolutely. - Absolutely. Okay, now, let\\'s talk about car insurance. What are you paying, Ira? - Me? Oh. - [Thomas] Yes. Uh, well, I have an \\'82 Dodge Dart and, uh, I pay about $650 a year, or so. Six hundred fifty dollars? Man, that\\'s highway robbery. A chop shop wouldn\\'t give you more than 230 on a junker like that. Or so I\\'ve heard. Hey, look, I\\'m flying blind here. What we need to do is for you to put together a little package. Put a package together for me and we\\'ll sit down. We\\'ll block aside two Saturday evenings and we can discuss it then. Well, I don\\'t see any problem with arranging that. Once again, you\\'ve been more than generous with your time, Congressman. What are you doin\\'? I clear my whole calendar and you\\'re in and outta here in five minutes? Look, sit down. We haven\\'t discussed child safety yet. Ira, sit. I\\'m gonna slap you. Sit. Come on, down. Sit down! Let\\'s finish talking. Let\\'s talk about child safety now. This is an important issue. Child safety. Well, we are sponsoring a bill imposing safety standards on imported toys. Great. I hate imported toys. Hate \\'em. I wish they didn\\'t exist. Especially those little baseball men... with the springs in their neck that do this. What is that? Fuck that, right? - Fuck that. - [Thomas] Yeah, I hate that. Why don\\'t we do this? Like I said, put the package together. We\\'ll block aside a couple of Saturday evenings and we can discuss it... - And you can take me through all the ins and outs. - \"Ins and outs\"? I\\'d like to do more money for you, but first I\\'ve got to get your positions on a few issues. Now where are you on sugar price supports? - Sugar price supports. - Hmm? - Where should I be, Terry? - Shit, it makes no difference to me. If you\\'re for \\'em, I got money for you from my sugar producers in Louisiana and Hawaii. If you\\'re against \\'em, I got money for you from the candy manufacturers. - You pick. - Let\\'s say... for. Yeah, for. For. How about putting limits on malpractice awards? Oh, you tell me. If you\\'re for \\'em, I got money from the doctors and insurance companies. If you\\'re against \\'em, I got money from the trial lawyers. - Let\\'s put you down as against. - Yeah, you know what? Put me down for against. How about pizza? Oh, no, this salad is gonna be enough for me. Not for lunch, old buddy. For PAC money. You thought I was serious? I was fuckin\\' with you. - Well, you are. You are! - Fuckin\\' with you. Uh, duh! Terry, tell me something. With all this money comin\\' in from both sides, how could anything possibly ever get done? It doesn\\'t. That\\'s the genius of the system. [Thomas, Terry Laugh] Hey, baby, put down nuclear power for ten G\\'s. Mambo! [Loretta] Cool! Yeah, the congressman\\'s gonna be out your way next week. Mr. Willie? Congressman Johnson calling. Can you take his call? Thank you. Please hold. A-one, a-two... Yes, Mr. Brown. Uh-huh, on the 30th. We were wondering whether you aerospace people... might want to lay on a luncheon so that you can hear his views. I\\'m sorry, Mr. Willie. He just picked up another call. I know why he was calling you. He hasn\\'t heard from you about his fund-raiser. A thousand dollars a head? A whole table! Lovely. Yeah. Well, now, what kind of a contribution to his foundation were you folks thinking about? Now, we\\'ll have a little huntin\\' in the morning, little fishin\\' in the afternoon, clean air, beautiful scenery. All to work up a good appetite, \\'cause we got a fine French chef... back at the lodge flown in special. Oh! That\\'s very, very nice. - You don\\'t want anything from us? - We would enjoy the opportunity... to share our views. You see, we feel that the semiautomatic weapon\\'s gotten a bad rap. Now, the gun control nuts try to make out that they\\'re for drug dealers only. But, uh, really, they\\'re just guns for the ordinary sportsman. [Chuckling] Nothin\\' like a nice, warm Uzi. [Duck Call Quacking] [Duck Call Continues] [Quacking] Yee-hee! Must have had a heart attack. Aaah! And according to the 1988 study, it showed eight per 100,000. - Am I losing you on these mortality rates, Congressman? - No, not at all. I was, uh, I was just wondering how much of this is a statutory problem, - And how much of it is a regulatory one. - Mmm, mm-hmm. - Didn\\'t the Merton Act cover most of this? - Excellent point. Excellent point. Let me check something out. Excuse me. You\\'re absolutely right. Maybe we could get them to amend Merton. Oh, get \\'em to amend it. Yes! Get \\'em to amend it, huh? Well, \"For Merton to apply, you have to show high contagion. It sounds to me like your contagion... rates... are no higher than the common clod.\" \"Cold.\" \"Common cold.\" Excuse me a second. Arthur! - Ow! - What were we talking about? How\\'d you wind up hustling for pro bono instead of pesticides anyway? - \\'Cause you could have been a big-time lawyer. - I was for a while. - But it depressed me. - What could be depressing about makin\\' $100,000 a year? - I know you gotta get sick of losin\\' all the time. - Of course I do. Mainly it makes me angry, and the anger keeps me going. Of course I\\'d like to win a few and I\\'m not allergic to money either. - So why are you doin\\' it? - Hey. It\\'s so embarrassing to come right out and say why I do it. - Why? - It\\'s embarrassing for me to say. - I just feel... - Stop! What? Meaning! My life has to mean something. So now I have a question for you. I\\'d like to know how you got named after a memorial. Oh. [Chuckling] My grandmother liked Jefferson. You know, \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" You know, old black folks\\' thing. There\\'s a lot to live up to, so I kinda specialize in one portion of that. That\\'s the pursuit of happiness. - And how\\'s it going? - Um. - Honestly? - Mm-hmm. I was goin\\' real good \\'til I met you. Now, the better I do, the worse I feel. Isn\\'t that strange? Mmm, when can I see you again? Let\\'s go to dinner Saturday night. - How about Sunday morning? - Oh, oh, brunch? The wages of sin is death! And to the man who values gold over goodness, the Lord allows no exemptions. - [Congregation] Amen. - Amen. And to the man who shows no respect... for the privilege of walking this Earth, the Lord allows no deductions. - Amen. - And to the man whose pockets are bulging... and whose soul is empty, the Lord grants no 90-day extension. And when the last trump sounds, believe me, you will be audited. This is a wonderful date. Oh, darling, I\\'m glad you could make it! Oh, I love that sermon, Uncle Eli. This is your uncle? Yes, my niece tells me you\\'re not half as slimy as I thought. That puts you somewhere between a lizard and a toad. Quite a step up, huh? Thank you very much. Forgive me for staring. I don\\'t know how I missed the family resemblance. She\\'s you in a skirt. [TV Announcer]... trailing by 13 as we begin the second half. [Man] Yeah, I guess we\\'re all bringin\\' our wives. Al, you gonna bring your wife, ain\\'t ya? [Al Chuckling] You bet. [TV Continues Indistinct] Uh-huh. Uh. [TV Continues Indistinct] Oh, I slipped. - Ellie. - How ya doin\\', Thomas? I need your help on the ethics bill, Leon. - I want you to cosponsor my amendments. - You make a persuasive case, Eli. But that wasn\\'t a yes. I promise to give it the attention it deserves. - Better luck next time, son. - Yeah, man, you\\'re so good. He\\'s so good. He took $600 off you that last hand, didn\\'t he? - He took a real shinin\\' to me. - If I didn\\'t know any better, I\\'d say you lost to him on purpose. There\\'s nothin\\' wrong with lettin\\' the head of the ethics committee... roll ya every now and then. You know, you\\'re gonna fit in real good around here. Too good. How come you never ask me to help you out with your amendments? Oh, come on, Thomas. Give it a rest. Everybody knows you\\'re Dick Dodge\\'s boy. Hey, man, I ain\\'t nobody\\'s boy, all right? Don\\'t waste your outrage on me. I know what ya are. - I am no different than anybody else up here, okay? - That\\'s not true. You see, some people here actually do something besides saving their own ass. You know, just then you reminded me of my father. Did I really? How so? He used to say I was a scumbag too. [Bell Ringing] Aren\\'t you going to vote? Is that what that means? You know, all this time I\\'ve been listenin\\' to that shit, thinkin\\' it was time for Final Jeopardy or somethin\\'. [Chuckling] [Indistinct Chatter] - [Thomas] Excuse me. - Excuse me, Congressman. - I\\'m Mrs. Koslowski. - Hi, I\\'m leaving. We were just learning how a bill becomes a law. Was that a vote? Yes, that was a vote in there. Oh! Oh! Yes, that was a vote. A vote was made. Bye-bye. - And what did you vote? - Ah, I voted nay. It was a terrible bill and it would have destroyed the fabric of American life. What was the vote on? [Chuckling] Rafe! Rafe, will you talk to these nice people. Explain to them about the vote. Well, it was a motion on the previous question on the rule. No, it was a motion on the recommitment... of the rule of the motion of the previous question. - Which means? - Clean air. School lunches. Ah, you see the difficult choices we have to make here, kids, between clean air and school lunches, okay? That\\'s why I want to be the education congressman. See, \\'cause I feel... that American students should be able to eat lunch and breathe at the same time. And I see an America where there\\'s no such thing... as a student who is below average. And I think it is wrong when students have to stay up late at night... and miss all the good shows doing homework. Then get up early in the mornin\\' and go to school. This sort of thing just is not fair. [Cheering] - Uh, good morning. May I help you? - Yes, I\\'m Ellen Juba. - This is my daughter, Mickey. - Hi. We\\'d like to see our congressman. We live in the district. Just a moment, please. Ah, could you come out? Thank you. Be right with you. I like your hat. How do you do? I\\'m Miss Loretta, public liaison for the congressman. Ellen Juba, my daughter, Mickey. We\\'d like to see him. Y\\'all from the district? Up here seeing the sights? How\\'d you folks like some gallery passes? Go listen to the great debates of our day. We don\\'t wanna go to the gallery. We wanna see Congressman Johnson. Well, how about a house key ring? For each of you? Here, see that? Isn\\'t that something? Turns into a pen. I don\\'t think you understand. We\\'re not tourists. We\\'re constituents. You\\'re not with some organization, are you, honey? I\\'m a goddamn citizen. Isn\\'t that enough? Do you have an appointment? No, I do not have an appointment, because y\\'all keep givin\\' me the runaround. Well, I\\'m sorry, but the congressman is a very busy man. Now, if you\\'d like to discuss it with me, I will personally... go over the issue with him and get a letter out to you. We\\'re not leaving here until we see him. Armando, would you come out front? We have a situation. You stop palming me off on your flunkies. Are you gonna go in there and tell him we\\'re out here... or am I gonna go in there and tell him myself? - Excuse me, may I help you, please? - Yes, you can. - I would like to see my congressman, please. - He\\'s not here today. - I bet he is here. Excuse me. - No, no, please, lady. - No, you just let me by! - No, don\\'t push. Okay. Ya! Ya! - [Indistinct Shouting] - I am sick of this! I am fed up! - I have every right! Let go of her! - Hey! Oh, baby. Come on, Mama. Let\\'s go. Hey. What happened to you? The doctor says they got it all. I\\'m gonna be okay. I was lucky, but, but there are others. - What others? - Other kids. They call it a cancer cluster. At first, none of us in the neighborhood wanted to believe it. But then we all saw it. For me, it was when the two-year-old across the street... developed a brain tumor same as Mickey\\'s. We looked at everything: the water, the air, dump sites. Insects, you name it. And then we realized it was starin\\' us right in the face. - What? - Power lines. High-voltage power lines. The wires cause magnetic fields and the magnetic fields cause cancer, especially in children. I\\'ve never heard anything like that in my life. Why don\\'t you just come see for yourself? [Children Laughing] - This is Mickey\\'s school? - Uh-huh. It turns out a lot of schools are near power lines. Land\\'s cheap, so schools tend to buy it from the power companies. We\\'re nobody, Congressman. You\\'re somebody. - We need your help. - [Sighing] Will you excuse me for a second? Come here. - Is this real? - That depends on who you ask. Some people say it\\'s worse than asbestos or breast implants. Others say it\\'s coincidental. Well, you. What do you say? I think it\\'s very suspicious that the White House would kill an EPA report... saying that power lines probably cause cancer. - They did that? - Yes. [Sighing] Well, I gotta do somethin\\' to help these people. Don\\'t tell me you\\'re actually developing a conscience. Oh, God, I hope not. It\\'d be a fuckin\\' nuisance in Congress. But if I were, what could I do to help them? This goes beyond personal tragedy. It goes to a public health hazard of unknown proportions. It goes to the right of the ordinary people to know all the facts! Yeah, people ought to know if the neighborhoods are killing them. Amen, gentlemen. Amen! And what a fine effort it is. I\\'m totally sympathetic. Congressional hearings should be scheduled just as soon as possible. The American people deserve no less. Message: we care. Turn this way, please. - Right here, sir. Great! - Over here. [Thundering] Cheers. You know, son, you\\'re a real comer. I wouldn\\'t be a bit surprised if you ended up in the leadership. I\\'ll say this, if I were speaker, I\\'d sleep better with you as a lieutenant. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I\\'m surprised to hear you say that. \\'Cause I really honestly didn\\'t think you was gonna go with me on this power lines thing. - But I\\'m not. - But you said you\\'re sympathetic. Well, of course I did. We\\'re all sympathetic to little girls with cancer. But I\\'m not sympathetic to holding a public inquiry. - You just said... - I know what I said. But sound bites aren\\'t sworn testimony. Now look, son, it\\'s great to get your name in the newspaper. Let \\'em know you care. Very smart move, Thomas. But that\\'s as far as I would go with this if I were you. [Intercom Buzzing] Yeah? Oh, fine, fine. No, no, no, send \\'em in. We\\'ve got some unexpected visitors. - Hope you don\\'t mind. - Oh, hell, no. Sure, great. [Laughing] Mr. Chairman! Olaf! - Hello, Terry. - Evenin\\', Mr. Chairman. Thanks for tak... Thomas! They let you in here, you S.O.B.? You folks finally gonna get to press flesh. Olaf! Come and meet Thomas Johnson. Thomas, Olaf Andersen. - Chairman, Gulf Coast Power. - Glad to meet ya, son. They tell me you got a real talent for the game. This is Zeke Bridges, CEO, Superior Mutual Insurance. Som-bitch. - Oh, you two know each other? - Ah, no, we haven\\'t met. But I know a great deal about the man. We share a common interest in international affairs. Swedish in particular. Oh, another Rolex. I collect these. Mine\\'s a slightly older model. Can I have a double bourbon, please? It is very nice finally meeting you, Mr. Bridges. Yes, it\\'s nice to meet you, Congressman. Thomas and I were just talkin\\' about, uh, power lines. Man, I think we oughta have those hearings. Well, now look, Thomas, why don\\'t we get, uh, Olaf\\'s take on this? Well, it\\'s tragic. Cancer\\'s a terrible thing. But there\\'s no way you can link it to power lines. - The truth is... - Wait a minute, there have been studies... Every study that says one thing, I\\'ll show you a study saying another. We\\'ve studied this ourselves. Nada. What if all you guys are wrong? Thomas, do you want us to move the power lines? You know how much it would cost to bury those things in Florida alone? - We\\'re talkin\\' $5 billion. - Not counting the liability claims. How would you like the people in your district to think of you as the fellow... who tripled their electric bill? I just thought that if we had the hearings... Think for a moment, chum. You hold your hearings. Overnight, everyone who lives near a substation... will find the value of his home in the toilet. - You\\'ll kill the real estate market. - You\\'ll kill the insurance companies. - You\\'ll kill the school district. - You\\'ll kill the local economy. [Thundering] Son, system ain\\'t perfect. But the fleas come with the dog. Maybe I should think about it, huh? - Atta boy. - [Clearing Throat] Oh, Thomas, on a completely different subject here. You haven\\'t set up a state PAC yet, have ya? \\'Cause I\\'d be happy to start one off with a contribution of, say, 200,000. No strings attached. Natch. - You were beautiful, Olaf. - No, you were beautiful, Dick. - No, you were beautiful, Terry. - To the mutual aid society. - Hey. - Hi. So? Are the Jubas gonna testify? Hmm? When\\'s the committee holding hearings? Um, actually, I think the, the hearings might be postponed a little bit. What\\'s Dodge pulling now? Nothin\\'. It\\'s actually kinda good, \\'cause now I get to, you know... Get to round up some other members and get my ducks in a row and... [Laughing] - You shafted me on the ethics bill! - Hey, Eli! You just missed a good one. Wait a minute, that reminds me. - Same two old men on a park bench... - It\\'s a closed rule! I can\\'t get my amendments on the floor! I can\\'t get a recorded vote. I can\\'t get squat! This is not the rules committee. This is the steam room. This is the U.S. Congress. The American people deserve better than this! You know what your problem is, Eli? You\\'ve got \"sermonitis.\" [Laughing] Now, why don\\'t you just relax? Have a massage. I\\'ve got news for ya, Dick. I\\'m gonna run against you for speaker. I\\'m gonna make this whole race boil down... to whether we want a sleaze like you in the speaker\\'s chair. I\\'ll bet ya $100 you don\\'t get ten votes. [Sighing] I\\'m gonna be your shadow, Dick. Every member ya strong-arm, every reporter ya background, every talk show ya go on, I\\'ll be there. Five votes! Nobody likes to hear a sermon. I may not have a rat\\'s ass of a chance to beat you, but I sure as hell can let the world know... what you stand for. I went too far with him. I know it. - Now you know him pretty well, don\\'t you? - I wouldn\\'t say I knew him well. Oh, come on, Thomas, you\\'re seein\\' his niece. - Hell, you\\'ve been out to his damn church. - How do you know that? Because I keep my ear to the ground. Now, Thomas, he\\'ll listen to you. I want you to go make the peace between us. Tell him we\\'ll work something out with his amendments. Not a vote, I won\\'t go that far. But at least he\\'ll get to say his peace from the floor. Just get him off of my back. - Another round? - Yeah, why not? To the honorable Dick Dodge. Hey. By the time I\\'m finished with him, he won\\'t be speaker. He\\'ll be lucky if they don\\'t indict him. Eli, people do things that they regret, man. People make mistakes. - Dick\\'s been under a lot of pressure lately. - Come on! Thomas, you\\'re Dick Dodge\\'s yes-man. I am not a yes-man. When Dick says no, I say no. I know what you\\'re up to. He\\'s scared and this is damage control. Yeah, well, you know what? This town... It isn\\'t about passin\\' laws anymore. It isn\\'t about doing good anymore. All it\\'s about... is bein\\' here. [Loretta] Well, as I live and breathe. - Hey, cuz. - Hey. Oh, I\\'m sorry. This is Miss Loretta Hicks from my staff. - This is Congressman Hawkins. - Pleasure to meet you. Oh, would you like a drink? You know, you two look like you could use a designated driver. - Oh, good samaritan. - Praise \\'em. [Dispatcher] Number 22, I got a pickup at the Regency, going to National. You want a girlfriend? [Dispatcher] Eighteen, Union Station. Shit! [Indistinct Yelling] [Indistinct] Oh, shit. Yeah, I need an ambulance right away. [Telephone Beeping] Hello? - It\\'s somebody called Thomas Johnson. - Oh. - What\\'s wrong? - I went out with Hawkins. We got in an accident. He\\'s out cold. I\\'m okay though. - Were you driving? - No, it was Miss Loretta. - The girl from your office? - Yeah. Hey, look, man. I don\\'t like the way this looks for anybody, okay? You said you wanted to get back in Hawkins\\' good graces. This is your opportunity. All right. Now you listen to me very carefully. I want you to tell the ambulance to take you to Walter Reed Hospital. It\\'s a privilege they extend to congressmen. They\\'ll keep it quiet. I\\'ll handle the police and you go home. Keep your mouth shut. [Beeping] - [Ringing] - What? What? What? Hello? Hello? Mr... . Mr... . Mr. Chairman? Um, um, um, no, no, no, no, sir. No, no, I\\'m, I\\'m, I\\'m a night owl. Uh-huh, um... Oh, my God, is, is he all right? G-Good, good, good. Um, and, and Eli and Loretta? Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh. That\\'s brilliant, Mr. Chairman. No, I\\'ll call the morning shows and leak the information. They\\'ll eat it up. At the top of the news, Maryland Congressman Elijah Hawkins... is in satisfactory condition at Walter Reed Hospital... after an overnight accident in the district. That\\'s right, Laura. Hawkins reportedly had alcohol in his blood. Also slightly injured was an unidentified woman whom police say... is linked to a phone-sex operation in Florida. - Shit. - Linda, Congressman Hawkins? That\\'s Reverend Hawkins, isn\\'t it? Right you are, Laura. And how this plays into his longstanding campaign... to reform congressional ethics is now anyone\\'s guess. I\\'m trying to find Reverend Eli Hawkins. [Nurse] Let me check for you. Yes, he\\'s right around the corner there. Stay away from him. Stay away from me too. - Celia, listen, we were set up. - We were set up? You were in the car. I didn\\'t hear your name mentioned on the news. - Somethin\\' stinks here. - It sure does, and guess who it is, Thomas? You don\\'t give a damn about anything, do you? To think the other night I actually thought you cared... - About somebody other than yourself. - You know how I feel about... Not me! You jerk! Mickey Juba. You caved on the power lines, didn\\'t you? Don\\'t even answer because I know you did. What\\'d you get for it? - Are you gonna let me talk? - Get the hell outta here. Get out! [Thomas] Hattie! Hattie Rifkin? - Oh, rifkeleh! - Don\\'t rifkeleh me, you momzer! - What the hell do you want? - Hattie, I wanna talk to you. I\\'ve heard that before, Mr. Name-You-Know. Hattie, I know you got me elected and I forgot your name in the mornin\\'. I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry, but I really, really, really... I really need you. So talk. Why are we meetin\\' here, Thomas? Trouble at the office? Well, Dodge says he keeps his ear to the ground. But I know that\\'s bullshit. He has an inside man. - Reinhardt? - Yes. - Let\\'s whack him. - Hey, this ain\\'t Scarface, all right? You got a plan? Big con. Dick Dodge is the mark. - Dick Dodge? - Aren\\'t we getting out of our league here, man? This guy\\'s been doin\\' the big con for over 30 years. Mmm, cuz, these politicians, these are some serious slick fish. Wait a second. Is everybody goin\\' soft here all of a sudden? Are you all a bunch of fuckin\\' incumbents now? Listen, Thursday, Dick Dodge is at the arts caucus, all right? I need to know how long it takes to get from there to the EPA building. All right, Armando? Okay, now. Loretta, get some information on the EPA and give that to the roper. I got a list of equipment I want you to go get. - Crazy, baby. - Hey. Don\\'t we need a new roper? I mean, hey, look, everybody around here knows our faces. - [Car Horn Honking] - Speak of the devil. - My man! - What up, T? - Homer! - What\\'s up? Hey, Dick. Eli Hawkins got his tail... - Caught in a crack, huh? - He did. - And you kept my name out of it? - I did. - So I owe you? - You do. This hearing of the committee on Power and Industry will come to order. [Dodge] The health of America\\'s insurance industry... Hey, come here. Somethin\\' came up. I got a call from an EPA guy. Said he heard how fast I bailed on the power lines. He\\'s got something really hot for me. He wants to meet me outta the office, after business hours, like tonight. [Thomas] Mr. Whitney? You said you\\'d be alone. What is he doin\\' here? What is he, a cop? You wearin\\' a wire? You wearin\\' a goddamn wire? Relax, Mr. Whitney, I\\'m not wired. Yeah? Well, let\\'s see. I know you got it. I just gotta find it, that\\'s all. - Get your hands off me! - Hey, man, I told ya he\\'s okay. He\\'s not wired. Look. He has no wire here. No wire. You can trust him. Look at this guy. He\\'s got fire engines on his drawers. This is a good man. Now cool it. Just relax. Is this gonna be something we can use? Your friends at the power company would be very interested. - Talk to me. - All right. The White House is putting heat on the EPA. Now we\\'re gonna announce a major investigation... on the relation between power lines and cancer clusters. Mrs. Dodge, it\\'s Arthur Reinhardt. May I please speak to the chairman? [Woman On Intercom] Mr. Andersen? Mr. Bridges is on one. Zeke! How in the hell are ya? [As Zeke] I\\'m madder than a baptist in a brothel, you som-bitch! Olaf! You hear about this EPA bullshit? Why, it could ruin Gulf Coast Power! They\\'re goin\\' ahead with this goddamn power lines investigation. I thought we had this settled. They don\\'t have any proof. They ain\\'t lookin\\' for proof! They\\'re lookin\\' for dinner and we\\'re it! I tell ya, I\\'m about as crazy as a dog in a hubcap factory. [Sighing] Ah, shit. All right, Zeke. Zeke, I\\'m goin\\' up to D.C. for the clean air hearings anyway. I\\'ll talk to Dodge. - Ya got a second? - Yeah. Okay, I heard something. And I know there\\'s some business in it. - I\\'m listening. - EPA, launching a big investigation on power lines. - They\\'re gettin\\' a lot of pressure from the White House. - That\\'s very interesting. I heard the same thing. - Nothing gets by you, does it? - Not much. But thank you, son. I appreciate your sharing that with me. Okay, so, there\\'s probably something in it for us. Thomas, if we got the EPA off Olaf Andersen\\'s back, he\\'d be extremely appreciative. - So... how do we go about doin\\' that? - My committee. We audit their funding. Hell, I got him by the balls. - So you\\'re just gonna rip their balls o... - Oh, no, no, no. Thomas, persuasion. - Strenuous persuasion. - Oh, now, that\\'s allowed. Persuasion, yes. Intimidation, no. But... it\\'s a gray area. - Who\\'s to say which is which? - Oh! Persuasion. You can\\'t rip \\'em out. You have to persuade \\'em out. Hey, Dick, is there somebody you can call to make sure... the EPA\\'s really doing the investigation? - Of course. He oughta be in by now. - Who? Skeeter Warburton, of course. Always go straight to the top, son. Oh, a little outta my league, Dick. Hey. Watch it. Let\\'s go! [Hattie] Congressman Dodge? Oh, uh, uh, Mrs. Rifkin from the, uh... Silver Foxes. You remember, America\\'s second-largest seniors\\' organization... with members in every district in Florida, including yours. Oh, yes, of course. It\\'s a marvelous organization, just marvelous. - Well, it\\'s always a pleasure to see... - I need to talk to you. Yes, I\\'d like that very much, but right now I\\'m in a rush to get back to my office. - You call for an appointment. We\\'ll get together... - This won\\'t take a second. - Could I just walk ya to your office? - Uh, well... - That\\'d be fine. - Oh, good. If the FDA would just agree to look at the new support hose, we\\'d feel like we made some progress. Indeed, you know, Mrs. Rifkin, I\\'m always so excited to hear your views, but really, dear, I\\'ve got to run. So run, who\\'s keeping you? So don\\'t be a stranger. Keep in touch. [Elevator Bell Ringing] [Elevator Bell Ringing] [Coin Clanging] Kimberly, can you get me Skeeter Warburton on the phone, please? Right away, Chairman Dodge. - Uh, sweep for radon? - Radon? I\\'m sorry, l... I don\\'t recall. Do you have a work order? Oh, no, uh, Supervisor said, uh... Supervisor said ain\\'t supposed to be no paperwork on this... \\'cause something about y\\'all killed some radon study. Well, we did delete a few minor budget items. Hey, how\\'s it gonna look to the other people... if they find out I swept your office for radon, didn\\'t do everybody else\\'s? - How that gonna look, Mr. Warburton? - Point taken. Go right ahead. You better step outside. I gotta spray some nasty shit. Look at that. Uh-huh. Ah, Brenda? I\\'m stepping out for a few minutes. Yeah, Brenda, don\\'t come in here, \\'cause you may get some of this shit on ya. [As Warburton] Ah, Brenda, I\\'ve changed my mind. - I\\'m expecting a call from... - Mr. Warburton, Chairman Dodge is on line two. Oh, speak of the devil. Put him through. Afternoon, Mr. Chairman. Skeeter here. I need a straight answer from you, Skeeter. Is the White House on your back about power lines? - Are we off the record, Mr. Chairman? - Of course. I had hoped to go up to Hyannis Port this weekend to spend time with Tish... and do some sailing, but I don\\'t think I\\'m going to be able to because I\\'m... spending a lot of time in the office writing testimony to your committee on cancer clusters. Well, l, uh, appreciate your candor, Skeeter. - Anything to be of help, Mr. Chairman. - Bye. [As Warburton] Ah, take off for the rest of the week, please, Brenda. [Dodge] I don\\'t see how I can help ya on this one. This is the EPA. This is the president. - This is my lifeblood. - Olaf, I see that. I see that. But in this town you\\'ve gotta pick your fights. This could mean six figures, Dick. High six figures. Seven figures? I suppose a million dollars isn\\'t too much to insure against losin\\' five billion. - Now you\\'re talkin\\'. - But how can I funnel this kind of money to you? If that\\'s what you want, we can find a loophole. No one will see your fingerprints. - No one will know? - No one will know. Olaf\\'s just making a contribution as a patriotic citizen. - And in return for that, he\\'s getting... - Good government! Exactly! Little access, that\\'s all. Yes, I\\'m callin\\' from Chairman Dodge\\'s office on the Hill. We wanted to be sure CNN was sending a crew to the clean air hearings today. No, not the new emission standards. We\\'re breaking news. This is the biggest thing since the check bouncing scandal. This is Cynthia Leeson from the White House press office. My boss just wanted me to call you folks and let you know we\\'re going to be making... a very important announcement today at the clean air hearings. No, I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t tell you that, but it\\'s hot. If the New York Times wants to be the only paper in town to miss out... on the biggest story of the year, that\\'s just up to y\\'all. Hurry up, get into your seats. Come on, you guys. [Hattie] It\\'s gonna be a great day. Molly, next to Harry. - Let\\'s sit here. - What, in the back? - Just sit down, will you? - All right. - How\\'s everything? - Great. You know what would be a wonderful way for us to start? With me congratulating you on what a wonderful job you\\'ve been doing on the committee. And really show our appreciation especially on behalf of the minority community. Well, I appreciate that, son. Thank you very much. I\\'m cutting out of here early. [Ira] Don\\'t wanna run into him? This is a mistake. I never should have come. I\\'m surprised, well, delighted by the media turnout today. - I had no idea that clean air was such a good issue. - Oh, yeah, isn\\'t it somethin\\'? This meeting of the Power and Industry Committee... to consider the reauthorization of the clean air act is now in session. Today\\'s first business is a panel of national leaders... in the field of utilities, but before I welcome them, the chair would like to yield to the distinguished gentleman from Florida. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I\\'d like to make a very personal statement, Mr. Chairman. I would like to start off by saying thank you from the bottom of my heart, thank you for your leadership and for your vision. But most of all I\\'d like to thank you for your courage. Especially for your courage. - My courage, huh? - Yes, sir, your courage... in exposing the corruption that eats away at this institution. Your courage in taking on the special interests... and your courage in taking a major new step. But l-I\\'ve done nothing new. Nothing at all. What are you talking about? This is true! Because integrity is nothing new to you, Mr. Chairman. Integrity is second nature to this man. But still it\\'s a rare public servant who\\'ll take on the PACs... and the lobbyists and the fat cats... and side with the American family who just want to live in safe neighborhoods... and send their kids off to safe schools. Well, I thank the gentleman, but we really must move along. If the gentleman would... Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, I had a meeting with the chairman... in his office with Mr. Olaf Andersen... of Gulf Coast Power, and his lobbyist, Mr. Terry Corrigan. I thank the gentleman! But we really must move along! The subject of this meeting... was the possible EPA investigation on power lines... and the connection between them and increased cancer risks. Gentleman\\'s out of order. Now what makes this meeting different... from most of the other meetings that take place in Washington... was that the American people were actually represented... in the form of this. Oh! At Chairman Dodge\\'s suggestion, I videotaped the entire meeting! Huh? Don\\'t ya love that? Isn\\'t that somethin\\'? Dick Dodge! Isn\\'t he somethin\\' special? - Don\\'t you love this man? - [Gavel Pounding] - Gentleman is out of order. - Dodge double-crossed us. - You\\'re fired. - Don\\'t ya love this chairman? [Gavel Pounding] Gentleman is out of order! See, he\\'s brought dignity back to the name Dick. No longer is it tricky. Come on, Dick is good! Dick is good! - Turn off his microphone! - Chairman Dodge! This is neither the time nor the place for these matters. But you may rest assured that the committee... will investigate them thoroughly. Now, we\\'re gonna take a 15-minute recess. Dick, you crazy son of a bitch, you know we planned this. [Crowd Murmuring] You stupid son of a bitch! You taped our conversation? They are makin\\' \\'em kinda small nowadays. You bastard! You two bastards! You think you\\'re gonna hang me out to dry? Bullshit! If I go down, you go down, Dick Dodge! Say, do you remember that little $300,000 you squeezed outta me... for your voter registration scam, huh? What the hell was that? Just water under the bridge. What about the $200,000 for your phony foundation? - Or the bundled checks my executive put in your pocket? - Okay, now. - Olaf. - No, no, I trusted you, Dick. I gave you my condo in Vail. - I gave you my corporate jet to fly all over the... - All right... I bought 10,000 copies of your boring, dull-ass autobiography! I put up scholarships to send your kids through college. I even hired your goddamn color-blind wife to redecorate my office. - Olaf! Jesus! Sit down! - What are you doin\\'? - I\\'m tryin\\' to tell you, I didn\\'t have a goddamn thing to do with this! - You shittin\\' me? No, no, no, no! Think! Think! I know you got me by the short and curlies. What the hell would I have to gain by sellin\\' you out? I had no idea that slime bag was tapin\\' us. Excuse me. Dick? Lighten up on the slime bag, huh? What\\'s your game, Thomas? Shakedown? Yeah, it\\'s a shakedown. All right? And unless you wanna see this... all over CNN, you\\'re gonna pay my price. First, I want you to call Skeeter Warburton. I want you to tell him to launch an investigation on power lines. - Wha... - Ah! There\\'s more. I want you to resign. You can tell people it\\'s for health reasons. Most of us will believe that \\'cause we\\'ve seen you in the steam room. Why the hell are you doin\\' this? I am doing this for Mickey Juba and I\\'m doin\\' this for Celia Kirby and I\\'m doin\\' this... for my grandmother and about a million other people you wouldn\\'t give a shit about. Who? - Do we have a deal or not? - Well, I guess that... depends entirely on what\\'s on that tape, doesn\\'t it? You know what\\'s on this tape. This is America\\'s sleaziest home video. Fuck that. Let\\'s see what you really got on that tape. - This is just a copy! - Give me that! Yo, man, it\\'s just a copy. [Loretta As Inga] Maria, my hot-blooded Spanish friend. Babette, zee Parisian pussycat, and many others. - So call the Girls of Many Nations. - It\\'s a bluff. - At 1-900-555... - It\\'s a stinking, cheap-ass bluff. [TV] NATO. But the question is, can we get the shit back into the horse? Why not? He never made any specific charges. So what do we do when we go back in the hearing? Leave that to me. You just walk back in there lookin\\' dignified. - Dignified. - And you! You better be very, very quiet in there, my friend. I got the goods on you, and it would be my pleasure to leave tire marks all over you. - Oh, like you did Hawkins? - Oh, not even close. So unless you wanna spend the next 20 years in prison, you keep your mouth shut. Now, do we understand each other here? Yeah, we understand each other. Huh? All right, let\\'s do it. [Man] All right, folks, step back, please. Come on. Clear the hallway now. Give \\'em some room. [Indistinct Shouting] Chairman Dodge! Get that thing outta my face! What is on that tape? [Indistinct Shouting] - Come on, let\\'s go in there! - Go! By the way, Dick, I didn\\'t mean that about your wife. I think she\\'s great. Thank you, Kimberly. These hearings are now reconvened. - Without going into details, - No problem, no problem. I would like to make a comment on the... unfortunate incident that we all just witnessed. Now, this body... Well, indeed our whole... system of government is imperfect. It\\'s imperfect because it depends on people. Human beings who make mistakes, act in haste, misinterpret things... Yeah, and do things like buy 10,000 copies of your autobiography. Which by the way is not a crime, unless you make people read it. - Damn it, sir, you are out of order. - [Crowd Laughing] Hey, hey, hey! Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey! To hell with order. The truth is gonna come out here today, all right? All right! You want the truth? Here\\'s the truth, Congressman. The man you see before you is nothing but a common criminal. He got into this House through fraud! Now! You want more truth, Congressman? Here\\'s your rap sheet. Arrest for bookmaking, cardsharping, con games, mail fraud. You know, I had hoped to avoid damaging this noble institution. But I can see that you have no respect for this institution or for anything else. There! I dare you to respond. [Crowd Murmuring] Yeah, this is me. Can\\'t deny it. Can\\'t deny anything on here. I did all of this. Except for this thing. This woman got her shoes back. This woman here. But everything else on this list is real. I did it, don\\'t deny it. But all of this is nothing... compared to the shit I pulled off right here in Washington. And everything I did in this town would be considered legit. Now that is enough! Have you no shame, Mr. Johnson? Do you deny that just five minutes ago you attempted to impugn the integrity... - Of this committee... - [Andersen On TV] You son-of-a-bitch! - You taped our conversation! - From a highly-respected... You two bastards! You think you can hang me out to dry? [Andersen On TV] Bullshit! If I go down, you go down, Dick Dodge! Hey, you remember that $300,000 you squeezed outta me... for that phony voter registration scam, huh? What about the $200,000 for that phony foundation, huh? Or those bundle of checks my executive put in your pocket. - Olaf! Look! - I trusted you! I trusted you! I gave you my condo in Vail. I let you fly my corporate jet. No, I even bought 10,000 copies of your boring, dull-ass autobiography. - Olaf! Sit down! I\\'m tryin\\' to tell ya somethin\\'. - What? What? I didn\\'t have a goddamn thing to do with this! - Bullshit! - Olaf! Think! - Order! Order! - You... Clear the room! Clear the goddamn room! I want order! I will have order! Come on, let\\'s hear it for ex-chairman Dodge! - Come on! Put your hands together! - Yes! Let\\'s hear it for the retiring chairman! You can do much better than that! This man is going to jail. Give him a big round of applause! Come on! [Man] Go write a new book! - Hey! Hey! - Thomas! Thomas! What the hell are you doing? We\\'re all gonna go to jail! You son of a bitch! Look what you did to your man. Look what you did! Hey! Hey! Hey! Yeah, you almost got your ass whipped just then. [Shouting] Hold him really tight, hold him. I want to get some good pictures while he\\'s got color in his cheeks. Huh! Now, smile for the cameras, Dick. How am I doin\\', huh? - That\\'s it. - Thank you. - Smile, please. [Cameras Clicking] So how does it feel being a national hero? Terrible. Everybody knows my face now. I\\'m finished in the line of business I was in. Can\\'t exactly go into 7-Eleven and pass bad checks anymore, you know. - So what are you gonna do? - Well, I got a full head of hair. - Uh-huh. - A famous face and pretty good bullshit. - There\\'s only one thing I can do. - Congress is gonna throw you out. Yeah, but I\\'m gonna run for president. [Giddy Chuckle]'\n",

I got up took a shower and got ready and then I met up with Jamie and Whitney and Lindsay.. We went ridin for a lil bit then we took Jamie's car over to her house and went to Justin's. We went swimmin at night time. It was fun fun... Then I had to get out and take Whitney home...She had to be home early b/c she didnt come in on time the other night...lol!! Then Jamie and I called and said she was 'stayin the night with me' and I said I was 'staying the night with her' and then we well kinda went and met up with Justin and them and went up to Section to the little house. We didn't really do anything but hang out and stuff.. I didn't sleep all freakin night and then we left there about 9:30 this morning and took Lindsay home and Jamie and I came to my house and we laid on my bed and passed the fuck out. We were gonna get up at 12 and like wash the hoopty doopty van and do stuff... but like we kinda slept til like 2 and then finally got up. We went and bought me something at the dollar store. Then we  came and washed the van and then I took a shower and I took Jamie and got her car. I then went to work. FUNFUN....but the best part is..

      " 'Easy. Saw some turkeys on the way here. Crossed right in front of me like I wasn\\'t even there. How rude of them. That\\'s what happens when you spend six days a week working in the mines. Stupid birds start to think they own these woods. When\\'s the tour leave? Couple hours. Well, let\\'s go. Hey! - Hey. You\\'re okay. - Let go! You\\'re okay. You\\'re safe. It\\'s okay. You\\'re here with me. You\\'re with me. Okay, okay. I\\'m sorry. We should... We should go. Are you coming to the train station? I think you have enough people saying goodbye without me there. Only a few I actually care about. It might be easier if I didn\\'t. It\\'s only a few weeks. I\\'ll be back before the snow melts. A lot can happen in a few weeks. Are we gonna do this again? Gale, it was an act. Yeah, it was a good one. I did what I had to do to survive. If I didn\\'t, I\\'d be dead. I had to do that. At least once. Haymitch! Haymitch! Haymitch, wake up. It\\'s Tour Day. Haymitch. What are you doing? Cameras are gonna be here in an hour. If you wanted to be babied, you should\\'ve asked Peeta. Asked me what? Asked you to wake me without giving me pneumonia. You are a strangely dislikeable person. But you do have your virtues. Would you like some bread, Katniss? No, I ate at the Hob, but thank you. You\\'re welcome. You two have a lot of warming up to do before show time. Which is in an hour, so take a bath, Haymitch. I just did. Did you have a good walk, dear? - Walk? I was just out - We have visitors. Miss Everdeen. This way, please. Such bravery. Such spirit. Such... Contempt. President Snow. What an honor. My dear, I think we can make this so much simpler if we agree not to lie to each other. What do you think? Yes, I think that would save time. Sit down, please. I have a problem, Miss Everdeen. A problem that began the moment you revealed those poison berries in the arena. If that Head Gamemaker, Seneca Crane, had had any brains at all, he would have blown you to bits then and there. But here you are. I expect you can guess where he is. Yes, I think so. After that fiasco, there was nothing left to do but to let you play out your little scenario. And you were very good. That whole love-crazed, besotted schoolgirl routine. Impressive. Truly. You convinced the people in The Capitol. Unfortunately, not everyone in the districts fell for it. I mean, you can\\'t know this, but in several of them, people viewed your little trick with the berries as an act of defiance. Not as an act of love. And if a girl from District 12 of all places can defy The Capitol and walk away unharmed, what is to prevent them from doing the same? What is to prevent, say, an uprising? That can lead to revolution. And then, in a fraction of time, the whole system collapses. It must be a fragile system, if it can be brought down by just a few berries. Yes, it is, indeed. But not in the way you imagine it. How should I imagine? You should imagine thousands upon thousands of your people dead. This town of yours reduced to ashes. Imagine it gone. Made radioactive. Buried under dirt as if it had never existed, like District 13. You fought very hard in The Games, Miss Everdeen. But they were games. Would you like to be in a real war? No. Good. Neither would I. Did your mother make these? Peeta. He\\'s a lovely boy. Tell me. At what point did he realize the depth of your indifference towards him? I\\'m not indifferent. Don\\'t lie! You promised. Why don\\'t you just kill me now? I don\\'t want to kill you. I want us to be friends. But if not friends, then allies. What do I need to do? When you and Peeta are on tour, you need to smile. You need to be grateful. But, above all, you need to be madly, prepared-to-end-it-all in love. - You think you can manage that? - Yes. Yes, what? - I\\'ll convince them. - No. Convince me. For you, Miss Everdeen. Do convince me. For the sake of your loved ones. Stop. Take it all in. This is sacred ground. History was made here. You\\'ll get used to the smell. Hello! There she is. My greatest triumph! Our little superstar. Sweetie, we\\'ve missed you. What a cute little house. So quaint, isn\\'t it? Of course, you\\'ve heard about Cinna? What happened to Cinna? Oh, dear, he\\'s a fashion star. You\\'re his muse. Everyone in The Capitol\\'s wearing him. Everyone. - Everyone. - Well, not everyone. Cinna! Katniss? Katniss, is this your sister? Oh, sweetie! Are you okay? Just adorable! - Yeah. - Ready to work? - Yeah. - All right. Good. Welcome! Last year, the 74th Hunger Games brought us the greatest love story of our time. Two brave young people, against all odds, chose to die rather than to lose each other. As a nation, we shared their agony. But we had so little time to revel in their joy. It\\'s time! She\\'s done, she\\'s lovely. We must feed the monster. All right now. Let\\'s go to District 12 and find our star-crossed lovers! You\\'re excited. You\\'re in love. Big smiles for the camera in three, two, one. There she is! Katniss Everdeen! The Girl on Fire. And there he is! Peeta Mellark! The Baker\\'s Boy. Trouble in paradise. I hope they\\'re all right. Anyone at home? Should we come back later? Sorry, Caesar. Please. It\\'s all right. It\\'s your day. It\\'s your day. So how\\'s it going? We\\'re good. That\\'s it? That\\'s all we get? \"We\\'re good”? So taciturn all of a sudden. Peeta, give me some details! Yeah, things are great here in 12. Thanks to the generosity of The Capitol, we\\'ve never been closer. Twenty-five yards, to be exact. Fantastic! We\\'ll be checking in with both of you throughout the Victory Tour. Thank you so much, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark! Wonderful! Everybody in motion. We are out of here in 10. - That was nice acting. - You, too. Almost thought that kiss was real. Come along, children, we are on a schedule. The train awaits! Fabulous food, fabulous wine, the massages, spa treatments. I told them nothing but the best for my two Victors. It all needs to be... Fabulous? Exactly. Now, the schedule is a bit of a bear. 12 days, 12 districts. But it\\'s mostly parties, celebrations, adoring fans to greet you at every stop along the way, and then we wrap it up in The Capitol. All you need to do is give a few speeches, wave to the crowds, and enjoy your time in the spotlight. You\\'ve earned it. What did you say? Katniss. I said, \"Enjoy it, Katniss, you\\'ve earned it.\" By killing people- Young lady... I\\'m really not in the mood for a lecture. I\\'ll apologize to Effie later. I thought you were Haymitch. You don\\'t have to apologize to anybody. Including me. I know it\\'s not fair of me to hold you to things you said in The Games. You saved us. I know that. But I can\\'t go on acting for the cameras, and then just ignoring each other in real life. So if you can stop looking at me like I\\'m wounded, then I can quit acting like it. And then maybe we have a shot at being friends. I\\'ve never been very good at friends. For starters, it does help when you know the person. I hardly know anything about you except that you\\'re stubborn and good with a bow. That about sums me up. No, there\\'s more than that, you just don\\'t want to tell me. It\\'s like I said, I\\'m... See, Katniss, the way the whole friend thing works is you have to tell each other the deep stuff. - The deep stuff? - Yeah. Like what? Like... What\\'s your favorite color? Well, now you\\'ve stepped over the line. Seriously, though, what is it? Green. What\\'s yours? Orange. - Like Effie\\'s hair? - No. Not that orange. More like a sunset kind of orange. Did you see that? What? Well, I never. This is not very festive. The mayor will make some introductory remarks. And then you just have to say a few words. It\\'s customary, of course, to give a brief eulogy to the district\\'s fallen Tributes. For 11, that\\'s Thresh and Rue. Here are the speeches. I can do the talking if you want. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the Victors of the 74th Hunger Games. Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark! Smile, smile, smile, smile. Stand up straight. You\\'re on camera. Thank you. We\\'re honored to be here with you today. And to be with the families of your fallen Tributes. He put down the cards. - Though they fought and lived with honor... - Why do I bother? ...and dignity until the end, both Thresh and Rue were so young. But our lives aren\\'t just measured in years. They\\'re measured in the lives of people we touch around us. For myself, for Katniss, we know that without Rue and without Thresh, we wouldn\\'t be standing here today. So in recognition of that, knowing that it in no way can make up for your loss, we\\'d like to donate one month of our winnings to the families of the Tributes, every year, for the rest of our lives. Shit. Can he do that? He can\\'t. But he did. Why doesn\\'t he just stick to the cards? Thank you. I just wanted to say that I didn\\'t know Thresh. I only spoke to him once. He could have killed me, but instead he showed me mercy. That\\'s a debt I\\'ll never be able to repay. I did know Rue. She wasn\\'t just my ally, she was my friend. I see her in the flowers that grow in the meadow by my house. I hear her in a Mockingjay song. I see her in my sister Prim. She was too young, too gentle. And I couldn\\'t save her. I\\'m sorry. No! No! Wait! Wait! No! Leave him alone! Leave him alone! No! Let me go! Please leave him alone! No! No! No! You! No, no, no! Come here! Stop it! Stop it! Stop! What did I do? Come on. Shut up. In all my years, I\\'ve never seen... You two have a very simple task. I never meant for anyone to get killed. He has to know that. What are you talking about? Who has to know what? Snow. He came to see me. He\\'s worried about rebellion in the districts. He thinks that they don\\'t believe our love story. So he wants you to make them believe it? - To calm things down. - You know, Katniss, you shoulda told me that before I went out there, and tried to give these people the money. I\\'m sorry. I didn\\'t know what to do. He threatened to kill my family. Well, I have family, too. Okay? People that I need to protect. What about them? Who protects them? Katniss, what were you thinking? I was thinking about Rue. Haymitch, please... Please, just help me get through this trip. Please, just help us get through this. This trip? Girl, wake up. This trip doesn\\'t end when you get back home. You never get off this train. You two are mentors now. That means that every year, they\\'re gonna drag you out, and broadcast the details of your romance. Every year, your private life becomes theirs. From now on, your job is to be a distraction. So people forget what the real problems are. - So what do we do? - You\\'re gonna smile. You\\'re gonna read the cards that Effie gives you. And you\\'re gonna live happily ever after. Think you can do that? Yeah? Come here. You\\'re gonna be okay. I promise. Katniss and I want to share with you our victory. And our gratitude to The Capitol for bringing us together. It was the bond of love, forged in the crucible of The Games that was our greatest prize. For it is love and true love that allows us all to bear our hardships. That mends the heart and banishes loneliness and gives meaning to our lives. We also want to share with you the sorrows of your losses. The Tributes of this... The Tributes of this district were brave and noble warriors. They brought honor to their families and pride to their people. We are all of us united, both victors and vanquished, in serving a common purpose. Thank you. One day, I\\'m gonna volunteer. Just like you did. It was just a dream. I\\'m sorry. It\\'s okay. I get \\'em, too. Goodnight. Peeta. Will you stay with me? Yeah. Always. We are all of us united, both victors and vanquished, in serving a common purpose. - The power and glory of The Capitol. - Put down the cards! Tell us what you really think! Panem today. Panem tomorrow. Panem forever. Your hair looks lovely, darling. When did you start wearing it like that? Everyone at school wears it like this now, Grandpa. Snow is watching us. If he wants you to pacify the districts, I promise you, he\\'s not happy. Instead of being in love, you two sound like you\\'re reciting from a drilling manual. You try reading that stuff that Effie writes us. Tell that to President Snow when you see him two days from now. I\\'m open to suggestions. We could get married. That\\'s not helping. I\\'m serious. If, like you said, we\\'re on this train forever, it\\'s gonna happen eventually. Why not now? It does make a statement. I\\'ll give you that. Yeah, sure. Let\\'s do it. Just when you thought things couldn\\'t get more exciting going into a very special Quarter Quell, our two lethal lovers, my favorite expression, from District 12 have surprised us with a new twist in their love affair. Let\\'s take a look. A fairy tale ending for two star-crossed lovers. That\\'s beautiful. Beautiful. And then tonight, the tour that began in the hollows of District 12 will end where? The Presidential Palace. The party of the year. Eyes bright. Chins up. Smiles on. I\\'m talking to you, Katniss. Now, there\\'ll be photographers. Interviews. Everyone will be here to celebrate you. My Victors. Breathe it all in, children. This is all for you. It\\'s cozy. Attitude. Come, come. Come along. Excuse us, excuse us. Come, come. Hold hands. And the library. All mahogany. Hello, hello! Not yet, not yet. No, no, no. Curtains! Everybody who\\'s anybody is here. And they all want to meet you. Flavius! Octavia! Try one of these. They are divine. No, I can\\'t eat another thing. - Here. - What\\'s this? It\\'s for when you\\'re full. It makes you sick. So you can go on eating. How else could you taste everything? I think it\\'s time for a dance. Katniss? People are starving in 12. Here, they\\'re just throwing it up to stuff more in. Katniss? Peeta. This is Plutarch Heavensbee. Head Gamemaker. Successor to Seneca Crane. That\\'s a tough act to follow. Peeta! May I? Please. So how do you like the party? It\\'s a little overwhelming. It\\'s appalling- Still, if you abandon your moral judgment, it can be fun. So are you having fun? I\\'m the Head Gamemaker. Fun is my job. Thought that was what happened to Seneca Crane. Too much fun. Seneca decided to quit breathing. Decided. It was that or poison berries. Being Head Gamemaker has never been the most secure job in the world. Then why are you here? Same reason as you. I volunteered. Why? Ambition. The chance to make The Games mean something. The Games don\\'t mean anything. They only mean to scare us. Well, maybe it was you who inspired me to come back. The Presidential welcome. I\\'m sure we\\'ll meet again. Katniss, come. The President awaits. You think we convinced him? I\\'m not sure what else we can do. Tonight, on this, the last day of their tour, I want to welcome our two Victors. Two young people who embody our ideals of strength and valor. And I, personally, want to congratulate them on the announcement of their engagement. Your love has inspired us. And I know it will go on inspiring us every day for as long as you may live. Look at them. She\\'s not who they think she is. She\\'s not a leader. She just wants to save her own skin. It\\'s as simple as that. I think that\\'s true. But she\\'s become a beacon of hope for the rebellion. And she has to be eliminated. I agree she should die. But in the right way. At the right time. It\\'s moves and countermoves. That\\'s all we gotta look at. Katniss Everdeen is a symbol. Their Mockingjay. They think she\\'s one of them. We need to show that she\\'s one of us. We don\\'t need to destroy her. Just the image. Then we let the people do the rest. What do you propose? Shut down the black markets. Take away what little they have. Then double the amount of floggings and executions. Put them on TV. Broadcast them live. Sow fear. More fear. It won\\'t work. Fear does not work as long as they have hope. And Katniss Everdeen is giving them hope. She\\'s engaged. Make everything about that. What kind of dress is she gonna wear? Floggings. What\\'s the cake gonna look like? Executions. Who\\'s gonna be there? Fear. Blanket coverage. Shove it in their faces. Show them that she is one of us now. They\\'re gonna hate her so much they might just kill her for you. Brilliant. When did you... We need to talk. Where are we gonna run away? Into the woods. Like we always talked about. If we leave right now, we can be far away from here by tonight. Yeah, who\\'s \"we\"? You, me and your fiancé? It\\'s not just me and Peeta any more. Snow threatened to have you killed. Anyone else? Well, he didn\\'t exactly give me a copy of the list but a good guess, it includes both of our families. Unless what? You and Peeta get married? Unless nothing now. Gale, we can do it. You said yourself that we could do it the morning of the Reaping. What do you say now? Do you love me? Gale, you know how I feel about you. But I can\\'t think about anyone that way right now. The only thing that I can think about every day, every waking moment since the Reaping, is how afraid I am. There\\'s no room for anything else. But maybe, if we got away from here, if we went somewhere safe, it could be different. I could be different. You think maybe the President\\'s bluffing? He\\'s not bluffing. Not with what\\'s going on in the districts. What do you mean? What did you see? There were people fighting in the streets, and fires, and Peacekeepers were gunning them down, but the people were... What? The people were what? They were fighting back. It\\'s happening- It\\'s finally happening. I should\\'ve just eaten the berries in the arena and died like I was supposed to. Then everything would be back to normal and everyone would be safe. Safe for what? To starve? Work like slaves? Send their kids to the Reaping? You haven\\'t hurt people, Katniss. You\\'ve given them an opportunity. They just have to be brave enough to take it. There\\'s already talk in the mines. People wanna fight. We have to go, Gale, before they kill us. They Will kill us. What about the other families? The ones who stay. What happens to them? - People are looking to you, Katniss. - I don\\'t want anyone looking to me. I can\\'t help them. You do what you want. I\\'m staying here. Commander Thread, welcome to District 12. Let\\'s get to work. - Let\\'s go! Keep moving! - Stay close! Find and clear. Burn all contraband. Let me go! Ripper! My eye! I\\'m gonna get you out of here. No! Leave her be! Stop! No! In the square. Here. Yeah, hold that on there. No! No! No! Stop! Katniss! It\\'s okay. Just go. It\\'s okay. Move. You want another? Go ahead. - Get out of my way! - No, you don\\'t want to shoot her. How about I shoot both of you? Look, Commander, you\\'re new here. Trust me, I\\'m trying to help you. I\\'m Haymitch. You recognize her? Katniss Everdeen. Darling of The Capitol. She interfered with a Peacekeeper. I never said she was smart. Look, you already got a couple of lashes in, right? That\\'s not good enough. She\\'s an agitator. - Easy, easy. - Look... You\\'re sure Snow wants three dead Victors here? Because that\\'s what we\\'re looking at. It\\'s bad enough that you marked up her face on the eve of the big wedding. Let it go. And we will, too. All right. Okay. But next time, it\\'s the firing squad. Excellent idea. I don\\'t care who she is. Clear the square! You\\'re all under curfew. Anyone out after dark will be shot on sight. Get \\'em outta here. It\\'s Gale. Get him here. Here we go. Really easy. Up, UP- Okay. Okay. Thanks. New Head Peacekeeper. Not entirely peaceful. Missed your eye. Doesn\\'t need stitches. - Make a snow coat. - Peeta, get the snow. I\\'ll grind the herbs. What is that? That\\'s hurting him. He needs morphling. It\\'s okay. Mom. No. I\\'ll do it. Oh, God. Hold him, please. That\\'s better. - Hey, Catnip. - Hey. Thought you\\'d be gone by now. I\\'m not going anywhere. I\\'m gonna stay right here. Cause all kinds of trouble. Me, too. Hey. You wanna get some rest? I can look after him for a while. I\\'m gonna go get him more snow. Hey. How\\'s your eye? It\\'s not my eye that\\'s bothering me. How can we live like this? How can anybody live like this? It\\'s not living, but... Since the last Games, something is different. I can see it. What can you see? Hope. You understand that whatever I do comes back to you and Mom. I don\\'t want you to get hurt. You don\\'t have to protect me. Or Mom. We\\'re with you. I love you. I love you, too. The broadcast cut out here. Before any of the excitement happened. - How many people saw it? - Hard to say. There was a five second delay, but it happened fast. If you cannot contain Katniss Everdeen, then I will have to terminate her. I understand that. And not just her. Her entire species has to be eliminated. Her species, sir? The other Victors. Now, because of her, they all pose a threat. Because of her, they all think they\\'re invincible. Whatever game you think you\\'re playing, those out there are not playing it with you. There\\'s a way we can still win. It\\'s what we Gamemakers like to call \"a wrinkle.\" Ladies and gentlemen, this is the 75th year of The Hunger Games. And it was written in the charter of The Games that every 25 years, there would be a Quarter Quell to keep fresh for each new generation the memory of those who died in the uprising against The Capitol. Each Quarter Quell is distinguished by Games of a special significance. And now on this the 75th anniversary of our defeat of the rebellion, we celebrate the 3rd Quarter Quell as a reminder that even the strongest cannot overcome the power of The Capitol. On this, the 3rd Quarter Quell Games, the male and female Tributes are to be reaped from the existing pool of Victors in each district. No! Who does he mean? Victors shall present themselves on Reaping Day -regardless of age... - Katniss... ...state of health or situation No. Peeta. There she is. Finally did the math? And you\\'ve come to, what? Ask me to... Die? I\\'m here to drink. Finally, something I can help you with. What\\'s it say that Peeta was here 45 minutes ago begging to save your life and you only just now show up? It means we have to save him. You could live 100 lifetimes and never deserve that boy. Come on, Haymitch. Nobody decent ever wins The Games. Nobody ever wins The Games. Period. There are survivors. There\\'s no winners. Peeta has to survive. We have to do whatever it takes to save him. All right, if... If they call his name, I\\'ll volunteer in his place. Haymitch, thank you. But they call my name and Peeta volunteers, there\\'s nothing I can do. You can help him in the arena. Like you did for me. I think these Games are gonna be different. I don\\'t care. Do whatever you can. Peeta lives. Not me. Promise me. Okay. We should\\'ve gone when you said. Welcome. Welcome. As we celebrate the 75th anniversary and 3rd Quarter Quell of The Hunger Games. As always, ladies first. The female Tribute from District 12, Katniss Everdeen. Wonderful. And now for the men. The male Tribute from District 12. Haymitch Abernathy. - I volunteer as Tribute. - I can\\'t let you do that. You can\\'t stop me. - Peeta. - Let go. Very well. The Tributes from District 12. Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark. Well, all that remains is... Oh, no. But, but, but... Katniss! - I get to say goodbye. - Katniss! - New plan. Straight to the train. - No, I have to say goodbye. Katniss! No. Good bye! All right. Before we begin, I\\'ve had a thought. You don\\'t say? Katniss has her gold Mockingjay pin. I have my hair. I\\'m going to get you two boys something gold. Why is that? A token. Show them we are a team. And they can\\'t just... Thank you. All right. Now... Everything will be different, because it\\'s a Quarter Quell. The Capitol has spared no expense. A new training center. New Tribute living quarters. And of course, a very special arena. But this year you\\'ll be facing other Victors. Capitol favorites. Smart, cunning, skilled. And they all know one another. You two are the outsiders. I want you guys to forget everything you think you know about The Games. Last year was child\\'s play. This year, you\\'re dealing with all experienced killers. All right. What does that mean for us? That means you\\'re gonna have to have some allies. - Okay. I think that if... - You\\'re not the problem. No. Look, you\\'re starting at a disadvantage. Most of these people have been friends for years. That just puts us higher on their kill list. Do it your own way, but I know these people. You go it alone, their first move is gonna be to hunt you down. Both of you. Katniss, come on. How could any of us even trust each other? It\\'s not about trust. It\\'s about staying alive. Cashmere and Gloss. Brother and sister. District 1. They won back-to-back Games. Capitol favorites. Lots of sponsors. They will be lethal. And the other half of the Career Pack, Brutus and Enobaria. What\\'s with her teeth? She had them filed into fangs so she could rip people\\'s throats out. She\\'s committed. I\\'ll give her that. Wiress and Beetee. Not fighters, but brilliant. And weird. Real tech-savvy. He won his Games by electrocuting six Tributes at once. The Morphlings. Masters of camouflage. Basically, won their Games by hiding until everyone else was dead. Self-medicating ever since. Which I applaud. Not a threat. Finnick Odair, right? Yes. He won his Games at 14. Youngest ever. - Extremely humble. - You\\'re kidding. Yes, I\\'m kidding. He\\'s a peacock. A total preener. But he\\'s The Capitol darling. They love him here. Charming, smart, and very skilled at combat. Especially in water. - What about weaknesses? - One. Mags. She volunteered for Annie. Mags was his mentor and basically raised him. If he\\'s trying to protect her in any way, it exposes him. A guy like that has to know she\\'s not gonna make it. I bet when it really comes down to it, he won\\'t protect her. Well, Katniss, I just hope when she goes, she goes quickly. She\\'s actually a wonderful lady. How\\'d we get here? Katniss. Hello, Finnick. Do you want a sugar cube? I mean, it\\'s supposed to be for the horses, but... I mean, who cares about them, right? They got years to eat sugar, whereas you and I... Well, if we see something sweet, we better grab it. No thanks. But I would love to borrow that outfit someday. You look pretty terrifying in that getup. What happened to the pretty little girl dresses? I outgrew them. You certainly did. Shame about this Quell thing. Now, you could\\'ve made out like a bandit in The Capitol. Jewels, money, anything you wanted. Well, I don\\'t like jewels and I have more money than I need, so... What did you do with all your wealth, anyway? I haven\\'t dealt in anything as common as money in years. Then how do people pay for the pleasure of your company? With secrets. What about you, Girl on Fire? Any secrets worth my time? I\\'m an open book. Everybody always seems to know my secrets before I know them myself. Unfortunately, I think that\\'s true. I\\'m sorry you had to cancel your wedding. I know how devastating that must be for you. Have a good day. - Peeta. - Finnick. What\\'d he want? To know all my secrets. He\\'ll have to get in line. Tributes, mount up. No waving and smiling, this time. I want you to look straight ahead as if the audience and this whole event are beneath you. That should be easy. Press this when you\\'re ready. Good luck. Here they come! From District 12. Our favorites. - Well... - Or my favorite. There it is! Fire in the house! Katniss! Katniss! Katniss! Nice. Way to make friends out there, you two. Well, we learned from the best. I wanna introduce you to some special friends of mine. This is Seeder. And Chaff. From District 11. He\\'s very friendly. Don\\'t invite him over. He\\'ll drink up your liquor. I\\'ll see you guys soon. Let\\'s get some of that makeup off you and talk about these other Tributes. These Tributes are crazy. No, not all of \\'em. He\\'s a good guy. Carry on. You guys look amazing. Thank you. My stylist is such an idiot. District 7. Lumber. Trees. I\\'d love to put my ax in her face. So what do you think? Now that the whole world wants to sleep with you? - I don\\'t think that the whole world... - I wasn\\'t talking to you. Okay. Will you unzip? Yeah. Thanks. Let\\'s do it again sometime. Thank you. Johanna Mason, District 7. Remember, Katniss, today\\'s about making allies. So far I\\'m not overwhelmed by our choices. I guess we just try to figure out who we trust least and work our way backwards from there. Friction generates heat. Heat generates fire. In theory. You should move your hands downward. And faster, too. - A little brute force... -...is always helpful. Thank you. By the corner of the table. Plutarch? No. Next to him. Force field. How do you know? The shimmering. Top left hand side. Look. There. You see it? Looks like glass. To separate us and them. Probably my fault. I shot an arrow at them last year. Electromagnetic. How can you tell? Is it obvious or something? \"Is it obvious?\" - They might as well have a sign. - Look around you. All the holograms, the lights, every now and then they flicker. Why? Because the force field is taking up too much energy. There\\'s always a flaw in the system. That\\'s beautiful. I saw you volunteer for that young girl. It was really brave. Prim is my sister. If you If you teach me how to make a fishhook like that, I could teach you how to hunt. Yes, yes. Do you wanna try with me? Okay. I\\'ll go first. Good news. At least half the Tributes want you as an ally. Well, they saw her shoot. Well, sweetheart, you got your pick of the litter. I want Wiress and Beetee. Johanna calls them \"Nuts\" and \"Volts.\" - Well, okay, good. Now, who else? - Mags. All right, fine, then no one. I\\'ll tell them you\\'re still making up your mind. District 3. Beetee Latter. Report for individual assessment. Peeta, how are we gonna kill these people? District 12. Katniss Everdeen. Report for individual assessment. Miss Everdeen. Miss Everdeen! You have 10 minutes to present your chosen skill. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you for being here tonight on the eve of the 75th Hunger Games! We have never seen anything like this. And we will never see anything like it again. Because tonight, on this stage, 24 of Panem\\'s brightest stars will vie for the ultimate crown. Tonight will be their final opportunity to express their thoughts. Our final opportunity to express our love. And heartbreakingly, to say goodbye to all but one. What a night. Let\\'s hear it. It\\'s so exciting! A wedding dress? President Snow insisted, but I made a few alterations. You two made The Games a family affair. You became everyone\\'s brother and sister. I don\\'t know how we\\'re going to let you go. We\\'re not going by choice. You are our family. And I don\\'t see how anyone can love us better. So sweet. So sweet. Are you all right, dear? - I\\'m sorry. - That\\'s all right. I just can\\'t stop crying. God! Does anybody actually believe this? Apparently, everybody. She is very good. These Victors are angry, Katniss. They\\'ll say anything to try and stop The Games. I suggest you do the same. Beetee... You have contributed so much to Panem over the years. I don\\'t know who we will miss more. You or your brain. If the Quarter Quell were written into law by men, certainly, it can be unwritten. Yes. Interesting concept. Finnick... I understand that you have a message for somebody out there. A special somebody. Can we hear it? My love, you have my heart for all eternity and if I die in that arena, my last thought will be of your lips. We have seen a lot of tears here tonight. But I see no tears in Johanna\\'s eyes. Johanna, you are angry. Tell me why. Well, yes, I\\'m angry. You know, I\\'m getting totally screwed over here. The deal was that if I win the Hunger Games, I get to live the rest of my life in peace. But now you want to kill me again. Well, you know what? ...that! And...everybody that had anything to do with it! All right then. One woman\\'s opinion. Who\\'s next? All right, turn around. I know it\\'s a bad break for everyone involved. I think I\\'m done. Will I be twirling tonight? Save it for the end. One minute. Is she ready? Katniss. You would have been the most beautiful bride. Thank you. Let\\'s go show them what real beauty looks like. It has to go more up. Pretty, pretty, Katniss, they\\'re going to adore you. And there are a lot of sponsors in the audience, so of course, just be your usual self. Actually, be your happier self. Really? A wedding dress? Snow made me wear it. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome... - You know her... - Make him pay for it. ...as the Girl on Fire. The Victor of last year\\'s Hunger Games. Katniss Everdeen! Katniss Everdeen, you look fabulous. Doesn\\'t she? My, my! Now, Katniss, this is a very big and very emotional night for all of us. Wouldn\\'t you say? Don\\'t go crying on me now, Caesar. I can\\'t make any promises. You know me. You know I wouldn\\'t believe you, even if you did. I love her! The Girl on Fire is so cheeky. But, Katniss, on a more serious note. I think we\\'re all here a little disappointed, more than a little disappointed, that a certain wedding did not take place. Aren\\'t we, folks? Alas. But am I correct in assuming that this is the gown that you would have worn on that day, yes or no? Yes, President Snow thought everyone would want to see it. Well, President Snow, as usual, was right. Was he not, folks? I love it! I love it! Don\\'t you love it, folks? It\\'s incredible. It\\'s so gorgeous. Will you do us the honor? Please? Please? Please? Oh, my God! Oh, my! It\\'s a bird. It\\'s got feathers. It\\'s like a bird. It\\'s like a... Like a Mockingjay. Your stylist certainly has outdone himself this time, hasn\\'t he? What theatricality! Cinna! Take a bow. But, Peeta, the wedding, the marriage, never to be? Well, actually, we got married. In secret. A secret wedding? All right. Do tell. - We want our love to be eternal. - Of course. You know, Katniss and I, we\\'ve been luckier than most. And I wouldn\\'t have any regrets at all if it weren\\'t... If... If it weren\\'t for what? What? If it weren\\'t for the baby. All right. This is news! Let\\'s find out more. Calm down. This is news to all of us. Call off The Games! All right. - Let\\'s... - Stop The Games! Everybody, calm down. It\\'s a great night. A great night. This is news to all of us. All right, all right, all right. We\\'re going to find out what we do about this. Cancel The Games! Stop The Games! There\\'s no way they\\'ll cancel. They can\\'t. Baby bomb was a stroke of genius. Unfortunately, Games are still on. This is goodbye, for now. Presents for the boys. What is this? Your token. Remember? Hair for me. Pin for Katniss. Gold bangle for you. And for Peeta, the medallion that we talked about. Thank you, Effie. We\\'re a team. Aren\\'t we? And I\\'m so proud of my Victors. So proud. You\\'re so... Well, you both deserved so much better. Thank you, Effie. I am truly sorry. Thank you, Haymitch. For everything. Any last advice? Stay alive. Haymitch, wait. Remember our deal. Do whatever it takes to keep him alive. Promise me. Okay. Katniss, when you\\'re in the arena, remember who the real enemy is. I don\\'t want to be with anyone else in there. Just you. If that\\'s what you want. That\\'s what I want. I\\'ll see you soon. Your tracker. Look at this. They\\'re holding hands. I want them dead. Be patient. They\\'re holding hands now, but the minute the gun goes off, it\\'ll be a bloodbath. And the whole idea of revolution will be discredited. And the idea of her? The idea of the Mockingjay? The more allies she betrays, the more friends she kills, the more she reveals her true self. As long as it ends with her picture in the sky and the sound of cannon. - And it shall. - It better. Let\\'s watch her get her hands dirty first. Excuse me. Let\\'s start. This suit is light. No thermal. So I\\'d guess tropics or desert. Sixty seconds to launch. That dress was beautiful. I think it was the best one you\\'ve ever made. I thought you\\'d like it. I just wanted to tell you, because I don\\'t... Stop. Remember, I\\'m still betting on you, Girl on Fire. Ten seconds to launch. No! Cinna! No! No!No!No! No! Cinna! No! No! No! No! No, no... Let the 75th Hunger Games begin. May the odds be ever in your favor. Peeta? Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, One Good thing we\\'re allies, right? Where did you get that? Where do you think? Duck. Don\\'t trust 1 and 2. I\\'ll take this side. You hold them off. I\\'ll go find Peeta. Katniss, Mags found him. He\\'s over here. Katniss, Katniss, go, go, go, go. Okay, hold up. Hold up. Here you go. Okay. You all right now? Okay? God, it\\'s hot. We gotta find fresh water. Well, I guess we\\'re not holding hands any more. You think that\\'s funny? Every time that cannon goes off, it\\'s music to my ears. I don\\'t care about any of them. Good to hear. Want to face the Career Pack alone? What would Haymitch say? Haymitch isn\\'t here. Let\\'s keep moving. Peeta, no! Peeta? Peeta? He\\'s not breathing. He\\'s not breathing. He\\'s not breathing! Peeta! Peeta? Peeta? Come on! Come on! Please, wake up. No. Please, wake up. - Come on. - Come on! Bring me in closer. Cannon ready? Come on. Come on. Come on, Peeta! Please, Peeta. Peeta. Come on. Peeta? Peeta. Oh, my God. Be careful. There\\'s a force field up there. Oh, my God. You were dead. You were dead. Your heart stopped. It\\'s okay. It\\'s working now. - You... Do you wanna stand up? - Yeah. It\\'s okay. Someday I want to love someone that much. And so you shall, my darling. So you shall. Hang on. The force field... It\\'s a dome. We\\'re at the edge of the arena. We couldn\\'t find any signs of fresh water. It\\'s gonna get dark soon. We\\'ll be safe with our backs protected. We should set up camp. Take turns sleeping. I can take first watch. Not a chance. Honey, that thing I did back there for Peeta? That was called \"saving his life.\" If I wanted to kill either of you, I would\\'ve done it by now. Why don\\'t you get some rest? I\\'ll take the first watch. Just for a little bit. How\\'s Peeta? He\\'s okay, I think. Just dehydrated like the rest of us. Eight. Hey. Drink up\"? What is it? It\\'s from Haymitch. I think it\\'s a spile. A What? You\\'re kidding me. You\\'re kidding me. Get some water. I\\'m gonna get a leaf. I\\'ll get some for Mags. There we go. Want some more? I counted 12. Midnight? Or the number of districts. Well... If you\\'re not gonna sleep, I will. Okay. Run! Run! The fog is poison! Come on, come on, come on There! God! God! Mags, please, please! Come on! Come on! Peeta. I can\\'t carry him. Peeta, please. Peeta, please, stand up. We have to go. Mags? - Mags? Mags! - Finnick. - Mags! - Finnick. Mags! Finnick! Finnick, we have to go. We have to get outta here. We have to go. All right, come on, come on. Come on. Okay. Shit! The water! The water helps. We need our weapons. I\\'m sorry about Mags. She was never gonna make it. So... What? - Peeta. - Yeah? Walk over here slowly. Get to the beach. We gotta get to the beach! - Who is that? - A Morphling! Help me get her! Hey, hey, hey. It\\'s okay. It\\'s okay. Hey, you wanna see something? Look up. Look. Look at it. Look at that. It\\'s incredible, isn\\'t it? All those colors. Don\\'t worry about anything else. I\\'ll be right here with you. It\\'s okay. It\\'s okay. She sacrificed herself for me and I didn\\'t even know her name. You think she sacrificed herself? Looked like it. That doesn\\'t make any sense. Look. For you. Thank you. That\\'s new. Someone\\'s here. Johanna? - Johanna! - Finnick! Guess we have more allies. Well... I got \\'em out. We were all the way deep into the jungle where I thought it was gonna be safe. That\\'s when the rain started. I thought it was water. It turned out to be blood. - Tick took. - Hot, thick blood. - It was coming down. - Tick took. It was choking us. We were stumbling around, gagging on it, blind. Tick took. - That\\'s when Blight hit the force field. - Tick took. Tick took. He wasn\\'t much, but he was from home. Tick took. Tick took. - Tick took. - What\\'s wrong with her? - She\\'s in shock. - Tick took. Dehydration isn\\'t helping. Do you have fresh water? - We can get some. - Just... Tick took. Listen. Stop it! - Hey! Lay off her! - Just sit down! Hey! What are you doing? - Hey, hey, hey! - I got them out for you! It\\'s okay. It\\'s okay. Let me go, Finnick! - For me? What does that mean? - Let me go. - You did want them as allies. - I\\'m fine. Come on, let\\'s get you cleaned up. Tick took. - Tick took. - Tick took! Tick took, okay. What does Beetee have there? The coil? It\\'s some kind of wire. Did he get it from the Cornucopia? Took a knife in the back to get it. - Tick took! Tick took! - All right. I can\\'t. Just... Have fun with \"Nuts.\" Tick took. Tick took. It\\'s a clock. It\\'s a clock. My God, it\\'s a clock! Wiress, you\\'re a genius. You\\'re a genius! This entire arena seems to be laid out like a clock with a new threat every hour, but they stay only within their wedge. It all starts with the lightning. Then the blood rain, fog, monkeys. That\\'s the first four hours. At 10:00, that big wave hits from over there. Wiress, you\\'re a genius. Look, the tail points to 12. That\\'s where the lightning strikes at noon and midnight. - Strikes where? - That big tree. Good. \"Hickory dickory dock. The mouse ran up the clock. \"The clock struck one, the mouse ran down. \"Hickory dickory dock.\" So 12:00 to 1:00, lightning. Then 1:00 to 2:00 is blood. Then fog. And then monkeys. \"Hickory dickory dock. The dog barked at the clock. \"The clock struck 3:00...\" And then 10:00 to 11:00, the wave. What about everything else? Did you guys see anything? \"Hickory dickory dock.\" - Nothing but blood. - It doesn\\'t matter. As long as we steer clear of whichever sector is active, we\\'ll be safe. Yeah. Relatively speaking. Change it up. Spin it. Come on! Come on! Hold on! No! Okay. That\\'s enough. Let\\'s see how they tell time now. You Okay? Let\\'s just get what we need and get off the bloody island. So besides Brutus and Enobaria, who\\'s left? Maybe Chaff. - Just those three. - They know they\\'re outnumbered. I doubt they\\'ll attack again. We\\'re safe here on the beach. So what do we do? We hunt \\'em down? Katniss, help me! Prim! - Prim! Prim! - No! Katniss! Katniss, wait! Prim! Prim! Prim! Prim! Katniss! Help me! Help me! Katniss! - You okay? - Finnick! Finnick! - No! It\\'s not her. - Annie! Annie! - Annie! Annie! - Finnick! It\\'s not her. It\\'s just a jabberjay. It\\'s not her. Well, how do you think they got that sound? - Jabberjays copy. - Katniss! Gale. Come on, come on, come on! Peeta! Stop, stop, stop! It\\'s okay! It\\'s okay! They\\'re just mutts! It\\'s not real! It\\'s over. It\\'s okay. They\\'re gone. The hour\\'s gone. The hour\\'s up. It\\'s all right. - Prim! Find Prim! - No, no. Prim\\'s okay. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I\\'m fine. I\\'m fine. Okay? They won\\'t touch Prim. All right? Your fiancé\\'s right. The whole country loves your sister. If they tortured her or did anything to her, forget the districts, there would be riots in the damn Capitol. Hey, how does that sound, Snow? What if we set your backyard on fire? You know, you can\\'t put everybody in here. What? They can\\'t hurt me. There\\'s no one left that I love. I\\'ll get you some water. Thank you. Who\\'s Annie? Annie Cresta. The girl Mags volunteered for. She won, like, four years... Five years ago. Is she the one that went a little... Love is weird. I have a plan. Finnick! I have a plan. Where do the Careers feel safest? The jungle? The jungle\\'s a nightmare. Probably here on the beach. Then why are they not here? Because we are. We claimed it. And if we left, they would come. Or stay hidden in the tree line. Which in just over four hours will be soaked with water from the 10:00 wave. And what happens at midnight? - Lightning strikes that tree. - Here\\'s what I propose. We leave the beach at dusk. We head to the lightning tree. That should draw them back to the beach. Prior to midnight, we then run this wire from the tree to the water. Anyone in the water or on the damp sand will be electrocuted. How do we know the wire\\'s not gonna burn up? Because I invented it. I assure you, it won\\'t burn up. Well, it\\'s better than hunting them down. Yeah, why not? If it fails, no harm done anyway, right? All right, I say we try it. So what can we do to help? Keep me alive for the next six hours. That would be extremely helpful. I think we need to go. This plan\\'s gonna work. I think so, too. And once the Careers are dead, we both know what happens next. I don\\'t want to be the one that shoots first. What if they don\\'t either? What if all of us refuse to shoot first? We might still end up dead. Maybe not. I mean, it worked for us last time. They\\'re not gonna make that same mistake again. You know and I know there\\'s only one person walking out of here. And it\\'s gonna be one of us. The Careers are still out there. We should stick with these guys till midnight. And if we hear a cannon, we go. Katniss, I don\\'t know what kinda deals you made with Haymitoh but he made me promises, too. If you die and I live, I\\'d have nothing. Nobody else that I care about. Peeta. It\\'s different for you. Your family needs you. You have to live. For them. What about you? Nobody needs me. I do. I need you. All right, lovebirds! She is preparing to fight. That\\'s our girl. This is what you predicted. Moves and countermoves. Indeed. We\\'ll toast when it\\'s done? In the meantime, make yourself comfortable. Minimal charring. It\\'s an impressive conductor. Let\\'s get started. Typically a lightning strike contains five billion joules of energy. We don\\'t want to be anywhere in the vicinity when this hits. You two girls, go together now. Take this. Unspool it carefully. Make sure the entire coil is in the water. You understand? Then head to the tree at the 2:00 sector. We\\'ll meet you there. I\\'m gonna go with them as a guard. No,no,no. You\\'re staying here to protect me. And the tree. No, I need to go with her. There are two Careers out there. I need two guards. Finnick can protect you just fine on his own. Why can\\'t Finnick and Johanna stay with you and Peeta and I\\'ll take the coil? You all agreed to keep me alive till midnight, correct? It\\'s his plan. We all agreed to it. Is there a problem here? Excellent question. No. There\\'s no problem. I\\'ll see you at midnight. All right, let\\'s go! Come on. I want to put as much distance between me and this beach as possible. Frying is not how I want to go. There\\'s something... Stay down. Come on. Johanna, where are you? Johanna? Peeta. Peeta. Beetee. Beetee! Peeta! Peeta! Katniss, where are you? Let it fly, Miss Everdeen. Let it fly. Katniss. Remember who the real enemy is. Katniss, get away from that tree! Katniss, get away from that tree! It\\'s not possible. Heavensbee! Plutarch Heavensbee! Sir, we\\'ve lost power. She\\'s gonna lose it when she finds out about the boy. She\\'ll still cooperate, though? Without Peeta? There\\'s no guarantee. Just tell her her win... Morning, sweetheart. What are you doing with them? You and a syringe against The Capitol? See, this is why no one lets you make the plans. - What the hell are you doing in here? - Stop. Stop. Just listen. We couldn\\'t tell you with Snow watching. It was too risky. Better for you to know nothing. Where\\'s Peeta? Now, Katniss... You have been our mission from the beginning. The plan was always to get you out. Half the Tributes were in on it. This is the revolution. And you are the Mockingjay. And we\\'re on our way to District 13 right now. 13? 13. Yes. Where\\'s Peeta? He still has his tracker in his arm. Johanna cut yours out. Where is he? In The Capitol. They got him and Johanna. You son of a bitch! You son of a... You promised me that you would save him over me! You promised me! You\\'re a liar. You\\'re a liar. Hey, Catnip. You\\'re okay. You\\'ve just been asleep for a few days. Are we home? Gale? Where\\'s Prim? She\\'s alive. So is your mother. I got \\'em out in time. Got them out? After The Games, they sent in hovercrafts. And they started dropping firebombs. They\\'re not in 12? There is no District 12.'\n",

\\'special reason\\'whether appeal has prospects of successmigration BACKGROUND  1 This is an application, filed on 21 November 2006, for an extension of time in which to appeal against orders made by a Federal Magistrate on 25 October 2006.His Honour dismissed the applicant\\'s application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal made on 28 January 2005.The Tribunal\\'s decision affirmed the decision of a delegate of the first respondent refusing the applicant the grant of a protection visa.2 The applicant claims to be a citizen of the People\\'s Republic of China and claims to fear persecution because he is a Falun Gong practitioner.3 On 17 December 2004, the Tribunal invited the applicant to attend a hearing, which was to be held on 18 January 2005.The applicant did not respond to the invitation and did not attend the hearing.4 Pursuant to s 426A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), the Tribunal proceeded to make its decision on 28 January 2005, without taking further action to enable the applicant to appear before it.The Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate because, based on the evidence before it, it was unable to be satisfied that the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason.5 The applicant sought judicial review of the Tribunal\\'s decision in the Federal Magistrates Court.In that Court, the applicant relied on an amended application filed on 10 October 2005.This amended application contained nine paragraphs, which may be read as grounds.The first ground asserted an error of law on the Tribunal\\'s part, although there were no particulars given.Most of the remaining paragraphs concerned the merits of the applicant\\'s claims before the Tribunal and invited an inquiry that this Court was not at liberty to make.6 The Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal had complied with its statutory obligations and was entitled to proceed in the appellant\\'s absence.His Honour accepted that, as the Tribunal could not be satisfied that the applicant was someone to whom protection obligations were owed, it \"was entitled, indeed it was probably compelled\" to affirm the delegate\\'s decision.7 The applicant seeks an extension of time in which to appeal against the judgment of the Federal Magistrate.There was to be a hearing in Sydney at 2.15pm on 21 February 2007 but the applicant did not appear.Upon investigating the file, I discovered that the applicant had given two addresses for service (or one address for service and another residential address) on two different documents filed the same day and that the notice of listing had only be sent to one of those addresses.I determined that the appropriate course was to adjourn the matter to enable letters to be sent to the applicant at both addresses.8 On 21 February 2007, my chambers sent letters, by registered post, to the applicant at both addresses, notifying him that the application had been listed for hearing at 10.15am on 1 March 2007.The letters also stated that the Court might hear and determine the application in the applicant\\'s absence on that date.Additionally, the letters gave the applicant the opportunity to file and serve written submissions in support of his application.Nothing has been received from the applicant.9 On 28 February 2007, my associate attempted to telephone the applicant on the number provided on the application.There was no answer.There is no appearance for the applicant today.In these circumstances, I would dismiss the application under O 35A r 2(1)(f) and r 3 (1)(a) of the Federal Court Rules .The first respondent also referred me to s 25(2B)(bb)(ii) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).10 Whilst perhaps unnecessary to say so, it seems on the material before the Court that this application is bound to fail in any event.11 Order 52 r 15(1)(a) of the Federal Court Rules provides that a notice of appeal is to be filed 21 days from the date of judgment.In this case, this period ended on 15 November 2006.The application for an extension of time was filed on 21 November 2006.Pursuant to O 52 r 15(2), the time limit may be extended for \\'special reasons\\'.In Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187, a Full Court of this Court said, at 195:  \"...the expression \\'special reasons\\' is intended to distinguish the case from the usual course according to which the time is twenty-one days.But it may be so distinguished (not necessarily will, for the rule gives a discretion) wherever the Court sees a ground which does justify departure from the general rule in the particular case.Such a ground is a special reason because it takes the case out of the ordinary.We do not think the use of the expression \\'for special reasons\\' implies something narrower than this.\"  12 The applicant was present in Court on 25 October 2006, when the Federal Magistrate delivered his ex tempore reasons.An interpreter was also present to assist him.He has not adduced any evidence that might explain the delay in lodging his notice of appeal.He has not adduced any evidence of \\'special reasons\\' that would satisfy the Court that an extension of time should be granted.13 Further, as the first respondent submitted in written submissions, the proposed appeal would appear to have insufficient prospects of success to justify an extension of time.The applicant\\'s draft notice of appeal claims that: (a) the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court involved an important exercise of power; (b) the Tribunal failed to provide the applicant with procedural fairness; and (c) he is entitled to a protection visa.The applicant\\'s supporting affidavit rehearses the merits of his claim that he is entitled to a protection visa.I put the first claim to one side since it does not raise any ground for review.I also put the third ground aside since it invites an inquiry into the merits of the applicant\\'s visa application that the Court is not at liberty to make.Neither of these grounds is capable of raising jurisdictional error.Only the applicant\\'s second claim is capable of raising possible jurisdictional error.14 The applicant\\'s claim that the Tribunal failed to provide him with procedural fairness is unparticularised.Presumably the applicant intended to contest the making of a decision adverse to him in his absence.The Tribunal is, however, authorised by s 426A to make a decision in an applicant\\'s absence if the applicant has been invited under s 425 to appear before the Tribunal and does not appear in accordance with that invitation.In the circumstances of this case, there was nothing to indicate that the Tribunal\\'s determination to make a decision \"without taking any further action to allow or enable the applicant to appear before it\" was vitiated by any legal error.15 The Federal Magistrate was, therefore, entitled to find that the Tribunal had complied with its statutory obligations.In addition, as I have already said, the applicant\\'s claim that he is entitled to a protection visa is not a matter for this Court, since it seeks to review the merits of the Tribunal\\'s finding and the Court cannot review these merits.As the appeal is apparently without prospect of success, a grant of leave would be futile.16 I would dismiss with costs this application for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal.I certify that the preceding sixteen (16) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Kenny.Associate:Dated: 1 March 2007

      " 'I busied myself to think of a story... ...which would speak to the mysterious fears of our nature... ...and awaken thrilling horror. One to make the reader dread to look around. To curdle the blood, and quicken the beatings of the heart. Tell the captain, we\\'ve got to take in the topsail. She\\'s going to rip! Please, captain! We have to drop the sails! All hands to the mast! Take the wheel! Come on! Captain, we\\'ve hit the ice! We\\'ve hit the ice! Iceberg ahead! Hard to starboard! Go back! Help! Help! -Help! -Hold on, Vernon! Hold on! Put your backs into it, men! Let\\'s go! Captain, this is useless. The ice stretches for miles. What do you suggest we do? Lay down and die? The men are exhausted, sir. They can\\'t go on, man. I tell you, I have not come this far to give up now. They knew the risk when they signed on. And we are gonna chop our way to the North Pole if we have to. Then you run the risk of mutiny, captain. -Did you say mutiny? -Yes I did, sir. We proceed north as planned. At the cost of how many more lives? As many as it takes! There\\'s something out there. What is it? What the hell is that? Who is your captain? I am. Who the devil are you? I\\'ve no time to talk. You bring your men and your weapons and follow me. -Now! -Stay where you are. I give the orders here. Get the dogs! Get them! Leave them. They\\'re already dead. Get back to the ship now! Everybody back to the ship! Bears don\\'t kill like that, nothing does. Maybe it wants the man with the captain. -Or it wants the captain. -The devil\\'s come for the captain. For the last time, I made my way from St. Petersburg to Archangel on foot. From there I took a whaling ship north. When we hit the ice, I used the dogs. What\\'s out there? Listen to me. I have spent six years planning this, my entire fortune. I will not be stopped by you or some phantom. Do you share my madness? -No, not madness. -What, then? There\\'s a passage to the North Pole, and I will find it. At the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew? Lives come and go. If we succeed, our names will live on forever. I will be hailed as the benefactor of our species. You\\'re wrong. I, of all men, know that. Who are you? My name... ...is Victor... ...Frankenstein. Mother! Oh, my wonderful son Victor! You are the handsomest, kindest, cleverest... ...most wonderfulest boy in the whole world! Madam! You will spoil the boy, really. Would you two leave us, please, Mrs. Moritz? Doctor. Come along, Justine. Victor, this is Elizabeth. She\\'s coming to live with us. She\\'s lost both her mother and father to the scarlet fever, Victor. She\\'s an orphan now. You must think of her as your own sister. You must look after her, and be kind to her. Always. Mother, oh. How is the imminent arrival? Oh, a little frisky today. When you were a little boy, you used to chase fireflies in the field. Yes, and when I trapped them in my jar, they died. -And do you remember how you cried? -Yes. Because you wanted to keep them glowing by your bedside... ...to light you as you read. You were so hungry for knowledge. Such a serious little boy. You\\'ve become such an earnest young man. All these strange and ancient books. You\\'ll be an even greater doctor than your father. But you know, Victor, life shouldn\\'t be all study. There\\'s such fun to be had. -Give me that back. -No. Give me that back, Mother. Change partners. And twirl! -Now, Caroline. -You\\'re right. -You mustn\\'t exert yourself. Please. -I know. Don\\'t worry, madam. Your new baby will be a natural dancer. Excellent. You\\'ll be the envy of all the young ladies and gentlemen. Justine. Justine, may I have this dance? -Madam! -Hurry! You must make a decision! How can I? The baby\\'s in the wrong position. I can\\'t proceed.... I can\\'t.... Cut me. Save the baby. She\\'ll be all right. Your father\\'s the finest doctor in Geneva. Father? Father? Father, how is she? I did everything I could.... Everything I could.... Mother? Mother! Bring her back. Please, bring her back. No! Please, bring her back. Oh, Mother. You should never have died. No one need ever die. I will stop this. I will stop this. I promise. Victor, you\\'re completely obsessed. Please explain what that is. It\\'s energy. It never disappears, it merely changes form. It\\'s possible to convert this candle wax... ...into the convulsions of a mechanical dog. But the applications of this are limitless. Really. Oh, please come outside, Victor. It\\'s such a beautiful day. Go away, I\\'m busy. What\\'s this? It\\'s for spraying down the electric eels. Now, put it down. Put it down. It\\'s not for playing with. It\\'s not for playing with. Put it down, put it down-- Don\\'t do that. I warned you. Don\\'t-- Don\\'t-- Give me that, you little.... Come on! Come on! We should be grateful to Victor... ...for abandoning his experiments for one afternoon. Well, who says I have? What do you mean? Look! We\\'re all going to die. -You knew this would happen. -Not for certain. But I had hoped the conditions would be right. They\\'re common here. I\\'ve never seen one quite as large, though. Look. -Isn\\'t it wonderful? -Victor, you shouldn\\'t have done this. It\\'s all right, it\\'s all right. -We must take cover. A tree! -That\\'s exactly the wrong thing to do. It\\'s a much larger conductor than we are. Victor, what about Willie? -What are we to do? -Come on. Spread out. Elizabeth, take this. Now, quickly. -Come on, quickly! -What is that? Dig it right into the ground. Go ahead. -Now what? -Justine, take this. Come on. -Willie! -Everyone down. Give me your hands. It\\'ll be fine. Now take him. Now, that\\'s good. I hope you know what you\\'re doing. -Willie? Willie, don\\'t look up! -Willie. -Victor-- -Wait! One, two, three.... Now. So how do you feel, Elizabeth? Alive. Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends. Gather round and listen. As you probably know, tomorrow my dear son Victor... ...leaves me to pursue, what I\\'m sure... ...will be an illustrious career in a profession... ...I am not altogether unassociated with. Oh, modesty. My one regret is that his mother... ...my late wife, is not here... ...to share the pride... ...which our son fills me with tonight. Yes. She wanted you to have this, Victor. On your graduation. And in it she has written: \"This is the journal of Victor Frankenstein.\" The rest of the leaves are blank... ...to be filled with the deeds of a noble life. We\\'d better go in, before they miss us. Just a little while longer. Please. I don\\'t know when we\\'ll be alone together again. Oh, dear Victor. I shall miss you laughing at me. I\\'ll miss you making me laugh. So how do brothers and sisters say goodbye? Perhaps they never have to. I won\\'t, if you won\\'t. Are you my sister? Sister... ...friend... ...lover. Wife? Yes. Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now. -Victor, no. -Well, then I\\'ll stay. I want more than anything else in the world to be your wife. But as long as you\\'re away, I belong here. I want to make this house live again. I want to make this a great home for our children. And now you must go, and do the great things you need to do. I want you so much. I\\'ll be here when you return. Each holiday. Every visit. Then on our wedding night. Until our wedding night. Lots of stairs, I\\'m afraid. -How was your journey? -Good, thanks. I made good progress... -...over the mountains. -I am pleased. -As I said, we\\'ve only got attic space. -It\\'s exactly what I\\'m looking for. But Frau Brach, there will be a great deal... ...of scientific equipment and rigging to be delivered. Every day, for the next week. I trust you have no objections. I\\'m sure you appreciate the need for a proper laboratory. Oh, Putzi likes you. This will be perfect. \"The foolish and vain force their views by the rod. But knowledge is power only through God.\" Our motto. Easily forgotten by you young men in a hurry. But perhaps the greatest mistake that all students make... ...during their time here, is to suppose... ...that they can ever have an original or creative thought. We have all imagined that in our time. But gentlemen, you have not come here in order to think for yourselves. You are here to learn how to think for your patients. You must learn, therefore, in the first place... ...to submit yourselves... ...to the established laws of physical reality. But surely, professor... ...you don\\'t intend we disregard more philosophical approaches? Philosophical? Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect, as in Paracelsus. Paracelsus. An arrogant and foolish Swiss. Albertus Magnus? His nonsense was exploded 500 years ago. Cornelius Agrippa? A sorcerer. An occultist. What is your name? Victor Frankenstein, sir. Of Geneva. Another Swiss. Mr. Frankenstein, here at the University of Ingolstadt, we teach-- And indeed, hope to advance. --the science of medicine. Chemistry, biology, physics. We study hard science. Surely, the greatest possible advances lie in combining these things. We do not study the ravings of lunatics and alchemists... ...hundreds of years in their graves... ...because their kind of amateur, fanatical, fantastical speculation... ...does not heal bodies or save lives. Only science can do that. Now, have we your permission to continue? -Nice coat. -Why, thank you. Don\\'t take it too hard. Krempe doesn\\'t approve of public humiliation. -I am not mad! -My dear fellow, of course you\\'re not. In fact, that\\'s just what I\\'d expect a perfectly rational person... ...to say to a complete stranger. Henry Clerval, by the way, and I\\'m completely crazy. -Victor Frankenstein. -Of Geneva. -Of Geneva. -Yes, I noti-- Why don\\'t you look where I\\'m going? That\\'s Schiller. Ornament of the playing field. -Really. -He\\'s new as well. You can tell because he goes around looking at things with his mouth open. What are you here for? -Research. -Very grand. I\\'m here to become a mere doctor. I\\'m told it has something to do with healing the sick. Which is a pity, really, because I find sick people rather revolting. Still, I\\'ll have a good time, get my degree-- If I can stop failing Anatomy. --and settle down to relieve rich old ladies of their imaginary ailments... ...and then relieve their very real and beautiful daughters. -Who was that? He was at the lecture. -That\\'s Waldman. -That\\'s Waldman. -Yes. Interesting case. They say in his youth... ...he could break into heaven and lecture God on science. Ran into trouble with the authorities years back. Something to do with illegal experiments. But what kind of experiments, I wonder? So what was it you were saying? Rich old ladies and their daughters? Yes, it\\'s a life of sacrifice, I know, but someone\\'s got to do it. And that is why the central nervous system... ...and its crowning achievement, the brain... ...are as complicated and mysterious a set of organs... ...as you are ever likely to encounter. Mr. Frankenstein, the incision is yours. Excellent. Mr. Clerval, you may remove the cranial lid. \"Henry, now fully recovered, continues his struggle to pass Anatomy.\" I was always terrible at anatomy. \"Professor Waldman is very tolerant of us. I\\'m learning a great deal.\" -Professor Waldman is remarkable. -And so is Henry. \"God bless you, all my love, Victor.\" -That\\'s very nice. -\"P.S. I\\'ve fallen in love.\" I beg your pardon? \"She\\'s dark, sleek, and beautiful... ...and always wags her tail whenever she sees me. Her name is Putzi, and she\\'s the friendliest sheepdog that I\\'ve known.\" \"P.S. Elizabeth, I dream of how your hair shines....\" \"Of how your lips taste. I dream of your arms and breasts... ...and of the time on our wedding night... ...when we will be alone together at last.\" What else does it say? It says, \"I\\'m working very hard to make lots of new friends.\" More coffee, anyone? Once and for all, Frankenstein! Life is life, death is death. These things are real. -They are absolute. -That is rubbish and you know it! That premise has been repeatedly challenged by your own staff! Yes, you, sir! We don\\'t know where life ends or death begins. Hair continues to grow after what we choose to call death. So do fingernails. We know that a man\\'s brain may die... ...but his heart and lungs may continue to pump and breathe. Now, you know that. Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva, I warn you... ...what you are suggesting is not only illegal, it is immoral. Rubbish! \"Dear diary, why does no one understand me? P.S. I am not mad.\" You. -Explain yourself. -Professor, I\\'m sorry. Listen, I came here to learn all about the new science. About galvanism, Franklin\\'s experiments. Combination of modern disciplines with ancient knowledge... -...to protect and create-- -To create what? Sir, we can change things. We can make things better. You know that. We are on the verge of undreamed-of discoveries... ...if we only have the courage to ask the right questions. You must help me. Come on. -Victor.... -Come on. Henry. Lock the door. Now, for thousands of years... ...the Chinese have based their medical science on the belief... ...that the human body is a chemical engine run by energy streams. -Fascinating. How do they explain--? -Don\\'t touch that! Their doctors treat patients... ...by inserting needles like these into the flesh... ...at various key points, to manipulate these electric streams. I see. So electricity is the key. Now, look at this. Go on, touch it. -It feels warm. -It is. Yes. How do you do? Turn it off! -I can\\'t, it\\'s not working. -Try to stay calm, Henry. Simply a matter of reducing the polarity. A monkey\\'s arm is basically the same as ours. -No arm is this strong! -Now, this must work. Let me help you, professor. You shall, of course, tell no one. They wouldn\\'t believe you anyway. Dearest Victor. Nothing much changes here. Mrs. Moritz continues to love and torment Justine, in equal measure. Willie grows more precocious every day... ...and Father almost expires with pride... ...at the very thought of you and your work. And I.... Well, I just miss you, very much. Please write soon, Victor. No, I\\'m serious. You take vaccine, for instance. Thirty years ago the entire concept of vaccine was unheard of... ...and now we save lives every day. -But that isn\\'t the whole answer. -What do you mean? That sooner or later the best way to cheat death will be to create life. Now you\\'ve gone too far. -There\\'s only one God, Victor. -No, leave God out of it. If you loved someone, they had a sick heart... ...wouldn\\'t you give them a healthy one? It\\'s not impossible. We can do it, we\\'re steps away. If we can replace one part of a human, we can replace every part. And if we do that, we can design a life. We can create a being that will not grow old or sicken. One that\\'s stronger than us, better than us. One more intelligent than us, more civilized than us. -In our lifetime? -No. How close did you get, professor? Too close. Professor, I beg you, let me see these notes. No. My work now, and its application... ...lies exclusively in the preservation of life. I abandoned my other researches many years ago. Why? Because they resulted in abomination. You\\'re not sticking that in me. It\\'s got a pox in it, I hear. -Pox? They\\'ve given us pox? -Pox. It\\'s not pox, it\\'s a vaccine that will prevent plague in this city. -What\\'s that? -It\\'s a tiny, harmless amount... -...of anti-smallpox serum. -You just said pox! I said it was harmless. It\\'s a necessary precaution, without which this godforsaken city... ...would be immediately put under quarantine. You doctors kill. I don\\'t care what you say. You\\'re not sticking that in me. Yes, I am. It\\'s the law! -Sit him down, someone. -You\\'re not sticking that in me! You\\'re not sticking that in me! -Sir? -Professor? Sir? Find him! Come on! Come on! Come on! It\\'s no use, Victor, he\\'s gone. -No! No, Henry! -Let him go! -No! No, this shouldn\\'t happen! -Let him go! Victor, stop! -It shouldn\\'t happen! -Stop! It need not happen! The hell with you! Whatever you say, whatever you call it, you doctors are killers. You murder people! Evil! You\\'re evil! Evil! You\\'re the ones that deserve to die. God will punish you. He\\'ll punish you! God will punish you! My God, you were so close! Of course, the power! The materials were wrong. You needed auxiliary sources. \"The experiment a failure. Resulting reanimant malformed and hideous to behold. This factor dependant on the appropriate raw materials.\" Raw materials.... -Come on, Henry. -I can\\'t help you, Victor. -You won\\'t. What are you afraid of? -Everything! What if the authorities--? We\\'ll do this in secret. I\\'ve got the raw materials, I\\'ve got Waldman\\'s journals. -You stole his journals? -We owe it to him to complete this. -He was one step away. -He never wanted this. Couldn\\'t face it, that\\'s different. Even if it were possible, and even if you had the right-- Which you don\\'t. --to make this decision for us... ...can you imagine there wouldn\\'t be a terrible price to pay? I think for the chance to defeat death and disease... ...to let everyone on Earth have the chance at life... ...sustained, healthy life... ...to allow people who love each other to be together forever.... For all of that, I think it\\'s a risk worth taking. Please, Justine, just leave me alone. I won\\'t talk about it. But all these letters, you read them to us every week. I wrote them. I wrote the letters. He hasn\\'t written to me in months. Elizabeth.... Something horrific is happening to him. I can feel it. At first I wasn\\'t sure, but I knew I had to hide it from Father. Now there are rumors of cholera. I can look after Father and Willie. You go to Ingolstadt-- That\\'s not possible. He won\\'t want me. He\\'s probably found someone else. If he was mine, I would have gone already. But he isn\\'t mine. He\\'s yours, and you must go to him. Raw materials, that\\'s all they are. Tissue to be re-used. The very finest brain. -But they all died of cholera, sir. -No matter. Thank you. The assembled organs must have the appropriate nutrients and heat... ...and crucially, more direct power. More direct power. Amniotic fluid is the chief biogenic element. The subject is injected with this. The copper acupuncture needles... ...are inserted at key energy points. Now, after the removal of current, the dead toad should retain animation. But independently of external power sources. Yes. That\\'s it. That\\'s the combination. That\\'s the combination! That\\'s it! Victor? Victor! Victor, open the door! -Victor, please! -What do you want? There\\'s cholera. It\\'s an epidemic! The city\\'s been placed under martial law. -Are you listening to me, Victor? -Yes. And? The militia\\'s arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can. Krempe knows you\\'re here. What if he tells the authorities? Goodbye, Henry. Victor, it\\'s me. Elizabeth. Can you hear me? Victor, I have to see you. -Go away. -Please, Victor! I won\\'t leave here until you see me. Come in the side door. Alone! What\\'s happened to you? How can you live here like this? And that stench. Don\\'t go in there! -We have to leave. It isn\\'t safe. -No, I have to stay. -Even if it means you\\'ll die? -Yes. Well, let me help you. No, that\\'s impossible. We made a promise. Victor, I beg you. Look, I know that this is difficult for you to understand... ...but I cannot abandon this work now. It is too important. Not just for me, but, believe me, for everyone. And it must come first. Before us? Elizabeth... ...I love you so much, but.... Goodbye. Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Oh, God! Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Live! Live! Live! Live! Yes! No.... No! No! No! No! It\\'s alive. It\\'s alive. No. What have I done? What have I done? \"Massive birth defects. Greatly enhanced physical strength. But resulting reanimant... ...is malfunctional... ...and pitiful... ...and dead.\" Tomorrow this journal and its secrets must be destroyed... ...forever. Oh, God. No! You fool, Victor Frankenstein of Geneva. How could you know what you\\'d unleashed? How is it pieced together? Bits of thieves, bits of murderers.... Evil stitched to evil stitched to evil. Do you really believe this thing will thank you for its monstrous birth? Evil will have its revenge. God help your loved ones. What do you think you\\'re doing? He\\'s got cholera! He\\'s the one who\\'s been spreading the plague! Get him! Come here, you-- Keep away from him. No, kill him now! He went this way. There now. Easy. Easy. Just a bit. -That\\'s it. There, now, rest easy. -Henry, you\\'re here. Of course I\\'m here. It was touch and go with you, though. I feared cholera, turned out to be pneumonia. Yes, I\\'m becoming something of a doctor. Even Krempe seems pleased with me. At this rate, I might even pass Anatomy. -The epidemic? -Dreadful. There\\'s nothing we can do for them. The vulnerable, anyone who\\'s without shelter or food... ...the newborns, especially, will die. -Are you sure? -I\\'m certain of it. Thank God. What do you mean? Nothing. Well then, that\\'s my shift finished. I\\'ll see you later. Elizabeth. Elizabeth. -Please, please, forgive me! -Of course I do. Victor, I don\\'t know what you\\'re working on, and I don\\'t want to know. But it nearly killed you. It\\'s over, it\\'s finished. It should never have started. It\\'s dead! It\\'s dead. -Felix! -Yes? Don\\'t forget the onion scraps. All right, I\\'ve got them. Go on, get. Come on. Come on. Go on, go on. Go on. Get. -How are the pigs? -Happy they\\'ve been fed. -How are your hands? -They\\'re bleeding again. Let me see them. That\\'s better. There. -The soup\\'s ready. -Come on, Grandpa. Sit down. Thank you. We\\'ll never get through the winter with this yield. -The ground\\'s frozen hard. -We\\'ll sell another pig at market. We can\\'t. Not until they lift the quarantine. Even then, it\\'s one less for us. Last month\\'s rent, he\\'ll be back for that. Come on. We\\'ll do this together. You\\'re right. We\\'ve got to, before the snow comes. Come on, then. The ground\\'s frozen solid. We\\'d need 20 men to do this. It\\'s useless! -It\\'s getting late. -We don\\'t have enough to eat. We\\'ll manage. Let\\'s go. Look. Look. They must be gifts from the Good Spirit of the Forest. Father, nothing in this life comes free of cost. -I would like to know who and why. -Was it the Good Spirit, Grandpa? -I believe it was. -Don\\'t fill their head with nonsense. Who\\'s there? Felix? Children? Right. What\\'s this one? -Friend? -Friend! Well done! That\\'s very good. You\\'ve got lots of friends, haven\\'t you? Grandpa and.... Friend.... Friend.... Friend. Friend. Family. Father. You must travel with them for the entire journey. This equipment must not be left unattended. My father will take delivery of them in Geneva. Understand? I do, sir. -Going somewhere? -Henry, look. Look at this locket Victor gave me. Isn’t it beautiful? -Yes, it\\'s lovely. Is this really you? -Yes, it\\'s a bad likeness, I know. But for now, it will serve instead of a ring. Congratulations on the entirely expected! -When? -As soon as we get home. We\\'ll be there for New Year\\'s Eve. -He\\'s taking over Father\\'s practice. -And expanding it. I\\'m going on ahead now the quarantine\\'s lifted. So much to do. Now, the practice needs a partner. Now, there\\'s not much money... ...but there is food and board and some very good company. And it\\'s the ideal position for someone who has finally passed Anatomy. So we were wondering if... ...there was anybody that you could recommend? Victor, I-- I don\\'t know what to say. Well, please say yes. -Yes. -Yes! -Yes! -Yes, yes! And you can write that down in your journal! \"This is... ...the journal... ...of... ...Victor... ...Frankenstein... ...of... ...Geneva.\" Come on, quickly. Come on, then, off you go. Quickly, now. -Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. Come on, now. Come on. Time for bed. In you go. \"For the Good Spirit of the Forest.\" Are you the Good Spirit of the Forest? Not exactly. Where\\'s your father? I said, where\\'s your father? Who\\'s there? Maggie? -No. -Oh, it\\'s you. -What have you done to Maggie? -Is he in there? Hiding behind a blind old man? Get away! Get away! Don\\'t blame me. Blame your son for not paying his rent on time. My God. Thank you, my friend. Thank you so much. Won\\'t you come and sit by the fire? Please, don\\'t be afraid. Come. Come in. Have a rest, sit down. That\\'s better. I\\'m glad you finally came in. A man shouldn\\'t have to hide in the shadows. Better that way, for me. Why? People are afraid. Except you. It can\\'t be as bad as that. Worse. I can \"see\" you with my hands, if you\\'ll trust me. -Papa, Papa, he hurt Grandpa! -Who hurt Grandpa? -What was that noise? -Tell me what the noise was. What happened, Maggie? Poor man. Have you no friends? There are some people. But they don\\'t know me. Why do you not go to them? Because I am so very... ...ugly. And they are so very... ...beautiful. Father! Get out of here! -Get out of here, monster. -Leave him alone! We have to leave here. No. I will have revenge! Frankenstein! Geneva. -Quickly, quickly. -She\\'s here, she\\'s here! -Willie! -We got your letter! It\\'s the first one I was allowed to read. Congratulations, Elizabeth. -I\\'m happy for you. -Thank you, Justine. Oh, is that the locket? Look how handsome Victor is. -Can I take this to show Peter? -Yes, but, Willie, it\\'s not a toy. Let him go. Don\\'t dawdle, William! Justine, you idiot. Pay attention. Anyone would think you\\'re the one that\\'s getting married. -Yes, Mother. -What\\'s wrong? Nothing. Really. Just leave it. You\\'ve ruined it now. No! No! Frankenstein. You, with me. -Have you seen Willie? -Isn’t he back yet? Claude went to find if he\\'d lost track of time. -They say he never arrived. -Far too late for him to still be out. -William! -William! -William! -William! Willie! Willie! Willie.... Willie! This isn\\'t a game! Willie! It\\'s so late. We\\'re all so tired. I\\'m so tired. Father! I\\'m so pleased to see you. What\\'s wrong? William! We checked the east ridge. There\\'s nothing there. Damn! Elizabeth? I found him! I found him! Elizabeth! No! We did everything we could, sir. You just rest easy now. We did everything we could. Sir, I\\'m terrified for my girl. She\\'s still out looking for William. We parted badly. I was cruel to her. I didn\\'t mean it. I think she finds it hard, with your wedding. She loves you dearly. I couldn\\'t bear it if anything happened to her. She\\'s all I\\'ve got. Please, help me! We\\'ll organize another search now that it\\'s light. We will find her, Mrs. Moritz, I promise. -How is Father? -His heart is breaking. Mr. Frankenstein... ...we\\'ve apprehended the murderer, five miles from here hiding in a barn. We found this on her. It\\'s yours, I believe, sir? Sir, you must come immediately. The townspeople have gone mad. -What are they doing? -They must have broken into the jail! For God\\'s sake, can\\'t you stop them? They\\'ve gone wild! This is a lynching mob! Stop! This is unlawful. -Justine. -Justine! Victor! Help me! I was trying to find him! I went to the lake, but it was dark! I wanted to bring him to you! He must be there for the wedding! I\\'m sorry! He\\'s so tiny. We managed to close the gates on the mob, Claude. What about Justine? We\\'ve cut her down. We can bury her in the morning. Thank you, Claude. Get to bed. The sea of ice. I will meet you there... ...on the sea of ice. Oh, Justine, forgive me. Victor, tell me. Who is this man? How do you know he\\'s responsible? I\\'ll tell you everything after I destroy him. This is a matter for the police. They wouldn\\'t understand. Well, neither do I. Then just accept it. Get up. Get up. You do speak. Yes, I speak. And read. And think. And know the ways of man. How did you find me? Your journal. Then you mean to kill me. No. You murdered my brother, didn\\'t you? I took him by the throat with one hand... ...lifted him off the ground... ...and slowly crushed his neck. And as I killed him, I saw your face. You gave me these emotions. But you didn\\'t tell me how to use them. Now two people are dead... ...because of us. Why? There\\'s something at work in my soul which I do not understand. What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out? Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people? -Materials, nothing more. -You\\'re wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this? In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart? And reading and speaking. Not things learned, so much as things remembered. Trace memories in the brain, perhaps. Did you ever consider the consequences of your actions? You gave me life, and then you left me to die. Who am I? You.... I don\\'t know. And you think I\\'m evil. What can I do? There is something I want. A friend. A friend? Companion. A female. Someone like me. So she won\\'t hate me. Like you? Oh, God, you don\\'t know what you\\'re asking. I do know that... ...for the sympathy of one living being... ...I would make peace with all. I have love in me the likes of which... ...you can scarcely imagine. And rage, the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one... ...I will indulge the other. And if I consent, how will you live? We would travel north, my bride and I... ...to the furthest reaches of the Pole. Where no man has ever set foot. There, we would live out our lives... ...together. No human eye would ever see us again. This, I vow. You must help me. Please. If it is possible to right this wrong... ...then I will do it. -Victor! -Victor. Are you all right? -Yes, I\\'m safe. I\\'m safe. -What happened? Tell us. Victor. Victor, you have to tell us what happened! One month, that\\'s all I ask. And then we can be married and we can forget this whole business. -I promise. -Promise? Promise. Oh, don\\'t dare use that word to me. You promised to tell me who this man was. You promised to stop this work. -Your promises mean nothing. -Elizabeth. -I have to leave this house. -Where will you go? -Somewhere I can recover. -This is ridiculous. I haven\\'t got time to argue. Oh, isn\\'t it convenient? Or doesn\\'t it fit in with your plans? Don\\'t you ever think of anyone or anything but yourself? God forgive me. Why her? Materials, remember? Nothing more. -Your words. -No. You will honor your promise to me! I will not. Go on, kill me now. That is mild compared to what will come. If you deny me my wedding night, I will be with you on yours. Elizabeth! Elizabeth. Wait. Wait, please wait. Please. I have to speak to you. Please! What do you want to say? Don\\'t go. Please, don\\'t go. I\\'m frightened. Of what? I have done something so terrible... ...so evil. And I\\'m frightened that if I tell you the truth... ...that I will lose you. You\\'ll lose me if you don\\'t. I... ...don\\'t know... ...what... ...to do. Will you marry me, Victor? Marry me today. Tomorrow, tell me everything. But you must tell me the truth. And together, we can face anything. Whatever you\\'ve done, whatever has happened... ...I love you. To share the truth, the whole truth, for good or ill... ...to stand by each other in sickness and in health... ...and in joy, from this day forward... ...till death do you part. Who is this man, sir? -How shall we know him? -Believe me, you\\'ll know him. He killed Master William, and Justine Moritz died for it. No hesitation, lads. Shoot the bastard on sight! Henry? Don\\'t worry about a thing. You two look after each other. I\\'ll look after your father. I\\'m sorry, sir. The last ferry\\'s gone. There\\'s nothing now till morning. -Damn. -I\\'ll secure you lodgings for the night. -Thank you, Claude. -Come on. -Keep your pistols dry! -They\\'re dry enough. And if they fail, we\\'ve others. And if those fail... ...we can always gut the bastard. -Go to your post. -Yes, sir. Don\\'t worry, sir. You\\'re well guarded. Now, why don\\'t you go on upstairs to your wife? It\\'s not often a man has his wedding night. You\\'re soaking. Brother and sister no more. Now husband and wife. Victor? Lock the door. -Lock the door. -Victor. I saw him in a flash of lightning. He ran to the lake. You two stay here. We lost him. Elizabeth! Don\\'t bother to scream. Please.... Please don\\'t hurt me. You are lovelier than I ever could have imagined. Elizabeth! Elizabeth! I keep my promises! For God\\'s sake, tell me what happened. No point. I know what I have to do. God. No, Victor! You can\\'t do this, I won\\'t let you! She\\'s gone. I love her. What would you do? Leave her in peace. My father would have done this for my mother. Your father\\'s dead. Then there\\'s nothing left to lose. Nothing but your soul. Live! No! Live. Live. Yes. Yes. Yes. Say my name. Please, say my name. Remember! You must remember. Elizabeth? Elizabeth? That\\'s it. That\\'s it, you remember. That\\'s it. Now, stand. Stand. Yes. Yes. Yes. You remember. You remember. She\\'s beautiful. She\\'s not for you. Come. Elizabeth? Say my name. Elizabeth. Yes. Elizabeth! You\\'re beautiful. Say my name. Elizabeth, come to me. Come to me. Say my name, Elizabeth. Vic.... That\\'s right, Elizabeth. Victor. No, you\\'re mine. You\\'re mine. -Leave her alone! No! -Get away from her. She\\'s mine. She\\'s mine! She said my name! She remembers! She\\'s mine! No! All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave... ...by my hand. I followed the trail he left for me-- North. Always north. --for months now... ...with one intent: To kill him. Now... ...I\\'m tired. I\\'m so very, very tired. What did he say? He\\'s dead. He died raving about some phantom. What is it out there, captain? He told me a story that... ...couldn\\'t be true. He was mad, I think. A warming breeze. -The ice will melt yet. -And what then, captain? -We head north. -No. Who are you? He never gave me a name. Why do you weep? He was my father. \"And yea, I gave my heart to know wisdom... ...and to know madness and folly... ...and I perceived that all is vanity and vexation of spirit. For in much wisdom is much grief... ...and he that increaseth knowledge, increaseth sorrow. For God shall bring every work and every secret thing into judgment... ...whether it be good, or whether it be evil.\" -Captain-- -He has a right to bear witness. Jesus, it\\'s breaking up! Get back to the ship, captain. Leave the damn torch! Leave it! Come with us. I am done with man. Hang on, I\\'ve got you! Help! Help! Here, captain. Here, captain. Quick, grab my hand! Where to now, captain?'\n",

      " 'Nine Films &amp; Television Pty Limited v Ninox Television Limited [2006] FCA 1046 (11 August 2006)http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2006/1046.htmlapplication for costs to be fixed rather than taxedrespondents applied for ajournment at hearingdismissedrespondents had notice of amount claimed for four months prior to hearingdiscretion of court to award lump sumrelevant factors to considerprinciples to be applied in fixing quantum of lump sum.costs  1 The applicants seek an order that the costs of the primary Application and Cross-Claim, payable by Ninox and Mr McEwen pursuant to orders made on 30 September 2005, be fixed under 0 62 r 4(2)(c) of the Federal Court Rules at a total sum of $843,199.42 instead of being taxed.2 The rule provides that where a person is ordered to pay costs as taxed, the Court has a discretion, which must be exercised judicially, to order a gross amount instead of an amount determined after taxation.3 This judicial discretion is broad and unfettered by any specified considerations.Taxation of costs in a case such as the one before me is a lengthy, expensive and time-consuming process.The rule is directed to the avoidance of such expense, delay and protraction of litigation, and it may be appropriate to apply the rule in either a complex case or simple one: see Beach Petroleum NL Johnson (1995) 57 FCR 119 at 120.4 When the application came on for hearing before me, Counsel for the respondents sought an adjournment.I refused that application because the respondents had been on notice of the amount claimed for over four months and had been served approximately five weeks before the hearing with an expert assessment from a costs consultant, Ms Suzanne Bevacqua, setting out the details of the amount claimed to support the lump sum order.Although not in taxable form, the detailed breakdown is comprehensive and extends over some forty-eight pages together with a Report of fifteen pages (\"the expert Report\") that sets out the reasoning behind the assessment.In my view, this estimate and outline of the approach adopted by the applicants gave sufficient information to enable the respondents to properly prepare and challenge the claim.Instead of challenging the claim in respect of specific items, the respondents served two affidavits on the applicants one day before the matter was due to be heard.At the hearing, the respondents sought to base an application for adjournment on the information contained in these affidavits.Neither of these challenged any specific item or group of items.One affidavit, prepared by Ms Deborah Vine-Hall, was filed on 2 August 2006.Another affidavit prepared by Mr John McEwen was handed up to me at the hearing as it had not been filed as at that date.Ms Vine-Hall is an experienced costs expert and carried out an examination of Nine\\'s material and the expert Report, but in her affidavit there is no indication of any specific objection to any item or line of reasoning in these documents.Having regard to the protracted history of this matter and the failure of the respondents to provide any satisfactory explanation as to why the hearing should not proceed, I refused the adjournment.There was no cross-examination of any of the deponents to any of the affidavits filed by Nine on this costs application.5 The first question is whether it is appropriate, in the circumstances of this case, to fix a lump sum instead of permitting the matter to proceed to taxation.The answer must be in the affirmative.This litigation was hard fought and had a lengthy history with numerous interlocutory applications concerning service outside the jurisdiction, a security for costs application, discovery, setting aside of subpoenas and adjournment of the proceedings.The estimate prepared by the costs assessor for Nine is detailed and lengthy, and its preparation has clearly involved the investigation of individual items.A bill in taxable form would also involve extensive and detailed preparation.6 Evidence indicates that it is likely that the taxation procedure would take at least several weeks to complete with extensive additional work by legal advisors.The fees of the applicant\\'s cost consultant alone in preparing a detailed bill of costs is estimated to be in the order of $40,000, without taking into account the costs of any appearances and the preparation costs required for counsel and solicitors on the taxation.In addition, there is a real concern and some evidence to suggest that the respondents may not be in a position to meet the costs order.Delay would only aggravate this concern.In the light of these considerations, it appears to me that this is clearly a case where it is appropriate to make an order that the whole of the costs should be fixed as a gross sum without taxation.7 The second question concerns quantum.Nine says that the starting point in considering this question is that the costs as between solicitor and client are said to amount to $965,671.47.The amount claimed by Nine represents approximately 87 percent of this figure.The figure estimated by the cost assessor as reasonable for both the Cross-Claim and the hearing at first instance is $843,199.42, which comprises solicitors\\' profit costs of $482,046.81 and disbursements of $365,691.61 less work done for taxation in an amount of $4,539.00.This is said to be a proper and necessary figure for Nine to recover on a party-party basis.It is evident from the report of Nine\\'s costs consultant that the matter was approached on the basis that the charges were necessary given the extreme importance and significance of the proceedings, together with the range of complex issues involved.8 In fixing a lump sum, the exercise is one of estimation or assessment and not of arithmetic calculation or precision.As pointed out in Harrison v Schipp [2002] NSWCA 213 ; (2002) 54 NSWLR 738 at [22] , the rule contemplates the application of a much broader brush than that applied on taxation.The approach must be logical, fair and reasonable, and should only be exercised when the Court considers that it can do so fairly as between the parties: see also Jacobson J\\'s discussion in Sony Entertainment (Australia) Ltd v Smith (2005) 215 ALR 788 at [198]-[199].In that case, his Honour allowed the applicants to recover only 40 percent of the amount claimed.Counsel for Nine points out that in Sony, his Honour did not have the advantage of a detailed assessment of costs by an expert consultant as in the present case.However, I note that the amount sought by the applicants in Sony as a gross sum was only 60 percent of the actual costs incurred.His Honour reduced that claim by a further 20 percent.Although the circumstances in the present case differ from the circumstances presented in the Sony matter, I consider that the approach of Jacobson J affords a broad general pointer to an appropriate range when determining a gross sum.In Donohoe v Britz (No.2) [1904] HCA 25 ; (1904) 1 CLR 662 at 666, Barton J pointed out that when considering the amount of costs to be awarded as between party and party, the luxuries of litigation must be paid for by those who indulge in them and only the necessary costs are to be paid for by the losing side.The principles and approaches are also set out and considered by von Doussa J in Sparnon &amp; Ors v Apand Pty Ltd [1998] FCA 164 in which his Honour fixed a gross amount of $634, 320.54 where the actual costs paid by the client totalled $1,040,135.80.This amounted to a discount of some 39 percent.9 I have case-managed this matter since its inception, and I am aware of the events and applications prior to the hearing as well as the conduct of the hearing itself.The case was in substance simple but involved a detailed comparison of a number of television series each involving some degree of home renovation.The case called for the application of settled legal principles, and resolution of the matter was to a considerable extent one of impression.The case was very hard fought and no doubt, Nine perceived it to be extremely significant and important.But I do not agree that objectively the case had any outstanding or particular degree of complexity or significance in a legal or factual sense.The actual hearing before me took place over only four days and there were detailed submissions made in writing.It is apparent that the amount now claimed is a very high percentage of the solicitor-client costs, and it appears to me that some substantial allowance must be made for challenges to the items referred to in the expert Report and detailed in the schedule compiled by Nine\\'s costs consultant.The cost consultant agrees that the rates charged by senior counsel were higher than the range published by the National Guide to Counsel Fees effective 1 January 2005 , but says that there has been some moderation of the rates and also that regard ought to be had to the context of the current market for legal services.I agree that this is the correct approach, but nevertheless I consider that bearing the market in mind, the total amount sought is in excess of that which is necessary and appropriate.10 In all the circumstances, and having regard to the history of this matter, the relative simplicity of the issues, the limited duration of the hearing, the individual items described and the evidence of a costs consultant, I consider that an appropriate and reasonable figure which is in the interests of both parties is an amount of $650,000.I therefore fix the amount recoverable pursuant to O 62 r 4(2)(c) in the amount of $650,000, which is approximately 77.1 percent of the total amount claimed by way of estimate.11 This figure should be apportioned in respect of the first and third respondents\\' liability under Orders 4 and 5 made on 30 September 2005 that are now in force.In apportioning the amount of $650,000 as between Orders 4 and 5, I note that at [29] of the expert Report, Ms Bevacqua has estimated that 75 percent of the costs should be apportioned in favour of the Application, leaving 25 percent of the costs allocated to the Cross-Claim.I have used these relative percentages in apportioning the total amount of $650,000.Of the total amount, the costs payable by the first and third respondents pursuant to Order 4 made 30 September 2005 are fixed at a gross sum of $487,500.The costs payable by the first respondent pursuant to Order 5 made 30 September are fixed at a gross sum of $162,500.12 The amount of $100,000, and such interest as has accrued on that sum, which is held in the joint bank account of Dale Francis Cliff and Michael John Williams pursuant to the order made by the Court on 7 June 2005, is to be released to the applicants for the purpose of payment of Nine\\'s costs.13 I also order that pursuant to O 62 r 26 of the Federal Court Rules , the applicants have leave to discontinue the proceedings insofar as it relates to the applicants\\' claims for pecuniary relief, with no further or other orders as to costs.14 The respondents are to pay the costs of this application.

[T]he appropriate intention to impute to the parties here is that Harold and Saul were to be at liberty to use the name in the City restaurant as long as they wanted to; that is to say, the use was not conditional on a continuation of the business relationship between the two restaurants.... [T]he licence was not terminable at will, ... but was for the life of the City restaurant.... 7 Earlier, at Miller 158 FCR 1 [79] Sundberg J noted: The fact that no restrictions were placed by Lionel and Joel upon Harold and Saul\\'s use of the name merely means that they were at liberty to use it, unconditionally, in the City restaurant for as long as they wished.It indicates the amplitude of the agreement that was undoubtedly made, but provides no occasion for expanding it.8 Initially in the first action, Harold and Saul had not made any claim for relief in relation to a licence to use the mark.But, in his closing submissions counsel applied for leave to amend the originating application to add to the prayer for relief a declaration that Harold and Saul \"are entitled to operate the City restaurant under the name Squires Loft\".The amendment was allowed and the declaration was made in the terms sought.Neither Lionel and Joel, nor their company JLCS, made any submission on the form the declaration should take.9 The evidence at the first trial was that Harold and Saul operated the City restaurant through their company, SLCS.This was mentioned in the reasons for judgment on several occasions.For example when recording a number of matters that were not in dispute between the parties Sundberg J said that one of those things was \"that the City restaurant was, through their company, Harold and Saul\\'s: Miller 158 FCR 1 [42].10 When SLCS was set up with Harold and Saul as its directors and shareholders, they did not intend for the company to be the beneficial owner of the business.SLCS was appointed as the trustee of the Squires Loft City Steakhouse Unit Trust and the City restaurant was the unit trust\\'s principal asset.The trust had 120 units on issue.Harold and Saul each held 40 units and their wives, Doreen and Rozanne, held 20 units each.11 The existence of the trust and the identity of its unit holders did not come out at the first trial, no doubt because those facts were irrelevant to any issue that had to be decided in that case.Nonetheless, that SLCS owned the City restaurant in its capacity as trustee would have come as no surprise to Joel.When SLCS was incorporated Joel suggested to Harold and Saul that they use a structure similar to that employed by Lionel and Joel in relation to the South Yarra restaurant.That business is beneficially owned by a unit trust in which Lionel, Joel and their respective families are the unit holders.12 Now I can explain what has caused the current dispute.It arises out of a change in the ownership of the shares in SLCS and the units in the unit trust.In November 2007 there were several important changes made.Harold ceased to be a director of SLCS and Edwin Daniels was appointed in his place.Saul and Harold transferred their shares in SLCS to Webstir Pty Ltd, in its capacity as trustee of the Saul Miller Family Trust.Two new shares in SLCS were issued to Webstir.Four more new shares in SLCS were issued to Danfam Holdings Pty Ltd as trustee for the Daniels Family Trust.Four new shares in SLCS were issued to Silverside Investment Holdings Limited, two in its capacity as trustee for the Janar Trust and two in its capacity as trustee for the Krugersdrop Trust.Saul transferred his 40 units in the unit trust to Webstir.Harold transferred his 40 units to Danfam.Doreen and Rozanne transferred their units to Silverside.As a result of those transactions Saul (through the Saul Miller Family Trust) now holds one third of the shares in SLCS and one third of the units in the unit trust.The remaining shares and units are owned by Danfam and Silverside on the trusts I have mentioned.The principal beneficiary of each trust is related to Saul, in one case the person is a cousin and the other a partner of a cousin.13 It is not in dispute that, notwithstanding the changes in ownership of the shares and units, there has been no change in the management of the City restaurant business.Since its inception the City restaurant has been run by Harold and Saul jointly, apart from a period between June 2002 and September 2004 when Saul did not work at the restaurant.During that period it was run by Harold.When I say that Harold and Saul run the business I mean that they manage the day to day operations of the City restaurant, make decisions about the purchase of stock, manage the staff, decide all matters about marketing, advertising and so forth.Importantly, the uncontested evidence is that neither the new director (Daniels) nor any representative of the new unit holders has any say in the running of the business.14 The principal issue in contest is whether the licence granted to Harold and Saul and recorded in the declaration is still in existence.In terms, JLCS seeks a declaration that the licence \"is no longer valid\".I take this to mean that the term of the licence has come to an end.The contention put by JLCS is that the licence \"is no longer valid\" because of the change in the ownership of the shares in SLCS and the units in the unit trust.The proposition that lies behind this contention is that the licence was to operate for only so long as Harold and Saul owned the City restaurant through SLCS.Moreover, it is submitted that this is how the declaration should be understood.Put another way, the submission is that Sundberg J intended by his declaration to confine the licence to the period that Harold and Saul either personally or through SLCS owned the City restaurant business.15 Although a good deal of argument was devoted to the meaning and effect of the declaration it is, in my opinion, quite clear that Harold and Saul\\'s declared right is not in any way dependent upon them being shareholders in SLCS or unit holders in the unit trust.This is so for several reasons.The first and most obvious is that the declaration makes no mention of SLCS.The second and equally important reason is that according to its terms the declaration is not concerned with the ownership of the City restaurant.The right it records is a right to \"operate\" the restaurant using the Squires Loft mark.The \"operation\" of a restaurant is something different from its ownership.Next there is Sundberg J\\'s finding at Miller 158 FCR 1 [79] that the licence is unconditional.That is to say the right to \"operate\" the City restaurant using the mark is unlimited, and runs until the death of the survivor of Harold and Saul.This finding is inconsistent with the supposed limitation.16 In anticipation of not being able to mount a convincing argument about the meaning of the declaration, JLCS sought an order that I vary the declaration to read: \"Squires Loft City Steakhouse Pty Ltd is entitled to use the Squires Loft name in the operation of the restaurant known as Squires Loft City Steakhouse, situated at 12 Goldie Place in Melbourne, for so long as Harold Miller and Saul Miller are its sole directors and shareholders\".17 It was accepted that, in appropriate circumstances, a declaration (as any other order) may be amended by the trial judge or, in his absence, by another first instance judge.The cases say that, apart from the need to correct error or make a supplementary order, an order may be amended to give effect to the intention of the judge or to record accurately what the judge had decided.18 The argument here is that Sundberg J knew that SLCS was owned and, through their directorships, controlled by Harold and Saul and that SLCS owned the business.Accordingly, it is submitted that Sundberg J must have had in mind that Lionel and Joel had given their consent to Harold and Saul\\'s use of the mark \"so long as the [C]ity restaurant was operated by Harold and Saul ... albeit through [SLCS], a company which they jointly controlled and jointly owned\".19 There is simply no substance to this argument.First of all, there is nothing in his reasons, or in his findings, to suggest that Sundberg J intended that the licence be subject to a condition relating to ownership.The opposite is the case, in my opinion.I have already cited from the reasons where the judge said that there were no restrictions placed by Lionel and Joel upon Harold and Saul\\'s use of the name.This was one of the bases upon which the judge found that the licence was unconditional and that Harold and Saul could use the name in the City restaurant for as long as they wished.20 Toward the end of the trial in a last ditch attempt to keep the argument alive JLCS sought leave to add to the relief it seeks in this action a declaration that the consent to use the mark granted to Harold and Saul is no longer effective because that consent lasted \"for as long as Harold and Saul jointly owned and operated the [C]ity restaurant through [SLCS]\".21 I will not allow the amendment.Quite apart from the fact that it seeks to impose a condition upon a licence that Sundberg J found to be unconditional, it is far too late in the day (as well as impermissible in point of law) to contend for the existence of a conditional licence when the nature of that licence has been settled in another action.22 This bring me to the cross claim that has been brought by SLCS, Harold and Saul.The reason for the cross claim is that JLCS has granted permission to a new steakhouse, located in Little Lonsdale Street, Melbourne, a distance of less than 500 metres from the City restaurant, to use the Squires Loft name.The restaurant, which is known to as the City Grill Room, first opened in October 2007.Initially it used only the words City Grill Room in its name.In mid December 2007, however, JLCS gave permission to the City Grill Room to use the words Squires Loft in conjunction with its name.According to Joel the change was to \"help market\" the store.Thus, since December 2007 the City Grill Room has traded under the name Squires Loft City Grill Room.23 Harold and Saul argue that the City restaurant has an established reputation by reference to the \"Squires Loft\" mark and patrons will be confused when they see another steak restaurant operating close by that uses the same name.There is ample evidence that the City restaurant has a reputation by reference to the \"Squires Loft\" mark.That reputation has come about by word of mouth, through the publication of promotional material at a cost of approximately $20,000 per annum, and by the City restaurant\\'s involvement in various trade organisations.Lionel himself conceded \"the name Squires Loft is known to represent the Goldie Place restaurant\".24 Notwithstanding his acceptance that the City restaurant has a reputation by reference to the words Squires Loft, Lionel denies there is confusion between the City restaurant and the Squires Loft City Grill Room.Lionel acknowledged that there is some confusion between the South Yarra business and the City restaurant because each uses the same name.But he was not prepared to accept the possibility of similar confusion between the City restaurant and the City Grill Room.His explanation was that the two names (viz Squires Loft City steakhouse Squires Loft City Grill Room) are sufficiently different that there could be no confusion.25 I do not think Lionel can be taken seriously when he gave this evidence.In my view there is a real likelihood of confusion, by patrons believing that one establishment is the other, with the two restaurants operating in such close proximity and using what is substantially the same name.Indeed, there is evidence of this confusion.Patrons often came to the City restaurant claiming to have made a prior booking and it turns out there is no record of any booking.It is reasonable to infer those patrons have made a booking but at the other restaurant.26 The question in issue is whether this confusion gives rise to a remedy at the suit of Harold and Saul.In his evidence Lionel acknowledged that when the licence to use the mark was first granted its purpose was to set up Harold and Saul in a successful business.This was to produce benefits for both parties.It was therefore important, Lionel said, that nothing happen to damage the goodwill that would be generated by the City restaurant.The following exchange during Lionel\\'s cross-examination is instructive: Q: [Y]ou did not, under any circumstances, want to undermine the potential profitability of the Goldie Place restaurant?A: No.Q: And you wanted to ensure that nothing might happen which would damage the goodwill which might be generated by Goldie Place restaurant, am I right?A: Yes, you\\'re right.Q: And accordingly, there\\'s no doubt, is there, that if someone had suggested that you could open up a Squires Loft steakhouse within 100 metres of the Goldie Place restaurant you would have said, \"no that\\'s not on\", wouldn\\'t you?A: If somebody other than my father or my brother would have suggested it, then, yes, I would have said \"no, that\\'s not on\", but if it would have been under the same ownership and structure then I certainly would have considered it, yes.Q: But you certainly would not have considered allowing anyone not connected with your father and brother to open such a restaurant within 100 metres of the Goldie Place restaurant, would you?A: Probably not.Q: Yes.And indeed you wouldn\\'t have contemplated such a thing happening within a kilometre of the Goldie Place restaurant?A: Well I don\\'t know if I would go as far as a kilometre.Q: Is the answer \"yes\" or \"no\"?A: The answer is \"no\".Yes.27 There is additional evidence which suggests that consideration was being given to the grant of an exclusive zone to protect the City restaurant.A draft licence agreement had been prepared for execution by the parties.The draft made provision for Harold and Saul to have an exclusive area in which Lionel and Joel would not grant any other party a licence to use the mark.The typed version of the draft did not specify the area of exclusivity.Lionel had, however, noted the area in manuscript as \"two kilometres as the crow flies\".28 As to the reasonableness of an exclusive area of trade, reference might be made to discussions in 2002 between Lionel and Joel and two of their employees who wanted to open a Squires Loft restaurant in the city.Lionel and Joel indicated that the employee could have an exclusive zone of four city blocks.Lionel was asked whether this was an appropriate term to agree to as at June 1997.He said: \"In broad terms, I do agree\".He was also asked: \"And even more appropriate that any restaurant should not bear the name Squires Loft; do you agree?\" He replied: \"Well, again, if it was under common ownership, then I think that that would be acceptable.\" He was then asked: \"In circumstances, you mean, where Harold and Saul had some interest in the new restaurant?\" He said: \"Yes.\" 29 Harold and Saul contend there is an implied term in their licence that would give them a measure of security to protect the goodwill they generate from the use of the mark.They have put forward five terms which they say should be read into their licence, some of which are clearly overlapping.The proposed terms (somewhat paraphrased) are that JLCS, Lionel and Joel will not use, or authorise or permit any other entity to use the mark \"Squires Loft\" in relation to any restaurant located either (1) in the Melbourne CBD; and or (2) within a two kilometre radius of the City restaurant; and or in such close proximity to the City restaurant that it would (3) prevent, hinder or impede Harold and Saul enjoying the full benefit and advantage conferred upon them by the licence; and or (4) tend to destroy, depreciate or devalue the goodwill of the City restaurant; and or (5) divert or result in the diversion of the custom enjoyed by the City restaurant.30 I propose to put to one side for a moment whether it is appropriate to imply one or other of those terms, for it may be that the solution to Harold and Saul\\'s problem is to be found elsewhere.There is an old principle that a grantor must not derogate from his grant: he must not seek to take away with one hand what he has given with the other.This is \"a principle which merely embodies in a legal maxim a rule of common honesty\": Harmer v Jumbil (Nigeria) Areas Ltd [1921] 1 Ch 200, 225 per Younger LJ.Sometimes it is said that the principle rests on an implied promise ( North-Eastern Railway Co v Elliott (1861) J&amp;H 145 , 153), but it is in truth an independent rule of law: Cable v Bryant [1908] 1 Ch 259.31 The rule is most usually applied to the grant of an interest in land, whether by lease or sale: Cable [1908] 1 Ch 259; Woodhouse &amp; Co Ltd v Kirkland (Derby) Ltd [1970] 1 WLR 1185.But it is not confined to dealings in land.For example, in British Leyland Motor Co Ltd v Armstrong Patents Co Ltd [1986] 1 AC 577 the rule was applied to the sale of a motor car by the manufacturer.See also Molton Builders Ltd v City of Westminster London Borough Council (1975) 30 P&amp;CR 182.32 In Johnston &amp; Sons Ltd v Holland [1988] 1 EGLR 264, 267-8 Nichols LJ said:  [T]he exercise involves identifying what obligations, if any, on the part of the grantor can fairly be regarded as necessarily implicit, having regard to the particular purpose of the transaction when considered in the light of the circumstances subsisting at the time the transaction was entered into.33 The obligation is not to be unqualified.In Harmer [1921] 1 Ch 200 at 226 Younger LJ explained that:  The obligation .... must in every case be construed fairly, even strictly, if not narrowly.It must be such as, in view of the surrounding circumstances, was within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time when the transaction was entered into, and was at that time within the grantor\\'s power to fulfil.But so limited, the obligation imposed may, I think, be infinitely varied in kind, regard being had to the paramount purpose to serve which it is imposed.34 It is, in my view, clear that JLCS is required to permit Harold and Saul to use the mark without undue interference.\"Interference\" would be \"undue\" if it diminished the value of the mark to Harold and Saul.The purpose of the grant of the licence to use the mark was to enable Harold and Saul to operate a successful business.The parties hoped that the business would be successful for their mutual benefit.Lionel quite fairly conceded that opening up a Squires Loft steakhouse next to the City restaurant would unduly interfere with the goodwill derived by Harold and Saul in the use of the name and that was something he would not do.I think that Lionel recognised that he was under an obligation not to frustrate Harold and Saul\\'s operation of their restaurant.35 To my mind, however, the obligation goes further than not opening up a Squires Loft restaurant next to the City restaurant.The obligation that falls upon JLCS is not to use, or permit the use of, the Squires Loft name in a location so proximate to the City restaurant that it would likely result in a significant adverse effect on the goodwill of Harold and Saul\\'s operation.This is not to say that JLCS is thereby prevented from using the mark, or permitting the use of the mark, anywhere in the central business district.I readily accept that the use of the mark a reasonable distance away from Goldie Place would not result in an undue interference with Harold and Saul\\'s goodwill.But a distance of less than 500 metres is too close in my opinion.36 Harold and Saul have not sought relief based on the rule that a person may not derogate from his grant.Were they to apply to amend their cross claim to include relief in that regard I would accede to the application.37 If that relief is not applied for, I would hold there to be a term of the licence that prohibits JLCS from using, or authorising or permitting any other entity to use the mark \"Squires Loft\" in relation to any steak restaurant located in such close proximity to the City restaurant that it would prevent, hinder or impede Harold and Saul from enjoying the full benefit and advantaged conferred upon them by their licence.In other words, activity that, in effect, takes away the substance of the benefit conferred by the licence is prohibited.Operating a Squires Loft restaurant within 500 metres would infringe this term.In In re Vylene Enterprises Inc 90 F 3d 1472 , 1477 (9 th Cir 1996) the Ninth Circuit held a restaurant chain franchiser had breached an implied covenant of good faith by opening a new outlet within a mile and a half of the franchisee\\'s restaurant.The court said the franchisee was \"entitled to expect that the franchiser would \\'not act to destroy the right of the franchisee to enjoy the fruits of the contract\\'.\" 38 For the purpose of implying a term I need not apply the criteria set out in BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings (1977) 180 CLR 226 at 283.Those criteria are applied when a term is to be implied in a contract that appears on its face to be complete.Here the licence is informal and obviously incomplete.In such a case a term will be implied if it \"is necessary for the reasonable or effective operation of a contract of that nature in the circumstances of the case\": Hawkins v Clayton [1988] HCA 15 ; (1988) 164 CLR 539 , 573.39 The term I would imply is no more than what is necessary to ensure that Harold and Saul are not denied the benefit of the licence.Put another way, I do think it is reasonable that Harold and Saul should face competition from JLCS, or another trader using the mark, in a similar kind of business in close proximity to their establishment.40 Mr Goldblatt submitted that in this action Harold and Saul were estopped from raising any implied term.Various grounds were put forward.One was that the issue should have been raised in the first action.I do not agree.The existence of an implied term of whatever character was simply irrelevant to any issue raised in the first action.Another reason was that issues have been determined in the first action that are inconsistent with the putative implied term.There is nothing in the point.The judge made no attempt to define the scope of the licence, save to say that, from Harold and Saul\\'s perspective, it was unconditional.In particular Sundberg J said nothing about the obligations, if any, the licence imposed upon Lionel and Joel.41 Harold and Saul and their company have a claim for false and misleading conduct.They found their claim on the reputation in the Squires Loft name.They contend that the City Grill Room by reason of its use of the same name in close proximity to the City restaurant is representing that it is the City restaurant or that it is affiliated with the City restaurant.Once the City Grill Room\\'s use of the mark in close proximity to the City restaurant\\'s business is at an end, this complaint falls away.It would otherwise have been necessary for me to consider whether, and to what extent, deception by a licensee by the use of a mark is recognised or must be provided for.42 For the foregoing reasons I would dismiss the application.On the cross-claim the cross-claimants should submit a memorandum regarding the relief they seek within 48 hours to which the cross-respondents should respond within a further 48 hours.When final orders are made they will include an order that the applicant pay the respondent\\'s costs.I certify that the preceding forty-one (41) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finkelstein.Associate:Dated: 12 June 2008 Counsel for

      " \"         tonight i went to the gym. the shirt i was wearing was given to me by kara. as i worked out, i was omitting the smell of kara's laundary detergant. it was really weird. i felt like i was bathing in someone else's scent. on a weird scale..i kinda liked it. it was nice to have a new smell. wow sometimes i amaze myself with my...i dont want to say weirdness but i'm too tired to think of another word.          i went through all of my college stuff today..and though i feel like i spent hours and hours looking at it, and i read a ton of it and even filled out (partly) an application, i still feel like i basically got nothing done. it's really irritating.                Dear Miriam,     I miss you.          So i've had this blog thing for awhile now. and i knew how to put pictures up awhile ago. but now i have no clue again. i also amaze myself with my own stupidity. i dont even know how to put a little picture thing up for my profile. maybe i shouldnt even be going to college!           i am so determined.               goodnight.          PS i tried a new font. i am cutting edge.            \"\n",
      " 'Automatic differentiation (autodiff) has revolutionized machine learning. It\\nallows expressing complex computations by composing elementary ones in creative\\nways and removes the burden of computing their derivatives by hand. More\\nrecently, differentiation of optimization problem solutions has attracted\\nwidespread attention with applications such as optimization as a layer, and in\\nbi-level problems such as hyper-parameter optimization and meta-learning.\\nHowever, the formulas for these derivatives often involve case-by-case tedious\\nmathematical derivations. In this paper, we propose a unified, efficient and\\nmodular approach for implicit differentiation of optimization problems. In our\\napproach, the user defines (in Python in the case of our implementation) a\\nfunction $F$ capturing the optimality conditions of the problem to be\\ndifferentiated. Once this is done, we leverage autodiff of $F$ and implicit\\ndifferentiation to automatically differentiate the optimization problem. Our\\napproach thus combines the benefits of implicit differentiation and autodiff.\\nIt is efficient as it can be added on top of any state-of-the-art solver and\\nmodular as the optimality condition specification is decoupled from the\\nimplicit differentiation mechanism. We show that seemingly simple principles\\nallow to recover many recently proposed implicit differentiation methods and\\ncreate new ones easily. We demonstrate the ease of formulating and solving\\nbi-level optimization problems using our framework. We also showcase an\\napplication to the sensitivity analysis of molecular dynamics.'\n",
      " 'GIRL: They\\'re fighting again! Oh, boy. Don\\'t! Wait! Not my homework! No! Stop it! No! Problem, gentlemen? Hey, dork-brain! If you weren\\'t a girl, I\\'d beat your face off. You\\'re calling me a girl? You called me one! You asked for it. Ow! Now get out of here! [BELL RINGS] Forget those guys. They\\'re jealous because you\\'re smart and funny. And girls like that. What girls? Lots of girls. I mean... I like you. I don\\'t like you. Now everybody thinks I need a girl to fight for me. You are a dork-brain. My nose! Wimp! Moe and Larry in the house. Grant, what have we got out back? All clear here, sir. Matthews, what do you got? Returnable cans, sir. I think I\\'m up to 75 cents. CLONSKY: Hey, we got a cab. Here comes Curly. Yep, the Three Stooges. CLONSKY: Check it out, lvan\\'s packing. [SPEAKING IN RUSSIAN] Thank you! We\\'ve got a briefcase. Hart, waiting for visual confirmation. No disc yet. Case is opening. This woman\\'s ass is in the way. Hart, we can\\'t see a goddamn thing. We need to see the discs. CLONSKY: This broad\\'s got two asses! MCDONALD: Hart, do something! Excuse me. You wanting something else? Yeah. You know what? I really love this borscht. Or, as they say in Russian: [SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN] - All right, Hart. We got the discs. - We\\'re moving in! FBI! Get down on the ground! Now! - Get down on the ground! - Do it! Keep your hands where I can see them! No English. [SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN] Hart! Nobody moves until I see some goddamn \"Lazhitsa na pol\"! Sir, he\\'s turning purple! Hart, until we secure, you stay. - Sir. - Hart! Sir, that is one really, really purple Russian, sir! MCDONALD: He\\'s still armed! Nobody moves! Hands up! Back off! Back off! - No, sir. He\\'s not gonna die. - Hart! He\\'s not good enough for that. His victims didn\\'t get a chance to choke on a peanut, did they, sir? Now you\\'re going down. Drop the guns or I\\'ll kill her. KRASHOW: Lvan, out the back. You\\'re not killing anyone, you peanut-eating bastard. Step back! Move it! Move it! [SHOUTS IN RUSSIAN] Party\\'s over, boys. How\\'s your head, my little piroshki? This is gonna put you away for a long time. You know that? Let\\'s get that ambulance in here! - Shut up! MCDONALD: Stay with me, all right? - I\\'m sorry. - Don\\'t be sorry. You did a great job! [SIRENS WAILING] Nice work. See you back there, okay? Come on, Hart. The van\\'s waiting. I got Grant shot. I shouldn\\'t have moved. Come on, you made a choice. It was wrong, but that\\'s it. It\\'s over. By the way, you look like hell. [HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYS] - Morning, Mrs. Schwartz. Schnatzie. - Good morning, Gracie. [PHONE RINGS] Hart. Yes, sir. ETA, 20 minutes. No problem. Breakdown? Yes, sir. Negative. Do not need assistance. Ten-four, sir. Yes, I know it\\'s hot. [SIREN WAILS] Hey, you cannot park... It\\'s an emergency. Official business. Ma\\'am, aside, please. Thank you. Official business, sir. Emergency. Step aside. Hey, get lost! I\\'m waiting here. FBI. You might want to stay out of this. Excuse me. Sir, ma\\'am, please back off. All right. I need eight double-tall... Eight double-tall lattes. One with no foam. Five decaf lattes with a long straw. Four caramel macchiattos. Double up on the cup. I got a long way to go. Two blueberry scones with the little granules on top... ...and one Starbucks compilation CD. - No! I would like... - Oh, jeez. What\\'s going on? Where\\'s McDonald? Could we put out an APB on my Frappuccino? It\\'s in the bag. Did he say anything about last night? Relax. Don\\'t annoy him. Don\\'t say anything. Don\\'t argue. I don\\'t argue. I never argue. When do I argue? I might have a heated discussion with somebody. Is this you not arguing? Because you suck at it. MCDONALD: Morning, everybody. Morning, sir. It\\'s... Sir. Okay, everybody. I know you\\'re all concerned about Grant\\'s condition. So I\\'m happy to report... ...Jerry\\'s gonna be fine. He\\'ll be out of the hospital in two weeks. He says he\\'s expecting lots of gifts. Okay, everybody. So much for the good news. We got another letter from the Citizen. Arson, explosives, poison... ...this guy never works the same way twice. The only thing we know for sure... ...is, we get these letters full of incomprehensible riddles... ...he strikes and suddenly the clues make sense. This one is down in Intelligence. Hopefully, we\\'ll get a lead before somebody gets killed. In the meantime... ...Matthews, get a team together. Sir, you want me to take point? For five years you\\'ve wanted it. Last night, you earned it. Pick your team. I want preliminaries by 3. That\\'s it. Sir...? Who\\'s buying me lunch? Sir, I would like to talk about what happened last night. I didn\\'t exactly follow orders... \"Exactly\" follow orders? There\\'s no such thing. You follow orders or you don\\'t. No arguments, sir. None whatsoever. Until the hearing, you\\'re out of the field. The hearing is totally warranted. Wouldn\\'t I be better on the Citizen case? I have a background in profiling and decoding. - No. - I could contribute. Like you contributed last night? By putting yourself and five agents in jeopardy? I\\'ll save the rest for the review board. You will bury yourself under a mountain of paperwork. Discussion is over. Mike, give me a pint. Rough day? The worst. Sure you want a whole one? Yeah. Hit me bigtime, baby. Hey, Einstein. If you figure out that Citizen letter, let me know. Congratulations on the op. It\\'s a big shot. Thanks. How are you doing? You okay? I\\'m good. You\\'re starting early today. Yeah, I\\'m gonna get chip-faced. Want to join me? I\\'d love to, but I have a pressing social engagement. Beth! Brownie meeting. - Mike, give me a beer and... - Um... Milk. Give her milk. White wine spritzer. Are most of the people in here agents? As a matter of fact, here\\'s an agent. Gracie Hart. Beth Carter. Right back to you. Beth is an undergrad at Vassar, doing a paper on law enforcement. I\\'m helping her get an inside look. I bet she\\'ll do the same for you. Gracie, I would love to get a woman\\'s point of view. You\\'re barking up the wrong tree. Right, Hart? Do all the women have to wear those really masculine shoes? I get these made special by the guy that put the tattoo on my ass. We\\'ll leave you with Ben and Jerry. Catch you later. - Nice meeting you. - You too. Hope you have a good time at the mall. Wohop is the place. Wohop is good, but if you like variety, you go to La Chinita Linda. Their rice and beans are slamming. I don\\'t want variety. I get pork fried rice every... I figured it out! I tried to create a content-based pattern... ...similar to his previous letters. But this time, he used a signifier. In this case, the word \"miss\"... ...in the subsequent letters. Will you let me finish? It\\'s the Miss United States Pageant. Yeah. Intelligence thought so too. What do we got? Miss United States from San Antonio, Texas, home of the Alamo. I forgot the Alamo. The pageant lasts three days. Preliminaries, conferences... ...the live telecast. It\\'s a logistical nightmare. Not just a babe-fest. Jesus, we\\'ve only got 48 hours. Okay, gentlemen. Where do we start? I got a cousin in Texas. You might want to call the network and pageant people. Set up a meeting. Because you\\'ll probably need their cooperation. Yeah. Yeah, I can do that. Let\\'s do that. What about jurisdiction? The Citizen has been ours from the start. You might want to call San Antonio. Grease some wheels so they like us... ...when we need manpower and tech. While I\\'m at it, let\\'s do that. Good idea. He loves to make a splash. His target will be public... ...like one of these outdoor prelims or a TV broadcast. Telecasters at the convention center. We\\'re gonna need surveillance on the interior perimeter. We\\'ll need more. There\\'s a million places... ...only these bikini-stuffers can go: Backstage areas, hotel rooms... We need to get somebody in there. Yeah! Now I\\'m thinking... ...undercover. Good idea, boss. I got just the girl. - Huh? Huh? - All right. That\\'s nothing. Check this out. Compliments of my daughter: The \"Dress Up Sally\" web site. What did I tell you? Hot, right? Yeah, baby. You got a little problem. She\\'s perfect! Look to the left. Down... down... HART: There you go. ERIC: \"On maternity leave\"? That\\'s not gonna work. Not unless it\\'s \"The Miss Lamaze Pageant.\" Can you do a search? Female field agents under 35. Jensen, Jensen! [MUMBLING AND LAUGHING] Wait, wait, wait, wait! I got it, I got it! Oh, no! That\\'s right, that\\'s right! You think that\\'s good? Check this out. I got the winner right here. Scorekeepers ready? This is the best part. Oh! He\\'s right behind me, isn\\'t he? Not really my color, is it? Sir, we were just... ...looking for someone to go undercover at the pageant. And I\\'m the best we have. It doesn\\'t inspire much confidence. Get back to work. - Hart, shouldn\\'t you be at a desk? - Yes, sir. You don\\'t say anything? Made me look like an idiot. HART: Do I have eyes in the back of my head? - He was standing right behind me. - What were we gonna say? - What? JENSEN: This one. ERIC: Are you kidding? It\\'s Hart. Cut it off. Let\\'s go back to work. Very funny. Hold on. That\\'s not bad. Hold on, nothing. Hit the save button because you won\\'t see that again. - What do you say? - No freaking way. Why not? I won\\'t parade around in a swimsuit like some bimbo... ...named Gracie Lou Freebush, and all she wants is world peace. It wouldn\\'t be like that. You\\'d be on the undercover team. Right. In a thong. In a tasteful one-piece! You do a few butt-shaping exercises... ...you could pull this off. You know what? Pull this off. Is it because McDonald hates me? Or is it, like, a woman thing? Don\\'t kid yourself. Nobody thinks of you that way. He\\'s punishing me, isn\\'t he? I had to beg him to let you do this. That\\'s right. Like it or not, you screwed up, pal. Sit down, sit down. I\\'ve never been in a beauty pageant. I don\\'t even own a dress. I don\\'t even own a brush. Ow, Jesus. Oh. Which part of that is supposed to shock me? Let\\'s suspend reality for a second... ...and pretend I said yes. I got to do everything? Like... ...the whole big hair and the makeup and... Damn right. The spinning, the twirling, the smiling, the cute little tap number. Hundred bucks on Matthews. I don\\'t know. She\\'s got rage. I\\'ll take that bet. - That\\'s right. That\\'s right. - Yeah! Yeah, baby. So you\\'re saying... ...I have to wear the bathing suit? Yeah, you have to wear the bathing suit. Okay. You go, girl. Where am I gonna put my gun? No place I want to know about. What could possibly motivate anybody to enter a beauty pageant? Scholarship money, a chance to see the world... ...broaden your horizons... So join the Marines. It\\'s like feminism never even happened. Any woman that does this is catering to misogynistic Neanderthal mentality. I dated Young Miss Scarsdale. Can you really be this superficial? Hard to believe, right? Here we are. ERIC: Therefore, we\\'d like to use one of our team undercover. Am I hearing this correctly? Kathy, these people want to put one of their agents... ...in the pageant. They want her to win? No, ma\\'am. We will need your help with the judging... ...so our agent is in the top five... ...to have access to all the areas at all times. - Absolutely not. HART: Miss Morningside... ...we understand how important this beauty pageant... Excuse me. This is not a beauty pageant. This is a scholarship program. And it has been ever since my reign. I fully intend on maintaining that credo. ERIC: Absolutely, Miss Morningside. We\\'re here to protect the girls. Women. Scholarship ladies. There\\'s nothing more important to me than the safety of my girls. I\\'d rather cancel the pageant than have them blown up. Especially without their knowledge. We went to the network to cancel, but they refused. We can\\'t force them. I\\'m confused. What state is she going to be from? All the winners have been chosen. We recently discovered some information about Miss New Jersey. And her performance in a little film called Arma Get It On. Was that her? Oh, yeah! She was gonna drop out pretty soon, if you know what I mean. Do you have an agent in mind? Sorry. Let me get you Victor Melling\\'s number. Frank. He\\'s our pageant consultant. Frank. Maybe he can do something to help. Frank! Oh! Just one minute. This is my assistant, Frank Tobin. Hi, everyone. Would you get these people Victor\\'s number, please? And get me a spring water. And tuck in your shirt. That, that was... a water for you... ...and... Victor Melling\\'s number. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Melling. How are you? If you are Grace Hart, I quit here and now. I\\'m having a bad hair day. Bad hair decade, really. I\\'m Eric Matthews. We spoke. Your hair is perfect. However, I can\\'t accept this job. There\\'s no way I can make this woman ready in two days. Please, Mr. Melling, give it a chance. Sit down. Have lunch. Totally on the Bureau. I suppose that would be the civilized thing to do. I\\'ll take a rain check. I got to take care of some FBI stuff. That thing I told you about that I gotta do. But I\\'ll see you later. We\\'ll hang out. You like caps? I\\'ll get you an official FBI cap. See you later. What a pity. - Are you hungry? - Yeah. - Yes. - Yeah. It is always \"yes,\" never \"yeah.\" Sit down. Miss United States is always well-spoken and polite. Do you understand? Watch the hands, gar�on. - Excuse me. VICTOR: It\\'s all right. I have a feeling we\\'re going to need a drop cloth later. VICTOR: Could I have another cabernet sauvignon? Another keg for you? - I\\'m good, thanks. VICTOR: That\\'s okay, Philip. So, how long have you been doing this pageant-training thing? I\\'m sorry? What was the question? I was distracted by a half-masticated cow... ...rolling around in your wide-open trap. Excuse me? What is your problem? - Problem? - Yeah. I mean, yes. Have I offended you in some way? You\\'ve been completely antagonistic to me from the second I walked in. I was once the most sought-after, highly paid... ...consultant in pageant history. I had no idea. Every season, girls would plead with me to train them. Ten out of 11 years... ...my girls were crowned. The year we lost, the winner was a deaf-mute. You can\\'t beat that. Then... ...in \\'96... ...my girl froze like a puddle halfway through her aria from La Boh�me. Afterwards, she told a reporter from Pageant Magazine... ...that I was a perfectionist... ...who had harangued her to within an inch of her sanity. Of course, after that article came out... ...nobody wanted me. Okay. With all due respect here... ...why did Miss Morningside suggest you? Because I am the best. Or perhaps it\\'s because everyone else worth having had a contestant. They had their Southern belles, their Midwestern farmers\\' daughters. Spunky Western cowgirls. And I have... [CRYSTAL HUMS] ...Dirty Harriet. Will you desist? Yeah. Yes. Oh, my God. I haven\\'t seen a walk like that since Jurassic Park. It\\'s been working really well for me for the past 30 years, all right? Well, glide, now. Glide. Don\\'t look down, don\\'t look down. Don\\'t look down, look up. Your chin should be parallel to the floor. Now glide. Glide. It\\'s not the bloody Ice Capades. Gliding. No, no. Don\\'t pick your feet up. Don\\'t pick your feet up. Why are you picking your feet up? Because I\\'m preparing to run away. - No, wait. Wait. - What? Watch me. Glide. Glide. See? Glide. It\\'s all in the buttocks. Don\\'t I look pretty? It takes a very secure man to walk like that. Roll your hips. Head up, head up. Keep gliding... I\\'m gliding here! CABBIE: What are you, blind? Asshole. VICTOR: Look how she walks. She\\'s floating. Lightly ascending from cloud to cloud... ...towards heaven. He takes one look at that fake rack... ...he\\'s gonna send her right back. Look, she\\'s gonna cry again. \"If I only had a brain!\" I am somewhat less than amused. How\\'s she doing? With some intensive work... ...she\\'ll be ready for the world\\'s finest trailer park. Thank you! Both painful... ...and grotesque. Isn\\'t it? Oh, my God! Mr. Vic, we got everything you asked for. Where do we start? Teeth, hair, manicure, pedicure. Which one first? What are you gonna do to my teeth? VICTOR: Hopefully, remove the beer stains and steak residue. Can\\'t I get some Novocain? It\\'s only a cleaning. Sweeney Todd, what are you doing? Your hair should make a statement. As long as it\\'s not, \"Thanks for the Country Music Award.\" You\\'ll be lucky if I can get it untangled. No mercy. Can I borrow that drill? WOMAN OVER SPEAKER: Attention. Attention. All hair removal units, wax, electrolysis, laser... ...to commence at 2300 hours. [HART GROANS] HART: Hello. Ah! [HART SCREAMS] Bikini wax. How you doing? Ever seen one this big? Sandwich, I mean. That\\'s a lot of meat. Thank you! Nobody said this job was easy. Mm, mm, mm. This earpiece lets you hear anybody on our frequencies. I don\\'t need it. With all this foil, I\\'m getting HBO. This is a pin camera. There\\'s an actual lens in there. It provides a digital video feed to our hookups. Here\\'s your new IDs. Pageant identity. Gracie Lou Freebush? I remembered you liked that. Well, my IQ just dropped 10 points. More... fluffy. Eyebrows. There should be two. Another two coats. And a sealant. Unbelievable. Where the hell is she? What could possibly be taking this long? [\"MUSTANG SALLY\" PLAYS] ERIC: Hart, is that you? I\\'m in a dress, I have gel in my hair, I haven\\'t slept... ...I\\'m starved and I\\'m armed. Don\\'t mess with me. Ooh. I\\'m fine. I\\'m cool. I\\'m good. Yeah, that\\'s her. Mr. Vic, nice work! Thank you. My God, I\\'m good. ERIC: Okay, Gracie Lou, listen up. \"Operation Thong\" has commenced. Why don\\'t you stun-gun yourself? I knew she\\'d like that one. KATHY: Victor? Try not to speak. Victor! Miss Morningside, if it\\'s possible... ...you look more radiant than ever. Then I guess it\\'s possible. Hello. Hi. Miss Hart?! I mean, Miss Freebush. Victor, I see you haven\\'t completely lost your touch. You look absolutely perfect. And you\\'re just in time for the orientation breakfast. You\\'ll take the bags to the room? It\\'s been a while since you\\'ve been with us... ...but you remember how everything goes. One little mistake and I\\'m a bloody bellhop. Ohio. Oh-hi-yo! Washington. Nice apples. Original. You come up with that all by yourself? - Miss Freebush! - I got it. I got it. New Jersey? Welcome. [CHATTERING] WOMAN 1: Who\\'s she? WOMAN 2: Have you seen her before? Oh, hey, New Jersey? This one\\'s empty. Thanks. - I\\'m Cheryl from Rhode Island. - Hi, I\\'m... Gracie Lou Freebush. I memorized the orientation pamphlet. I know all 49 ladies by name and picture. Fifty, including myself. Your picture wasn\\'t there, so I knew it was you from your lack of picture. How about a little song for the drive? I think you know the one I mean. From sea to shining sea Like Lady Liberty She reigns over all she sees She\\'s beauty and she\\'s grace She\\'s Miss United States Entering Barbie-town. We\\'re up and running. CLONSKY: I love my job! - Not a bad view. - Not at all. There\\'s our table! CHERYL: I got here three days early so I could... CLONSKY: Look at all the hoochie mama! Not the pastry! Ladies, I would like you to meet Gracie Lou Freebush from New Jersey. Karen Krantz, New York. What\\'s up, Jersey? - Mary Jo Wright, Texas. - Hi there. CHERYL: Belinda Brown, Tennessee. - Hi. - I like that! - Oh, yeah! Leslie Davis, California. Hey, girl. And Alana Krewson, Hawaii. Aloha. Aloha to you too! I want you all to know, I believe what it says on the sign at the Alamodome. We are all winners. ERIC: Hey, Hart! You think she\\'s hungry? Most important, we\\'re getting our issues out there for people to hear. And it\\'s an honor to have made it this far. Especially when you\\'re from a small state... That\\'s so true! - Us Rhode Islanders... - I wasn\\'t finished. Did it sound like I was? I\\'m sorry. Why are you apologizing to her? She\\'s been drinking too much Coppertone. - Are you talking to me? - Yeah, I am. Question: In Hawaii, don\\'t you use \"Aloha\" for hello and goodbye? So? If you\\'re on the phone with someone who won\\'t stop talking... ...and you say \"aloha,\" don\\'t they start again? At least she thinks I\\'m funny. Hart? Hart, do you copy? - What\\'s up? - I don\\'t know. It\\'s not working. - It worked five minutes ago. - Who put it together? Check one, check one... Thank you so much. Thank you. For the past 21 years... ...it has been my honor to serve as director of this pageant. And I know that this year will be our most exciting event ever! Couple of geniuses I\\'m working with. After the rehearsal and a photo shoot, you can settle into your rooms. Tomorrow we will begin the preliminaries... ...hosted by our master of ceremonies... ...an American institution, Stan Fields. STAN: Thank you! Oh, thank you, Kathy! Let\\'s go! Get it back online! HARRIS: We\\'re working on it. CLONSKY: We\\'re trying. Thank you, Kathy. Isn\\'t she ravishing?! How does she do it? I look in the mirror and say, \"Who\\'s that old man in my pajamas?\" And even though I\\'ll be retiring this year... Well, don\\'t cry for me... Alabama. That\\'s so sad. He\\'s retiring. He\\'s not retiring. I spoke to him this morning, and he blurted it out. They\\'re firing him, going for someone newer and younger. I hope it\\'s Ricky Martin. Hey, hey, hey. Jesus Christ! Oh. Oh, I uh... I\\'m sorry. I had a bite of my bagel and I forgot to pray. Dear Jesus, please forgive me... ...for not praying before I had a bite of my bagel and schmeer. Thank you very much. Amen. [ABBA\\'S \"DANCING QUEEN\" PLAYS] - Hi! - Hi. I hope I\\'m not disturbing you. Oh, no, I was just, you know... ...grooming. I made some of my famous hot chocolate. Oh, um... My roommate\\'s asleep, or she\\'s starting to mold. But do you want to come in? CHERYL: I asked some of the other girls... ...but when they heard \"chocolate\" they slammed their doors. They didn\\'t give me a chance to say \"nonfat.\" Well, here\\'s to... ...world peace. World peace. Mmm. Mm. Hot. I\\'m sorry. I have to tell you... ...I thought it was really great how you settled that argument today. \"Aloha, aloha.\" That\\'s why you\\'re gonna win. You\\'re so clever. You should tell jokes for your talent. What is your talent? It\\'s... It\\'s kind of like... It\\'s, you know, it\\'s like a surprise. - Oh. - Yeah, yeah. But don\\'t worry, it\\'s nothing embarrassing. Not anything like baton twirling or anything. So, what\\'s your talent? Oh, Cheryl, I\\'m sorry. Twirling can be a real art. I saw this cheerleader doing it at a football game. She lit her batons on fire and did this sexy dance. I wish I could do something like that. Why can\\'t you? My parents don\\'t like anything ostentatious. And they really don\\'t like fire. Cheryl, I think you have as good a chance as anyone to win. You believe in yourself to have gotten this far, right? - Really? - Yeah. Wow. You\\'re so nice and so smart and so sensitive. You\\'re definitely gonna win. That\\'s it. Excuse me. I am in the middle of a REM cycle over here. - Sorry. - I\\'m sorry. Yes. [KNOCKING] Not happening. - What? - You took your earpiece out. - Vic needs you. - Now? - I haven\\'t slept in two days! - I\\'ll give you a cookie. It better be a big one. VICTOR: You don\\'t walk, you float. Gently descending, you don\\'t look down. Go back up and do it again. Never, ever look down, okay? Thighs touching... - Touching, not clenching. - I\\'m touching. There\\'s a gap between knees and calves, your calves and your ankles. Right now there\\'s a huge gap between my brain and my spinal cord. Here. Take these. What, no armored car? That would be in my other dress. What are you planning to do for your talent? Sing? Dance? Chew with your mouth closed? I\\'ll do whatever you want, Yoda. Oh, Lord. Agent Matthews! - This woman has no talent! - Don\\'t shout it in front of her. I wasn\\'t told to provide a talent. I can\\'t do so in the next five hours! Wait a minute. What are you talking about? She\\'ll be on-stage with nothing to do... ...but convert oxygen into carbon dioxide! You said you couldn\\'t make her pretty in two days, but she\\'s gorgeous. Compared to the car wreck she was before. My duties are stated in a contract, and I have fulfilled them. - You talent her up by tomorrow or... - Are you threatening me? - Listen to me, you old fruitcake! - How dare you, you cupcake! There\\'s something I know how to do. I haven\\'t done it since high school... - You\\'re not having sex on this stage. - I didn\\'t know it was an option. This thing, I just have to call room service. Miss Hart. Please. Thank you. And the other one. Thank you. All right, all right, all right. Happy, you doughnut Nazi? Did I tell you Stan Fields was getting fired? I\\'m on it. You just concentrate on being Gracie Lou, all right. And by the way, you\\'re doing a great job. I thought the evening gown looked... - I totally bought it. - I know, you think I\\'m gorgeous. I don\\'t think you\\'re gorgeous. You think I\\'m gorgeous. You want to kiss me. You want to hug me... McDonald\\'s more feminine. I\\'d rather kiss him. - Love me. You want to hug me. You want to smooch me. Enjoy the rest of your night. Gracie, you look so tired. MARY JO: Oh, she had a busy night. I saw that gentleman stop by the room. CHERYL: Gentleman? Uh-huh. - No men in the room. - It\\'s different on the mainland. Hold on, ladies. Let\\'s hear her side of the story. You sleeping with a judge? Oh. Oh, that guy? No. No, no, I was dating him for a little while because... ...he said he had an incurable disease. I didn\\'t realize it was stupidity. MARY JO: Oh, I know what that\\'s like. - All right. He is such a pathetic loser. I\\'m sorry he\\'s obsessed with me, but at some point it\\'s like, \"Hello!\" \"Move on! Get over yourself!\" His ego is this big. But his equipment is like this big! Good cover! We worked that out together. HART: Use it for a needle. Back to work. Get ready for the Alamo. Thank you. Thank you. And welcome to the Miss United States Preliminary... ...here at the beautiful and historical Alamo! Prepare for what promises to be... ...a day of astounding musical, theatrical and dancing talent. And after I\\'m finished, you can see the ladies. Oh, yes! And now, put it together... ...for Miss Mary Jo Wright from Texas! You light up my life [SINGS OPERA] What\\'s her talent, bartending? [CRYSTAL HUMS] [HUMS SOFTER] I made it very clear you weren\\'t responsible for making her credible. I wish I could explain... ...but there are no words. Eagle-Eye. You might want to check out cowboy at 1:00. My 1:00 or your 1:00? The one under the white Stetson. There\\'s Stetsons everywhere. He\\'s moving, he\\'s moving. HART: Toward the stage. - Hold on, we\\'re checking it out. Guys. Guys, he has a gun. He has a gun. HART: Who\\'s got the 20 on the shooter? I\\'m taking him out. Wait for a visual! Gun! Gun! Everybody down! Better up to them, don\\'t you think? NEWSCASTER: In a bizarre incident at the Miss United States Preliminaries... ...the contestant from New Jersey leapt off-stage... ...and tackled a man in the crowd who was trying to light a cigarette. She\\'s here with me right now. What were you thinking when you jumped off the stage? All the contestants are actively involved in ending tobacco dependence. I think the gentleman will think twice before he lights up again. I\\'m sure we all will. - Look, he had a gun. - Of course. This is Texas, everyone has a gun. My florist has a gun. I don\\'t have a gun. My ancestors were Quakers. Stan, please! We assume any man with a weapon is a suspect. We got the DNA results. The envelope from the Citizen was licked by a woman. There\\'s never been DNA before. He slipped up, or I should say \"she.\" This is preposterous. You people are completely clueless. If I ran my pageant like this, we\\'d be holding it in someone\\'s basement! Every operation is bound to have its screwups. As far as I can see, she\\'s still with us. Oh, God! Could I have a moment alone with Miss Hart, please? Sure. Just for a tiny minute. We\\'ll just be a moment. Shop talk. Hair, gel, mousse. Look, I know I made a mistake. I\\'m sorry. I\\'ve been fighting all my life against your type. The ones who think we\\'re a bunch of worthless airheads. You know who I mean. Feminists... ...intellectuals... ...ugly women. I refuse to give in to their cynicism. That\\'s why I have dedicated my entire life to this scholarship. No one\\'s going to ruin that. Not this year. You get in my way, I will kill you. Do you understand? Yeah. - Yes! - Yes. KATHY: Frank! The interview is the single most important part of the pageant. It accounts for 30% of your total score. What\\'s the other 70%, cleavage? Is this your idea of doing final preps on the convention center? Look. Liberace\\'s got her in a nice evening gown. McDonald called. He saw Hart\\'s anti- smoking commercial. He\\'s on his way. Good, perfect. I\\'d hate for him to fire me over the phone. I can\\'t believe this! It\\'ll be ugly. No shit. I gotta do something. I\\'m gonna go do laps. We\\'ll go over tomorrow\\'s assignments. You got it. Hands folded... ...ankles crossed. Neck up! And remember, smile. Smilers wear a crown, losers wear a frown. I would so love to hurt you right now. As long as you smile. Now... Why is New Jersey called... ...the Garden State? You can\\'t fit \"Oil and petrochemical refinery state\" on a license plate? I don\\'t appreciate your immaturity... ...when I\\'m working as hard as I am. What\\'s the big deal? It\\'s fixed, I\\'m in the top five. Congratulations to me. Is that enough? Have you no pride in yourself, in your presentation? I\\'m an FBI agent, right? I\\'m not a performing monkey in heels. You\\'re also a person, and an incomplete one at that! In place of friends and relationships, you have sarcasm and a gun. Oh, I have sarcasm? When every word that comes out of your mouth is dripping with disdain? That is because I am a miserable, grumpy elitist, and that works for me. I don\\'t have relationships because I don\\'t want them. And I don\\'t have friends because I work 24-7. And you have no idea why I am the way that I am. As we\\'re practicing interviews, why are you the way you are? None of your damn business. The judges probably have never heard that before. We have more to do here. No, we are finished. Finished. - Give me a 20 on Matthews. - Be advised he\\'s at the pool. \"How do you feel about gun control?\" Favorable. Thought I\\'d let you know I was quitting. Take care. Hold on. Wait a minute. - What do you mean? - I mean, you got the wrong girl. All right? I do not need this now. That\\'s what I\\'m saying! I\\'m totally screwing up in there! I don\\'t feel like a real agent anymore. I mean, Vic says this thing that\\'s so... I don\\'t care what he said, you know? I don\\'t care. Because I am the job... ...and I\\'m okay with that. You\\'re the job? Yeah, I\\'m the job. We\\'re all the job. Then what\\'s wrong with me? I date. I know everyone thinks I haven\\'t had a date in 10 years. Is that what you think? I think you date. Damn right I do. But both times it was screwed up. I don\\'t even care. All I want to do... ...is my job. For the last three days I feel like I\\'m completely lost. I\\'ve been waiting five years to run my own op. - Would I blow it on the wrong girl? - You picked me... ...because I looked good and wasn\\'t on maternity leave. No, that\\'s why they let me pick you. Know why? - Lost a bet. - You\\'re smart... ...and funny and you\\'re easy to talk to when you\\'re unarmed. Give yourself a break and cut Vic some slack. Because if they see what I see, then... ...they\\'ll love you. So, what do you say? I won\\'t let you down. Good, that\\'s what I want to hear. In all honesty, I might let you down. But I\\'ll try my best not to. Do not mess with the dress. Oh, Vic is gonna kill you. You in big trouble. Why? You fell. - You look good wet. - Shut up! Whoa, guys, Hart\\'s in the dressing room. Come on. HARRIS: You see the legs on that girl? CLONSKY: Who\\'s your daddy? Those better be candy dishes! Turn around. Open. This guy\\'s like an inch from death! AGENT: But what a way to go! - Break it up. Nothing to see. - What do you mean? She\\'s a federal agent. Come on. Guess it\\'s time to apply at my local Hooters. Hemorrhoid ointment? You think the judges will look that closely? It\\'s for the baggies under your eyes. Really? Good, hair spray. Finally something I recognize. What are you doing? It stops the suit from riding up. Riding up where? Just up! That\\'s enough! Why do you make things hard? I can see this is an incredibly embarrassing situation for you. Why does Georgia get to wear a one-piece and I have to wear this?! If you can do this, then you can convince anyone that you belong here. Places, everybody! Let\\'s go! The Swimsuit Preliminary accounts for 15% of the total score... ...and tests the grace, athleticism and poise... ...of each lovely woman. The last time I was naked in public, I came out of a uterus. I don\\'t have breasts, my thighs... I should wear a muumuu. I have avoided this experience all my life. And here it is. You must achieve a Zen-like state. Listen to your breathing, feel your heart... ...think of the Dalai Lama. Texas! Rhode Island! New Jersey! Dalai Lama, Dalai Lama, Dalai Lama... STAN: New York! California! I would have to say, world peace. Definitely, world peace. That\\'s easy. World peace. World peace. What is the one most important thing our society needs? That would be harsher punishment for parole violators, Stan. And, world peace. Thank you, Gracie Lou. And thank you, Stan. Cheryl Frasier from Rhode Island. That was charming. Are you drunk? Glad you enjoyed it. Now excuse me, I have to go unscrew my smile. We got a lead. - The blood test? - Photos. Cheryl Frasier, with members of a radical animal rights group... ...involved in bombings. VIC: It\\'s always the quiet ones. She fits the profile: Loner, introverted. That Cheryl? Describe your perfect date. That\\'s a tough one. I\\'d have to say April 25th... ...because it\\'s not too hot, not too cold. All you need is a light jacket. Now, there is a hardened criminal. Maybe she\\'s an accomplice. Maybe she\\'s his inside connection. That\\'s what you gotta find out. How? Buddy up to her, you know, girl talk. - Girl talk? - Yes, girl talk. Sorry, I\\'m totally drawing a blank. Leg waxing, fake orgasms, the inability of men to commit. Why don\\'t you talk to her? Lmagine she\\'s me and you want to know, but I don\\'t want to talk about it. What would you do? You want me to beat her? Why don\\'t you talk to her? Okay, forget about it. I will go. Put that back in your ear. I can\\'t talk girl talk with a guy in my head. I can\\'t even do it with me in my head. Girl talk. Oh, my God! Hey, Rhode Island, how you doing? How can you ask that? You heard my interview. I was like a female Rain Man. Oh, no, it def-def-definitely wasn\\'t Rain Man. Definitely not Rain Man. Come and have a midnight snack with me and some... ...girl talk. Are you crazy? We can\\'t have pizza and beer! Do you know how many calories you\\'re talking about? It\\'s light beer and she\\'s gonna throw it up anyway. Come on. Come with. No? No takers? No? All right, I\\'ll just... ...sit here. You guys go back on your bicycles... ...and I\\'ll sit here with my very large, cheesy pizza. Oh, look at all that cheese. Mmm, mm, mm. Cheryl, don\\'t. At least scrape off the toppings. First step, pizza. Second step, flaming batons... [MOANING] ALANA: Let me have some. Oh, yeah. I guess we\\'ll be needing more pizza. [DANCE MUSIC PLAYS] - I want another drink! - Okay! We\\'re gonna get a drink. Another round, ladies? - I can\\'t do another one! HART: Yes, you can! This is so weird! This is my third one and I don\\'t feel a thing! Really? Like when I did my interview question. Don\\'t worry, we all sucked. You know, I had such a good answer to that question too. My idea of a perfect date would be a man... ...who takes me to a romantic dinner. Then we walk along the beach barefoot, discussing books... ...and music and movies! Aw. No wonder you\\'re still a virgin. Time to paint. Come on. No, my contacts. [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] - We\\'ll stay here. - I want more pizza. We\\'re gonna have more pizza and beer. Have fun! - This is so much fun. - Yeah, it\\'s fun. It\\'s so fun it should be illegal. Speaking of illegal, have you ever, like... ...committed a crime? Yes! Yes, I did. Go on. One time I stole red underwear from the department store. My mother wouldn\\'t buy them! She said they were Satan\\'s panties. - So is that it? - Yeah. Oh, there was this one thing in college... ...with my lit professor. One day I came to his office. He said he wanted to discuss a paper I wrote. He wanted to discuss a paper, right? Hey, can I get another one of these tubie things? Yeah, can we get another tubie? Anyway, he attacked me. Cheryl, did you report him? No, I never told anyone before this. I know that happens all the time. No, it doesn\\'t! Cheryl, it doesn\\'t. There are so many maneuvers that I could show you. Really? Yeah! Come on, get up. I want you to firmly plant your feet. I\\'m gonna move the chair. Now if someone comes at you... She\\'s completely trashed. We should get her back before Miss Morningside finds out. Kathy\\'s got a boot up her ass about something. I don\\'t think she ever got over those rumors. Come again? Her pageant years she was a runner-up. But then the winner mysteriously got food poisoning. Bizarro! No, Stan told me she got a letter a few weeks back from the network... ...and they\\'re firing her too! She threw a chair out the window! We gotta go. Come on. I got 20 people here waiting for confirmation. Don\\'t tell me I don\\'t understand. I hate when I don\\'t see a wet paint sign. Stop it. Listen. - Can\\'t hear you, took out my earpiece. - I have a lead and it\\'s not Cheryl. Forget it. They bagged the Citizen. What? Where? It\\'s confirmed. He was holing up in a shack in Nevada. Place had enough C4 to make a new Grand Canyon. Let\\'s pack up and get out of here. Sir, I need to talk to you. One second of your time. - Hart. - Hear me out a second. I feel the situation bears further scrutiny and our continued presence. Do you have paint in your ears? We caught the guy! I respect what you\\'re saying. I\\'d say the same to me... ...but what if we were wrong? What if the Citizen didn\\'t send it? What if it was a copycat? The letter didn\\'t follow the normal pattern. The linguistic scheme was uncharacteristic... ...and the DNA said it was a woman! Maybe he got his girlfriend to lick the envelope. I think we have reason to monitor Morningside. Why don\\'t you jump on her dressed like a Bavarian fruitcake? You\\'re the reason I had to drag myself down here... ...and I don\\'t want to hear anymore! You\\'re absolutely right, sir. Not another damn word. Thank you. But she\\'s getting fired this year, which she didn\\'t tell us. You\\'re already in enough trouble with the review board. Yeah, but when she was in the pageant, the only reason she won was... ...because the winner got food poisoning. How bizarro is that? - \"Bizarro\"? - Oh! Oh! She threatened me. According to Mary Jo, she has a history of violence. Who is Mary Jo? Are you getting your information from a pajama party? Would you shut up? You\\'re shutting up enough for both of us. - Matthews. - Yes, sir? Is there any reason to suspect Morningside? No, sir. There. I request permission to stay with a small contingent. - Denied. - Then I request permission to stay alone. You know what, I don\\'t care what you do. You want to stay, stay! But as a private citizen. Turn in your badge and your gun. Everybody, I suggest we start packing. What? Don\\'t look at me like I betrayed you. Betrayal implies action. You stood there. You got nothing to go on. I know everyone thinks I\\'m a screwup. But I feel like I\\'m in the right place at the right time. I have to protect those girls. It is my job. Part of it is following orders. The other part is using your brain. Throw out the rule book... I like the book. I like knowing what I can and cannot do. You\\'re not the only one who lives for the job. I want to keep mine for the next 20 or 30 years. Jesus, Hart. Give it a rest. Sure, give it a rest. What are you doing? Don\\'t do it. [CLAPPING] Thank you. Thank you so much. I can\\'t believe it! Hi, Mom. Don\\'t do that! That slow, creepy thing in the shadows. Your father used to do that. Mom. This isn\\'t gonna work. Honey, of course it\\'s going to work. The feds caught the Citizen. We have no one to pin it on! Okay, that was bad luck. But what about all these other letters from terrorist groups threatening us? \"Women\\'s Liberation Front.\" \"Islamic Jihad.\" They\\'re not so nuts about the swimsuit competition. Any one of these could have planted a bomb. When did we get those? I just finished writing them. Just like the Citizen letter. You\\'re a genius. No, Frank. I\\'m just pissed off. Nobody fires me and gets away with it. They want a newer, hotter show... ...they\\'re gonna get it. Mom, you\\'re a little scary. And you\\'re a little bit sloppy. Tuck your shirt. I don\\'t want to tell you again. Let\\'s go home, honey. Mom? Oops. What\\'s up? - Need a hand, boss? - I got it. Okay, Vic. Beautify me. Hair, makeup, shellac, whatever it is you do. That shiny stuff... Where are you going? Your Agent McDonald insists that I depart, or I won\\'t be compensated. No. After the top 10! I am completely on my own. The FBI is gone, it\\'s not fixed. I need you! Not anymore. The cocoon is open. I\\'ve taken a woman without a smidgen of estrogen... ...and made her a lady. - Come on. - I\\'ve never been prouder of myself. Or... ...of any girl I have ever coached. You are truly unique. If I ever had a daughter, I imagine that she would be... ...something like you. Which is why I never reproduced. I have a really strong feeling something will happen to these girls. You need to stay for me. Please. I can\\'t. But I can leave you this. I was saving it for tonight. It\\'s your size, I believe. Good luck to you, Gracie Lou. It\\'s been a privilege. No insults today? You\\'re a Don Ho. Has anyone seen Gracie? I can\\'t believe she missed dress rehearsal. Maybe she couldn\\'t take the pressure. She ate four slices last night. We all saw her glasses performance. She is not making the top 10. I overslept my beauty sleep. - Do you need help? - No, I\\'m fine. I wonder which one of these... ...is lipstick. Ladies! Now, the first thing we need to deal with... [TALKING SIMULTANEOUSLY] Good luck, ladies! Keep it moving. Let\\'s go! Looking good, ladies. Will you go back to the mothership? As long as you go with me, Tex-Ass. Let\\'s go, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Texas... I can\\'t open the goddamn bottle. Frank! SCOTT: Have a good show. You guys excited? Get it. Where are you going? I forgot my breasts. Hold on, I\\'ll be back. Going live. In five, four, three... It\\'s the 75th Annual Miss United States Pageant... ...live from San Antonio, Texas! [BOSSON\\'S \"ONE IN A MILLION\" PLAYS] Good. That\\'s the one I use at home. And your host for the evening, Stan Fields! Good evening, ladies and gentlemen! And welcome to a night of beauty, talent and poise. I\\'m not just talking about my cohost... ...Kathy Morningside! - Hello, Kathy. - Stan, you charmer. But you forgot to mention \"incredible intelligence.\" That was incredibly stupid of me. How can I make it up? By helping me to announce the top 10... ...chosen based on their performance during the preliminaries this week. Here\\'s the envelope. Thank you, Scott. Ladies, hold your breath. Hawaii! Follow her. Beautiful. Come in for that reaction. - Go to two. - Going to two. California! New York! Alaska! Texas! Thank you. New Jersey! Thank you, thank you. Oh, shit! That was graceful. STAN: That must have hurt. But she\\'s up and at it. And last but not least, Rhode Island. And there they are! This year\\'s top 10 finalists. Well, the top 10 have been chosen. We\\'ll be right back with tonight\\'s swimsuit competition. I checked out Kathy Morningside. - Anything? - Not even a traffic ticket. Model citizen. Beauty contestant, pageant director, loving mom. - She\\'s married? - Widow. One son. A sniveling, obsequious weasel of a human being. - You know her son? - So do you. It\\'s Frank. - Her assistant? - Asshole Frank? One and the same. She never mentioned anything. Anything come up on the CCH? Nothing on Frank Tobin. There wouldn\\'t be. His name is Morningside. He changed it to cover his many indiscretions. Wait. How do you know that? I\\'ve been around this pageant for many years. I could shock you with the intimate details I\\'m privy to. Good job! Good job Keep going, everybody. Keep moving. Hey, hey. I got you something. Oh! Oh. I couldn\\'t... You ate pizza, you stole panties, you\\'re wild. We worked on this, remember? You\\'re gonna be great. - Can I see your ticket? - Federal officer. I\\'m with him. [HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYS] Gentlemen, you can\\'t go in... Victor! He\\'s with me. Wait. I\\'m not \"with him\" with him. Come on, muffin. Thank you! She certainly lit my fire. Now you can wear Satan\\'s panties! Oh, my God, I gotta go on! - Hey, Hart. - What are you doing here? I think you might have been right. Frank is Kathy Morningside\\'s son. Disgusting, perverted Frank? He cleared under another name. I ran a new CCH. DUI, assault, even a weapons charge. Are we doing full deployment? McDonald didn\\'t want to hear about it. It\\'s just us. Interview set change, five minutes. Good show, Mr. Tobin. Get ready. Interview set change, five minutes. You\\'re up next, New Jersey. I gotta get my glasses. Hey! You\\'re drinking my talent! You got to make it into the top five. - Can you whistle? - No! - Make hand puppets? - No! I had a girl who rearranged furniture. You said all I have is sarcasm and a gun. That and a right hook. And now, the musical stylings of Gracie Lou Freebush. Good evening. The program says I\\'m supposed to play the water glasses for you... ...but the girls got dehydrated. No water glasses? You want me to go to a commercial? No, stay on her. Go with it. I believe no woman should be without a basic knowledge of self-defense. So in order to show you this, I\\'m gonna need a little help. I would like to bring out my assistant, Eric Bob. More changes? Follow her. Stay on her. - How to inflict damage with the least amount of force. In some cases, your attacker might come at you in a frontal assault. Use the heel of your hand and thrust. This will cause the nose to break and your assailant\\'s eyes to tear... ...giving you a chance to get away. All right. Let\\'s say your assailant comes at you from behind. Attack me! Oh. Little Eric looks a little scared. Maybe he needs a little applause. Yeah! Eric! She\\'s kicking his ass! LESLIE: You were the best queen ever. Thank you, that is so sweet. Ladies, give Lori some room to breathe. Go on, now. You need some powder. You don\\'t have to hold the crown all night. My God, that is disgraceful. Frank! Take this to the prop master. See if you can\\'t get it to shine. If all else fails, go for the four sensitive areas of the body. But just remember to \"sing.\" S-l-N-G. Solar plexus, instep... ...nose, groin! SING. Cue Stan. Whoa. Welcome to the Garden State! When we return, we\\'ll find out who those lucky final five are. Let\\'s go find Frank. Take left. I\\'ll take this side. No, evening gown. Now. STAN: Ladies! In one moment, five of you... ...will be one step closer to the crown. And one of those five... ...is... ...California! Leslie Williams is a music major. She believes in the healing power of music. Loves opera, reggae... ...and, like any true California girl, the Beach Boys. Rhode Island! Cheryl Frasier is a science major. Her field is... ...nuclear fission with a minor in elementary particles. STAN: Nebraska! For Kelly Beth Kelly, all the world is a stage. A theater major... ...she helps run a drama program for underprivileged children. New Jersey! Gracie Lou Freebush hopes to become a pediatrician. Gracie, it\\'s you. Go! KATHY: Her hobbies include figure skating, water ballet... ...and taking long, luxurious bubble baths. You go, Gracie Lou. And our fifth finalist: Texas! Mary Jo Wright is a psychology major. In her spare time, she works in a homeless shelter... ...and eats Mexican food. Thank you, ladies. You were magnificent. I want all the lesbians to know... ...if I can make it to the top 10, so can you! Big out to Brooklyn! Yo! Get her off of there! Go to Stan! Tina, I love you, baby! I love you, Karen! Whoo! Yeah! And we\\'ll be right back with our final five lesbians. Interviews. Bumper. Commercial. Can we say \"lesbians\"? You got a problem with that? In a way, America is like a big ship. When we work together and respect each other... ...that\\'s when the ship gets safely home. Terrific answer. Damn it. New Jersey. As you may know, there are many who consider... ...the Miss United States pageant to be outdated and antifeminist. What would you say to them? Oh, my God. I would have to say, I used to be one of them. And then I came here... ...and I realized that... ...these women are smart, terrific people... ...who are just trying to make a difference in the world. We\\'ve become really good friends. I know we all secretly hope the other one will trip and fall on her face... Wait a minute! I\\'ve already done that! For me, this experience has been one of the most rewarding... ...and liberating experiences of my life. My God. I did it. And if anyone... ...anyone... ...tries to hurt one of my new friends... ...I would take them out. I would make them suffer so much, they\\'d wish they were never born. And if they ran, I would hunt them down. Thank you, Kathy. A brief, shining moment, and then that mouth. Helps if you pull it out. Good luck, ladies. Where\\'s the crown? I wanted to rub it for luck. Frank took it to get it polished. I\\'ll have it by the time they announce the winner. My God! It\\'s the crown! Yes, it is. You can taste it now... No, no, no! It goes Texas, Rhode Island and New Jersey. Let\\'s go. Not the... This. In the... SCOTT: Finale positions. Yes. Wear the crown. Be the crown. You are the crown. And now, the moment of truth and beauty. STAN: The envelope, please. What? A lot of tension. The fourth runner-up is... ...California! KATHY: The third runner-up is... ...Nebraska! - Am I in danger here? - Wait here. STAN: The second runner-up is Texas! Drop it! I mean it! Drop it! This is it. The moment. One of these two ladies will wear the crown. Listen to me! I\\'m gonna reach for my badge, slow. You do, and you\\'re dead. STAN: The first runner-up... ...who will have to take the winner\\'s place if, for any reason... ...she cannot fulfill her duties is: New Jersey! Which means... ...our new Miss United States is: Don\\'t take the crown. Rhode Island\\'s Cheryl Frasier! - Don\\'t take the crown. Trust me. - I can\\'t hear you. What? STAN: She reigns over all she sees She\\'s beauty and she\\'s grace She\\'s queen of 50 states She\\'s elegance and taste She\\'s Miss United States Hold your crown up high Go ahead, hold your crown up high Raise it to the sky Jersey\\'s gone berserk! Get her off the stage! Get away! Get away! STAN: Hold your crown up high Raise it to the sky Hold your crown up high She stands for all that\\'s good She loves her neighborhood She\\'s friends with everyone she meets She\\'s beauty and she\\'s grace She\\'s queen of 50 states She\\'s elegance and taste She\\'s Miss United States Hold your crown up high Gracie! Hold your crown up high She\\'s Miss United States. Okay. Good show, everybody. - I was right in the middle of my song! - There she is! You got nothing on me. This is ridiculous. Where you\\'re going, they\\'d love to meet a former beauty queen. When he says meet, he means M-E-A-T. Miss Hart, you don\\'t understand. All I\\'m guilty of is trying to make the world a more beautiful place. Look at yourself. When I met you, Dennis Rodman looked better in a dress. But now you\\'re a lady! I did that. Vic did that, and a team of highly specialized federal manicurists... ...and people who make you beautiful. Get in the car. You think you saved something. All you did was to destroy the dream of young women all over the country. Their dream is to get blown up? You got a good shot at that insanity plea. I earned it! Years of bitching beauty queens and what do I get? Fired! They steal my life, they steal my beauty pageant. Hey! It is not a beauty pageant. It is a scholarship program. Yeah, yeah. \"Yes.\" Enjoy running the Miss San Antonio Women\\'s Correctional Facility Pageant! - Get it? The Women\\'s Correctional... - Hey. That was good work. Right back at you. So, how does it feel? Throwing the rule book out of the window? Pretty good, actually. I was thinking... ...when we get back... ...after we write up our reports and you get all ugly again... ...maybe we could have dinner? What? You asking me out on a date? No. Just a casual dinner. If we happen to have sex afterwards, so be it. You think I\\'m gorgeous. You want to date me... ...love me and marry me. ERIC: A part of you is gonna miss this. The heels. They do something for my posture. I\\'m suddenly very aware and proud of my breasts. - Funny, me too. - Agent Matthews! Gracie! Thank God you\\'re still here. There\\'s been an emergency. Somebody found some sort of incendiary device. Come on, quickly! Excuse me. FBI. CHERYL: She saved the pageant, she saved our lives, and here she is! That\\'s not gonna work for me. I can\\'t go up there! It was his idea, Gracie Lou. I\\'d never get you here unless you could shoot someone. You\\'ll get yours, Henry Higgins. Come on. Come on! Ladies and gentlemen, agent Gracie Hart of the FBI! Not so fast! Because even though you\\'re a federal officer... ...to us, you will always be Gracie Lou Freebush.

      " 'Men are haunted by the vastness of eternity. And so we ask ourselves... ... will our actions echo across the centuries? Will strangers hear our names long after we\\'re gone... ... and wonder who we were... ... how bravely we fought... ... how fiercely we loved? Good day for the crows. I told you yesterday and I\\'ll tell you again today. Remove your army from my land. I like your land. I think we\\'ll stay. I like your soldiers too. They fought bravely yesterday. Not well, but bravely. They won\\'t fight for you. That\\'s what the Messenians said. And the Arcadians and the Epeians. Now they all fight for me. You can\\'t have the whole world, Agamemnon. It\\'s too big, even for you. I don\\'t want to watch another massacre. Let\\'s settle this war in the old manner. Your best fighter against my best. And if my man wins? We\\'ll leave Thessaly for good. I\\'m a generous man. If mine wins, you can keep your throne... ...but Thessaly falls under my command... ...to fight with me whenever I call. Boagrius! This is my man. Achilles! Boagrius has this effect on many heroes. Careful who you insult, old king. My king, Achilles is not with the army. - Where is he? - I sent a boy to look for him. I was having a good dream. Very good dream. King Agamemnon sent me. He needs to... I\\'ll speak to your king in the morning. But, my lord, it is morning. They\\'re waiting for you. Are the stories about you true? They say your mother is an immortal goddess. They say you can\\'t be killed. I wouldn\\'t be bothering with the shield then, would I? The Thessalonian you\\'re fighting... ...he\\'s the biggest man I\\'ve ever seen. I wouldn\\'t want to fight him. That\\'s why no one will remember your name. Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! Perhaps we should have our war tomorrow, when you\\'re better rested. I should have you whipped for your impudence! Perhaps you should fight him. Achilles. Achilles. Look at the men\\'s faces. You can save hundreds of them. You can end this war with a swing of your sword. Think how many songs they\\'ll sing in your honor. Let them go home to their wives. Imagine a king who fights his own battles. Wouldn\\'t that be a sight. Of all the warlords loved by the gods, I hate him the most. We need him, my king. For now. Is there no one else? Is there no one else? Who are you, soldier? Achilles. Son of Peleus. Achilles? I\\'ll remember the name. The ruler of Thessaly carries this scepter. Give it to your king. He\\'s not my king. - Brothers in arms! - Brothers in arms! - Friendship! - Friendship! Princes of Troy, on our last night together... ...Queen Helen and I salute you. We\\'ve had our conflicts before, it\\'s true. We fought many battles, Sparta and Troy. And fought well! But I have always respected your father. Priam is a good king, a good man. I respected him as an adversary. I respect him now as my ally. Hector, Paris, young princes, come. Stand. Drink with me. Let us drink to peace. To peace between Troy and Sparta. May the gods keep the wolves in the hills and the women in our beds. - For the gods. - For the gods. Strong arm. Thank the gods we made peace. I\\'ve seen too many of my men struck down with this arm. Never again, I hope. Only one man wields a sword better than you. Achilles. That madman. He would hurl a spear at Zeus himself. If the god insulted him. See that one over there? I picked her special for you. She\\'s a little lioness. Thank you. My wife waits for me in Troy. My wife waits for me right there. Wives are for breeding. You understand, for making little princes. Come enjoy yourself tonight. You make excellent wine in Sparta. You shouldn\\'t be here. That\\'s what you said last night. Last night was a mistake. And the night before? I\\'ve made many mistakes this week. Do you want me to go? Yes. Where should I go? Away. Far away. I have something for you. Pearls from the Sea of Propontis. They\\'re beautiful. But I can\\'t wear them. Menelaus would kill us both. Don\\'t be afraid of him. I\\'m not afraid of dying. I\\'m afraid of tomorrow. I\\'m afraid of watching you sail away and knowing you\\'ll never come back. Before you came to Sparta, I was a ghost. I walked, and I ate, and I swam in the sea... ...but I was just a ghost. You don\\'t have to fear tomorrow. Come with me. Don\\'t play with me. Don\\'t play. If you come, we\\'ll never be safe. Men will hunt us, the gods will curse us. But I\\'ll love you. Till the day they burn my body... ...I will love you. Tecton. Make the proper offerings to Poseidon before we sail. We don\\'t need any more widows in Troy. Goat or pig? Which does the sea god prefer? I\\'ll wake the priest and ask him. Paris. We should get to bed. We won\\'t sleep on land again for weeks. I have no trouble sleeping on the seas, brother. Athena sings lullabies to me. And who sang lullabies to you tonight? Tonight? Tonight was the fisherman\\'s wife. A lovely creature. I hope you didn\\'t let the fisherman catch you. He was more concerned with the fish. You do understand why we\\'re in Sparta. For peace. And you understand that Menelaus, the king of Sparta... ...is a very powerful man. And that his brother, Agamemnon, the king of Mycenae... ...commands all the Greek forces. What does this have to do with the fisherman\\'s wife? Paris... ...you\\'re my brother and I love you. But if you do anything to endanger Troy... ...I will rip your pretty face from your pretty skull. Now get some sleep. We sail in the morning. A beautiful morning. Poseidon has blessed our voyage. Sometimes the gods bless you in the morning and curse you in the afternoon. Drop sail! Do you love me, brother? Would you protect me against any enemy? The last time you spoke to me like this... ...you were 10 years old, and you\\'d just stolen Father\\'s horse. What have you done now? I must show you something. - Where is she? - Who, my king? I swear by the father of the gods, I will gut you here if you don\\'t tell me! My king! She left. With the Trojans. The fisherman here saw her board their ship. The Trojans? With the young prince, Paris. She... Get my ship ready. Turn us round. Back to Sparta. High on the sail! - Wait, wait. - You fool! - Listen to me. - Do you know what you\\'ve done? Do you know how many years our father worked for peace? I love her. It\\'s all a game to you, isn\\'t it? You roam from town to town, bedding merchants\\' wives and temple mates. You think you know something about love. What about your father\\'s love? You spat on him when you brought her on this ship! What about the love for your country? You\\'d let Troy burn for this woman? I won\\'t let you start a war for her. May I speak? What you\\'re saying is true. I\\'ve wronged you. I\\'ve wronged our father. If you want to take Helen back to Sparta, so be it. But I go with her. To Sparta? They\\'ll kill you. Then I\\'ll die fighting. Oh, and that sounds heroic to you, doesn\\'t it? To die fighting. - Little brother, have you ever killed a man? - No. - Ever seen a man die in combat? - No. I\\'ve killed men, and I\\'ve heard them dying. And I\\'ve watched them dying. And there\\'s nothing glorious about it. Nothing poetic. You say you want to die for love. You know nothing about dying. And you know nothing about love! All the same, I go with her. I won\\'t ask you to fight my war. You already have. To Troy! About ship! Set sail! - I want her back. - Well, of course you do. She\\'s a beautiful woman. I want her back so I can kill her with my own two hands. I won\\'t rest till I\\'ve burned Troy to the ground. I thought you wanted peace with Troy. I should have listened to you. Peace is for the women... ...and the weak. Empires are forged by war. All my life, I\\'ve stood by your side, fought your enemies. You\\'re the elder, you reap the glory. This is the way of the world. But have I ever complained? Have I ever asked you for anything? Never. You\\'re a man of honor. Everyone in Greece knows this. The Trojans spat on my honor. An insult to me is an insult to you. And an insult to me is an insult to all Greeks. Will you go to war with me, brother? I always thought my brother\\'s wife was a foolish woman... ...but she\\'s proved to be very useful. Nothing unifies a people like a common enemy. The Trojans have never been conquered. Some say they can\\'t be conquered. Old King Priam thinks he\\'s untouchable behind his high walls. He thinks the sun god will protect him. But the gods protect only... ...the strong! If Troy falls... ...I control the Aegean. Hector commands the finest army in the east. And Troy is built to withstand a 10-year siege. There won\\'t be a 10-year siege. I\\'ll attack them with the greatest force the world has ever seen. I want all the kings of Greece and their armies. Send emissaries in the morning. One last thing. We need Achilles and his Myrmidons. Achilles. He can\\'t be controlled. He\\'s as likely to fight us as the Trojans. We don\\'t need to control him, we need to unleash him. That man was born to end lives. Yes, he\\'s a gifted killer. But he threatens everything I\\'ve built. Before me, Greece was nothing. I brought all the Greek kingdoms together. I created a nation out of fire worshipers and snake eaters! I build the future, Nestor. Me! Achilles is the past. A man who fights for no flag. A man loyal to no country. How many battles have we won off the edge of his sword? This will be the greatest war the world has ever seen. We need the greatest warrior. There\\'s only one man he\\'ll listen to. I\\'ll send a ship in the morning. Greetings, brother. We were told King Odysseus is hid in the hills. Odysseus? That old bastard drinks my wine and never pays. You ought to respect your king, friend. Respect him? I\\'d like to punch him in the face. He\\'s always pawing at my wife, trying to tear her clothes off. I hope Agamemnon\\'s generals are smarter than his emissaries. What did you say? You want me to help you fight the Trojans. You\\'re... Are you...? Forgive us, King Odysseus. Well... I\\'m gonna miss my dog. King Agamemnon has a favor to ask of you. Of course he does. Never hesitate. Fancy swordplay. Nervous? Petrified. You told me never to change sword hands. Yes. When you know how to use it, you won\\'t be taking my orders. Your reputation for hospitality is fast becoming legend. Patroclus, my cousin. Odysseus, king of Ithaca. Patroclus. I knew your parents well. I miss them. Now you have this one watching over you, eh? Learning from Achilles himself. Kings would kill for the honor. Are you here at Agamemnon\\'s bidding? We need to talk. I will not fight for him. I\\'m not asking you to fight for him. I\\'m asking you to fight for Greece. Have the Greeks tired of fighting each other? - For now. - For the Greeks! The Trojans never harmed me. They insulted Greece. They insulted a man who couldn\\'t hold on to his wife. Is that my business? Your business is war, my friend. Is it? Am I the whore of the battlefield? The man has no honor. I won\\'t be remembered as a tyrant\\'s mercenary. Let Achilles fight for honor. Let Agamemnon fight for power. And let the gods decide which man to glorify. Forget Agamemnon. Fight for me. My wife will feel much better if she knows you\\'re by my side. I\\'ll feel much better. Is Ajax going to fight in Troy? They say he can fell an oak tree with one swing of the ax. Trees don\\'t swing back. We\\'re sending the largest fleet that ever sailed. A thousand ships. A thousand ships? Prince Hector. Is he as good a warrior as they say? The best of all the Trojans. Some say he\\'s better than all the Greeks too. Even if your cousin doesn\\'t come... ...I hope you\\'ll join us. We could use a strong arm like yours. Play your tricks on me, but not my cousin. You have your swords. I have my tricks. We play with the toys the gods give us. We sail for Troy in three days. This war will never be forgotten. Nor will the heroes who fight in it. They say the king of Ithaca has a silver tongue. I knew they would come for you. Long before you were born... ...I knew they would come. They want you to fight in Troy. I\\'m making you another seashell necklace. Like the ones I made you when you were a boy. Do you remember? Mother... ...tonight, I decide. If you stay in L�risa... ...you will find peace. You will find a wonderful woman. You will have sons and daughters, and they will have children. And they will love you. When you are gone, they will remember you. But when your children are dead and their children after them... ...your name will be lost. If you go to Troy... ...glory will be yours. They will write stories about your victories for thousands of years. The world will remember your name. But if you go to Troy... ...you will never come home. For your glory walks hand in hand with your doom. And I shall never see you again. You know this to be true, Mother? I know this. - My son. - Father. Paris. Father. - This is Helen. - Helen? Helen of Sparta? Helen of Troy. I\\'ve heard rumors of your beauty. For once... ...the gossips were right. Welcome. Thank you, good king. Come, you must be tired. Look. He\\'s grown. He is strong. He\\'s just like his father. - Paris! - Briseis! Beloved cousin, your beauty grows with each new moon. Briseis. A servant of Apollo now. The young men of Troy were devastated when Briseis chose the virgin robes. Uncle. I thank the gods for your safe return. - For the gods. - For the gods. For gods. Father... ...I know this is the last thing we need. It is the will of the gods. Everything is in their hands. - But I\\'m surprised you let him bring her. - If I\\'d let him fight Menelaus for her... ...you\\'d be burning a son\\'s body, not welcoming a daughter. We could send peace envoys to Menelaus. You know Menelaus. He\\'d spear their heads to his gate. What would you have me do? Put her on a ship and send her home. Women have always loved Paris, and he has loved them back. But this is different. Something has changed in him. If we send her home to Menelaus, he will follow her. This is my country, and these are my countrymen. I don\\'t want to see them suffer so my brother can have his prize. It\\'s not just the Spartans coming after her. By now, Menelaus has gone to Agamemnon. And Agamemnon has wanted to destroy us for years. Once we\\'re out of the way, he controls the seas. Enemies have been attacking us for centuries. Our walls still stand. Father, we can\\'t win this war. Apollo watches over us. Even Agamemnon is no match for the gods. And how many battalions does the sun god command? Do not mock the gods. When you were very young, you came down with scarlet fever. Your little hand was so hot. The healer said you would not last the night. I went down to Apollo\\'s temple and I prayed until the sun came up. That walk back to the palace was the longest of my life. But I went into your mother\\'s room and you were sleeping in her arms. The fever had broken. I promised that day to dedicate my life to the gods. I will not break my promise. For thirty years I have worked for peace. Thirty years. Paris is a fool sometimes, I know that. But I will fight 1000 wars before letting him die. Forgive me, Father, but you won\\'t be the one fighting. They\\'re coming for me. The wind is bringing them closer. What if we left? Tonight. Right now. What if we went down to the stables, took two horses and left? Ride east, keep riding. - And go where? - Away from here. I could hunt deer, rabbit. I could feed us. But this is your home. You left your home for me. Sparta was never my home. My parents sent my there when I was 16 to marry Menelaus. But it was never my home. We\\'ll live off the land. No more palaces for us. No more servants. We don\\'t need any of that. And your family? We\\'d be protecting my family. If we\\'re not here, what\\'s the need for war? Menelaus won\\'t give up. He\\'ll track us to the end of the world. He doesn\\'t know these lands. I do. We can lose ourselves in a day. You don\\'t know Menelaus. You don\\'t know his brother. They\\'ll burn every house in Troy to find us. They\\'ll never believe we\\'ve left. And even if they do, they\\'ll burn it for spite. Then I\\'ll make it easy for him to find me. I\\'ll walk right up to him and tell him you\\'re mine. You\\'re very young, my love. We\\'re the same age. You\\'re younger than I ever was. Take up your positions! Black sail. It\\'s Achilles. What\\'s the fool doing? He\\'s going to take the beach of Troy with 50 men? Row, Myrmidon, row! My lord? Should we wait for the others? - They brought us here for war. - Yes, but Agamemnon\\'s orders... You fight for me, Eudorus, or Agamemnon? For you, my lord. Then fight for me. And let the servants of Agamemnon fight for him. Make way there! Make way! Tecton, is the Apollonian Guard ready? - Waiting at the city gates. - Good. I\\'ll be right there. Lysander, how long before the army is ready? Half of our men are still coming. We have to arm them... - How long? - Noon. Make it sooner. And, Lysander, I want patrols to scour the countryside. I want every home and pasture checked... ...every Trojan to be brought inside the city walls. If they can\\'t walk, carry them. Patroclus! Put down your spear. - I\\'m fighting the Trojans. - Not today. I\\'m ready. You taught me how to fight. And you\\'re a good student. But you\\'re not a Myrmidon yet. Look at these men. They are the fiercest soldiers in all of Greece. Each of them has bled for me. - Guard the ship. - But this is a war. Cousin, I can\\'t fight the Trojans if I\\'m concerned for you. Guard the ship. Trojans! All my life, I\\'ve lived by a code. And the code is simple: Honor the gods, love your woman... ...and defend your country. Troy is mother to us all. Fight for her! Myrmidons... ...my brothers of the sword. I\\'d rather fight beside you than any army of thousands. Let no man forget how menacing we are. We are lions! Do you know what\\'s there, waiting, beyond that beach? Immortality! Take it! It\\'s yours! Fight positions! Archers! Archers, draw! Draw! Keep forward! Form up! Formation! The man wants to die. On my command! Break off! Break off! Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! Give him the battle, we\\'ll take the war. Give him too many battles and the men will forget who\\'s king. Ajax, you need to see this. Look at him... ...hogging all the glory. Row, you lazy whores, row! Greeks are dying! Row! Those men down there need help. Now! Tecton, with me. I am Ajax, breaker of stones! Look upon me and despair! Flank! To the flank! No! Achilles! Achilles! Back to the city! Back to the city! The sun god is a patron of Troy, our enemy. Take whatever treasure you can find. With your permission, my lord. - Speak. - Apollo sees everything. Perhaps it is not wise to offend him. Warn the men. Wait. You are very brave or very stupid to come after me alone. You must be Hector. Do you know who I am? These priests weren\\'t armed. Yes. There\\'s no honor in cutting old men\\'s throats. Only children and fools fight for honor. I fight for my country. Fight me! Why kill you now, prince of Troy... ...with no one here to see you fall? Why did you come here? They\\'ll be talking about this war for 1000 years. In 1000 years, the dust from our bones will be gone. Yes, prince. But our names will remain. Go home, prince. Drink some wine, make love to your wife. Tomorrow, we\\'ll have our war. You speak of war as if it\\'s a game. How many wives wait at Troy\\'s gates for husbands they\\'ll never see again? Your brother can comfort them. I hear he\\'s good at charming other men\\'s wives. My lord, you let him go? It\\'s too early in the day for killing princes. Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! Achilles! - Achilles. - Ajax. You\\'re as fearless as the gods. I\\'m honored to go to war with you. As am I. If you sailed slower, the war would be over. I\\'ll miss the start as long as I\\'m here at the end. My lord? I\\'ve got something to show you. The men found her hiding in the temple. They thought she\\'d... ...amuse you. What\\'s your name? Did you not hear me? You killed Apollo\\'s priests. I\\'ve killed men in five countries, never a priest. Then your men did. The sun god will have his vengeance. What\\'s he waiting for? The right time to strike. His priests are dead, and his acolyte\\'s a captive. - I think your god is afraid of me. - Afraid? Apollo is master of the sun. He fears nothing. - Where is he? - You\\'re nothing but a killer! You wouldn\\'t know anything about the gods. I know more about the gods than your priests. I\\'ve seen them. You\\'re royalty, aren\\'t you? Spent years talking down to men. You must be royalty. What\\'s your name? Even the servants of Apollo have names. Briseis. Are you afraid, Briseis? Should I be? My lord. Agamemnon requests your presence. The kings are gathering to celebrate the victory. You fought well today. My lord. What do you want here in Troy? You didn\\'t come for the Spartan queen. I want what all men want. I just want it more. You don\\'t need to fear me, girl. You\\'re the only Trojan who can say that. King Triopas, my lord. You have won a great victory, my king of kings. No one thought the Trojan beach could be captured so easily. A beautiful gift, Triopas. You will be among the first to walk in the streets of Troy tomorrow. My father, Neleus, had this urn made to commemorate his victory at Cyparisseis. I present it to you... ...in honor of an even more memorable victory. Thank you, old friend. Tomorrow, we\\'ll eat supper in the gardens of Troy. Leave us. War is young men dying and old men talking. You know this. Ignore the politics. Apparently, you won some great victory. Perhaps you didn\\'t notice. The Trojan beach belonged to Priam in the morning. It belongs to Agamemnon in the afternoon. Have the beach. I didn\\'t come here for sand. No. You came here because you want your name to last through the ages. A great victory was won today. But that victory is not yours. Kings did not kneel to Achilles. Kings did not pay homage to Achilles. Perhaps the kings were too far behind to see. Soldiers won the battle. History remembers kings! Not soldiers. Tomorrow, we\\'ll batter down the gates of Troy. I\\'ll build monuments on every island of Greece. I\\'ll carve \"Agamemnon\" in the stone. My name will last through the ages. Your name is written in sand... ...for the waves to wash away. Be careful, king of kings. First, you need the victory. Your men sacked the temple of Apollo, yes? You want gold? Take it. It\\'s my gift to honor your courage. Take what you wish. I already have. Aphareus! Haemon! The spoils of war. No argument with you, but if you don\\'t release her, you\\'ll never see home again. - Decide. - Guards! Stop! Too many people have died today. If killing is your only talent, that\\'s your curse. I don\\'t want anyone dying for me. Mighty Achilles, silenced by a slave girl. Tonight, I\\'ll have her give me a bath. And then... ...who knows? - You sack of wine! Before my time is done, I will look down on your corpse and smile. If they want a war, we will give them a war. I would match the best of Troy against the best of Greece any day. The best of Greece outnumber the best of Troy two to one. So, what do you suggest? We surrender our city? We allow the Greeks to slaughter our men? Rape our wives? I suggest diplomacy. The Greeks came here for one thing. Let\\'s be honest, my friends. Trojans are now burning on the pyre... ...because of one youthful indiscretion. Glaucus. You have fought with me for 40 years. Can we win this war? Our walls have never been breached. We have the finest archers in the world. And we have Hector... ...whose men would fight the shades of Tartarus if he commanded. Yes, we can win. I spoke with two farmers today. They saw an eagle flying with a serpent clutched in its talons. This is a sign from Apollo. We will win a great victory tomorrow. Bird signs. You want to plan a strategy based on bird signs. Hector, show respect. When Archeptolemus prophesied four years of drought... ...we dug deeper wells. The drought came and we had water to drink. The high priest is a servant of the gods. And I am a servant of Troy. I\\'ve always honored the gods, Father. You know that. But today I fought a Greek who desecrated the statue of Apollo. Apollo didn\\'t strike the man down. The gods won\\'t fight this war for us. There won\\'t be a war. This is not a conflict of nations. It is a dispute between two men. I don\\'t want to see another Trojan die because of me. Paris. Tomorrow morning, I will challenge Menelaus for the right to Helen. The winner will take her home. The loser will burn before nightfall. Does he have a chance? Father... ...I\\'m sorry for the pain I\\'ve caused you. Do you love her? You are a great king because you love your country so much. Every blade of grass. Every grain of sand. Every rock in the river. You love all of Troy. That is the way I love Helen. I\\'ve fought many wars in my time. Some were fought for land, some for power, some for glory. I suppose fighting for love makes more sense than all the rest. But I won\\'t be the one fighting. The sword of Troy. My father carried this sword, and his father before him... ...all the way back to the founding of Troy. The history of our people was written with this sword. Carry it with you tomorrow. The spirit of Troy is in that sword. So long as a Trojan carries it... ...our people have a future. The man who killed Tecton outside Apollo\\'s temple... ...I\\'ve never seen a spear thrown like that. An impossible throw. He has no idea what\\'s happening. Thank the gods. Don\\'t go tomorrow. - Please don\\'t go. - Paris fights tomorrow, not me. Fifty thousand Greeks didn\\'t cross the sea to watch your brother fight. You know this. You\\'d make a fine general, my love. You\\'ve been fighting your whole life. Let other men do battle this time. You know I don\\'t want to fight. I want to see my son grow tall. I want to see the girls chasing after him. Just like they chased his father. He\\'s much more handsome than I ever was. I must see Paris. I lost... ...seven brothers... ...in the Spartan wars. You\\'d think I\\'d be good at losing by now. I can\\'t lose you. I won\\'t survive. Wait. Wait! Helen, what are you doing? - Let me go. - No. I saw them burn. I saw them burning on the pyres. That\\'s my fault. It is. You know it is. All those widows. I still hear them screaming. Their husbands died because I\\'m here. I\\'m going down to the ships. No, you\\'re not. I\\'m giving myself back to Menelaus. He can do what he wants. Kill me, make me his slave, I don\\'t care. Anything is better than this. It\\'s too late for that. Do you think Agamemnon cares about his brother\\'s marriage? This is about power. Not love. Paris is going to fight in the morning. - Yes. - Menelaus will kill him. I won\\'t let that happen. - It\\'s his decision. - No. I can\\'t ask anyone to fight for me. I\\'m no longer queen of Sparta. You\\'re a princess of Troy now... ...and my brother needs you tonight. My lord. The army is marching. Let them march. We stay. But the men are ready. We stay till Agamemnon groans to have Achilles back. As you wish. Are you ready to fight? I am. Are you ready to kill? To take life? At night, I see their faces, all the men I\\'ve killed. They\\'re standing there on the far bank of the River Styx. They\\'re waiting for me. They say, \"Welcome, brother.\" We men are wretched things. I taught you how to fight, but I never taught you why to fight. I fight for you. Who will you fight for when I\\'m gone? Soldiers, they fight for kings they\\'ve never even met. They do what they\\'re told, die when they\\'re told to. Soldiers obey. Don\\'t waste your life following some fool\\'s orders. Go. Are you sure you want to do this? I started this war. Helen... ...sit with me. All my life I have prayed against this day. Yes, my king. Call me Father, dear child. Forgive me, Father... ...for bringing this. I blame you for nothing. Everything is in the hands of the gods. Besides... ...how could I blame anyone for falling in love with Paris? Prepare to halt! Prepare to halt! Halt! Move. Menelaus is a bull. He\\'ll charge you, but keep your distance and use your speed. Brother... ...you don\\'t have to do this. I see you\\'re not hiding behind your high walls. Valiant of you. Ill-advised, but valiant. You come here uninvited. Go back to your ships and go home. We\\'ve come too far, Prince Hector. Prince? What prince? What son of a king would accept a man\\'s hospitality... ...eat his food, drink his wine, then steal his wife in the middle of the night? The sun was shining when your wife left you. She\\'s up there, watching, isn\\'t she? Good. I want her to watch you die. Not yet, brother. Look around you, Hector. I brought all the warriors of Greece to your shores. You can still save Troy, young prince. I have two wishes. If you grant them, no more of your people need die. First, you must give Helen back to my brother. Second, Troy must submit to my command... ...to fight for me whenever I call. You want me to look upon your army and tremble? Well, I see them. I see 50,000 men brought here to fight for one man\\'s greed. Careful, boy. My mercy has limits. And I\\'ve seen the limits of your mercy. And I tell you now, no son of Troy will ever submit to a foreign ruler. Then every son of Troy shall die. There is another way. I love Helen. I won\\'t give her up and neither will you. So let us fight our own battle. The winner takes Helen home. And let that be the end of it. A brave offer, but not enough. Let me kill this little peacock. I didn\\'t come here for your pretty wife. I came here for Troy. I came for my honor. His every breath insults me. Let me kill him. When he\\'s lying in the dust, signal to attack. You\\'ll have your city. I\\'ll have my revenge. So be it. I accept your challenge. And tonight, I\\'ll drink to your bones. - My lord. - Back to the line! Make him swing and miss. He\\'ll tire. Brother... ...if I fall, tell Helen... Tell her... I will. Don\\'t let Menelaus hurt her. If he... You think of your sword and his sword and nothing else. Get up. Come on. See the crows? They never tasted prince before. Is this what you left me for?! Fight! Fight me! You coward! Fight me! We have a pact! Fight! Fight him, son. Fight him. - Fight me! - The Trojans have violated the agreement! Prepare for battle! This is not honor! This is not worthy of royalty! If he doesn\\'t fight, Troy is doomed. Paris. No. No. The fight is over. The fight is not over. Stand back, Prince Hector. I\\'ll kill him at your feet. I don\\'t care. He is my brother. Paris! Go! Go! Get inside, Paris! Archers! - Our men are too close to the walls. - Pull back. Pull back, you fool! For Troy! For Troy! - Now! - Loose! Get them in line! Get the men back into lines! Front line, push! So you\\'re the best of the Trojans. Forward. Forward! Forward! Apollonians! Now! Prince Hector! We need to retreat! My army\\'s never lost a battle yet! You won\\'t have an army if you don\\'t fall back! Back to the ships! - Back to the ships! - Retreat! - Back! - Retreat! Go back! Back. Back to the ships! Fall back! - Men, fall back! - Halt! Halt! But we have them on the run! We\\'re in range of their archers. Have our men gather our fallen. Send an emissary to them. They can collect their dead. Would they have done the same for us? Go! Back! Fall back into line! Before I leave... ...I will burn their city to the ground. Brother, I promise you that. They\\'re laughing at me in Troy. Drunk with victory! They think I\\'ll sail home at first light. Maybe we should. Flee? Like a whipped dog? The men believe we came here for Menelaus\\' wife. Won\\'t be needing her anymore. My brother\\'s blood still wets the sand, and you insult him! It\\'s no insult to say a dead man is dead. If we leave now, we lose all credibility. The Trojans can beat us so easily. How long before the Hittites invade? If we stay, we stay here for the right reasons. To protect Greece, not your pride. Your private battle with Achilles is destroying us. Achilles is one man. Hector is one man. Look what he did to us today. Hector fights for his country! Achilles fights only for himself! I don\\'t care about the man\\'s allegiance. I care about his ability to win battles. He\\'s right. The men\\'s morale is weak. Weak? They\\'re ready to swim home. Even if I could make peace with Achilles, the man won\\'t listen to me! He\\'s as likely to spear me as speak to me! I\\'ll talk to him. He\\'ll want the girl back. He can have that damn girl. I haven\\'t touched her. Where is she? I gave her to the men. They need some amusement after today. Come on, give the bitch to me! Who\\'s first? Trojan whore! What\\'s this? A virgin\\'s robe? You won\\'t be needing that for much longer! Hold her. Come on. Come on. Hold her down. Are you hurt? I watched you fight them. You have courage. To fight back when people attack me? Dog has that kind of courage. Eat. I\\'ve known men like you my whole life. No, you haven\\'t. You think you\\'re so different from 1000 others? Soldiers understand nothing but war. Peace confuses them. - And you hate these soldiers. - I pity them. Trojan soldiers died trying to protect you. Perhaps they deserve more than your pity. Why did you choose this life? - What life? - To be a great warrior. I chose nothing. I was born, and this is what I am. And you? Why did you choose to love a god? I think you\\'ll find the romance one-sided. Do you enjoy provoking me? You\\'ve dedicated your life to the gods. Zeus, god of thunder. Athena, goddess of wisdom. You serve them. - Yes, of course. - And Ares, god of war? Who blankets his bed with the skin of men he\\'s killed? All the gods are to be feared and respected. I\\'ll tell you a secret... ...something they don\\'t teach you in your temple. The gods envy us. They envy us because we\\'re mortal. Because any moment might be our last. Everything\\'s more beautiful because we\\'re doomed. You will never be lovelier than you are now. We will never be here again. I thought you were a dumb brute. I could have forgiven a dumb brute. Do it. Nothing is easier. Aren\\'t you afraid? Everyone dies. Today or 50 years from now. What does it matter? Do it. You\\'ll kill more men if I don\\'t kill you. Many. My lord, there\\'s... Tell the men to start loading the ship. We\\'re going home. Gather the stores. Prepare the ship. Prepare the ship. Agamemnon is a proud man. But he knows when he\\'s made a mistake. The man sends you to make his apologies? What are you doing enthralled to that pig of a king? The world seems simple to you, my friend... ...but when you\\'re a king, very few choices are simple. Ithaca cannot afford an enemy like Agamemnon. Are we supposed to fear him? You don\\'t fear anyone. That\\'s your problem. Fear is useful. We need you back. Greece needs you. Greece got along fine before I was born. Greece will be Greece long after I\\'m dead. I\\'m not talking about the land. The men need you. Stay, Achilles. You were born for this war. Things are less simple today. Women have a way of complicating things. Of all the kings of Greece, I respect you the most. But in this war, you\\'re a servant. Sometimes you have to serve in order to lead. I hope you understand that one day. We\\'re going home? We sail in the morning. Greeks are being slaughtered. We can\\'t just sail away. If it\\'s fighting you still long for, there will always be another war. These are our countrymen. I ate, laughed, mourned with these men while you hid in your tent. You betray all of Greece just to see Agamemnon fall. Someone has to lose. In all my years to come, may my heart never turn as black as yours! We sail in the morning! The omens are gathering. The directive is clear. Fight for your country, that\\'s the only directive. Last time the high priest spoke to us, he prophesied a great victory for Troy. We won a great victory. Let him speak. What course of action do you recommend? The gods favor our cause. Now is the time to destroy the Greek army. Glaucus? Their morale is battered. Hit them now. Hit them hard. And they will run. I must admit, I overestimated the Greeks. They lack discipline and courage. The Myrmidons didn\\'t fight yesterday. There must be dissension among the Greeks. But if we attack their ships, we will unify them. If they decide to attack us, let them. Our walls can\\'t be breached. We\\'ll beat them back again. Yesterday, the Greeks underestimated us. We should not return the favor. You\\'re confident about the meaning of these omens? The desecration of his temple angers Apollo. The gods have cursed the Greeks. Two of their kings have already gone down to the dust. Prepare the army. We attack at daybreak. Father. We\\'re making a mistake. Prepare the army. Come on. Am I still your captive? You\\'re my guest. In Troy, guests can leave whenever they want. You should leave, then. Would you leave this all behind? Would you leave Troy? Hold those barricades! Archers to the rear. Achilles. Achilles. Now! Forward! Enough for one day. Yes. Back to the ships! Back to the ships! It was his cousin. To Troy! Back to the city! To Troy! We were going to sail home today. I don\\'t think anyone\\'s sailing home now. Achilles. You violated my command. No, my lord. There was a mistake. I ordered the Myrmidons to stand down. You led them into combat. I didn\\'t lead them, my lord. We thought you did. Where\\'s Patroclus? Patroclus! We thought he was you, my lord. He wore your armor, your shield, your greaves, your helmet. He even moved like you. Where is he? - Where? - He\\'s dead, my lord. Hector cut his throat. Don\\'t. Don\\'t. Where are you taking me? Do you remember how to get here? Yes. The next time you come here, follow the tunnel. There are no turns, so you can\\'t get lost. Just keep walking. Why? When you get to the end, you\\'ll be by the river. Follow the river until you get to Mount Ida. The Greeks won\\'t go that far inland. Hector. Why are you telling me this? - If I die... - No. If I die, I don\\'t know how long the city will stand. Don\\'t say that. If the Greeks get inside the walls, it\\'s over. They\\'ll kill all the men, throw the babies from the city walls. - Please. - The women, they\\'ll take as slaves. That, for you, will be worse than dying. Why are you saying such things? Because I want you to be ready. I want you to get our boy, and I want you to bring him here. You save as many people as you can, but you get here. And you run. Do you understand? I killed a boy today. And he was young. He was much too young. That boy has just saved this war for us. - Eudorus. - My lord. I need my armor. No. Don\\'t go! Rope! Hector\\'s my cousin. He\\'s a good man. Don\\'t fight him. Please don\\'t fight him. Please. No. Hector! Hector! Hector! Hector! Father... ...forgive me for any offenses. I\\'ve served you as best as I could. Hector! May the gods be with you. Hector. No father ever had a better son. Hector! Apollo guard you, my prince. You\\'re the best man I know. You\\'re a prince of Troy. I know you\\'ll make me proud. Hector! Remember what I told you. You don\\'t have to go. You don\\'t. You remember what I told you. Hector! Hector! I\\'ve seen this moment in my dreams. I\\'ll make a pact with you. With the gods as our witnesses... ...let us pledge that the winner will allow the loser all the proper funeral rituals. There are no pacts between lions and men. Now you know who you\\'re fighting. I thought it was you I was fighting yesterday. And I wish it had been you. But I gave the dead boy the honor he deserved. You gave him the honor of your sword. You won\\'t have eyes tonight. You won\\'t have ears or a tongue. You\\'ll wander the underworld, blind, deaf, and dumb, and all the dead will know: This is Hector, the fool who thought he killed Achilles. Get up, prince of Troy. Get up. I won\\'t let a stone take my glory. You lost your cousin. Now you\\'ve taken mine. When does it end? It never ends. Who are you? I have endured what no one on earth has endured before. I kissed the hands of the man who killed my son. Priam? How did you get in here? I know my own country better than the Greeks, I think. You\\'re a brave man. I could have your head on a spit in the blink of an eye. Do you really think death frightens me now? I watched my eldest son die... ...watched you drag his body behind your chariot. Give him back to me. He deserves the honor of a proper burial. You know that. Give him to me. He killed my cousin. He thought it was you. How many cousins have you killed? How many sons and fathers and brothers and husbands? How many, brave Achilles? I knew your father. He died before his time. But he was lucky not to live long enough to see his son fall. You have taken everything from me. My eldest son... ...heir to my throne... ...defender of my kingdom. I cannot change what happened. It is the will of the gods. But give me this small mercy. I loved my boy from the moment he opened his eyes... ...till the moment you closed them. Let me wash his body. Let me say the prayers. Let me place two coins on his eyes for the boatman. If I let you walk out of here... ...if I let you take him... ...it doesn\\'t change anything. You\\'re still my enemy in the morning. You\\'re still my enemy tonight. But even enemies can show respect. I admire your courage. Meet me outside in a moment. We\\'ll meet again soon, my brother. Your son was the best I\\'ve fought. In my country, the funeral games last for 12 days. It is the same in my country. Then the prince will have that honor. No Greek will attack Troy for 12 days. Briseis? I thought you were dead. You are free. If I hurt you... ...it\\'s not what I wanted. Go. No one will stop you. You have my word. Come, my girl. You\\'re a far better king than the one leading this army. Achilles makes a secret pact, and I have to honor it? What treason is this? Consorting with the enemy king. Giving him 12 days of peace. Peace! Peace! Their prince is dead. Their army is leaderless. This is the time to attack! Even with Hector gone, we have no way to breach their walls. They can wait 10 years for us to leave. I will smash their walls to the ground... ...if it costs me 40,000 Greeks. Hear me, Zeus! I will smash their walls to the ground. That\\'s good. For my son back home. Well, Odysseus. You found a way to make the sheep invite the wolves to dinner. Forgive me, Eudorus. I should never have struck you. You\\'ve been a loyal friend all your life. I hope I never disappoint you again. It\\'s I who have been the disappointment. Rouse the men. You\\'re taking them home. Aren\\'t you coming with us? I have my own battle to fight. Let me march beside you. No. I don\\'t want our men to be a part of this. It\\'s a beautiful night. Go, Eudorus. This is the last order I give you. Fighting for you has been my life\\'s honor, my lord. Open the gates! Open the gates! Here. Plague. Don\\'t go too close, my king. This is the will of the gods. They desecrated the temple of Apollo... ...and Apollo desecrated their flesh. They thought they could come here and sack our city in a day. Now look at them, fleeing across the Aegean. What is this? An offering to Poseidon. The Greeks are praying for a safe return home. I hope the sea god spits in their offering. Lets them all drown at the bottom of the sea. This is a gift. We should take it to the temple of Poseidon. - I think we should burn it. - Burn it? My prince, it\\'s a gift to the gods. The prince is right. I would burn the whole of Greece if I had a big enough torch. I warn you, good men, be careful what you insult. Our beloved Prince Hector had sharp words for the gods... ...and a day later Achilles\\' sword cut him down. Father, burn it. Forgive me, my king, I mean no disrespect... ...but I don\\'t want to see any more sons of Troy... ...incur the gods\\' wrath. I will not watch another son die. Look at them. You\\'d think their prince had never died. You are their prince now. Make your brother proud. Let it burn! Let Troy burn! Burn it! For Menelaus! Burn it! Burn Troy! Burn Troy! I promised you, brother! I promised you! Burn it! Burn it for Menelaus! Briseis. Where is she? - Where? - I don\\'t know. Please. I have a son. Then get him out of Troy. Briseis! Paris! Andromache! Helen. We must go. - Where? - I\\'ll show you. Now. Hurry. Paris. Paris. It\\'s a long way. Quick. We must go now. Briseis! Paris! It\\'s a long way. Quick. Hurry. There\\'s a tunnel. - Come. - I stay. - No. - My father will never abandon the city. I can\\'t leave him. The city is dead. They\\'re burning it to the ground. - What\\'s your name? - Aeneas. - Do you know how to use a sword? - Yes. The sword of Troy. As long as it\\'s in the hands of a Trojan, our people have a future. Protect them, Aeneas. Find them a new home. - I will. - Hurry. Quick. Paris, Paris, Briseis wasn\\'t in her room. I\\'ll find her. Go. - I\\'ll stay with you. - Go. Please don\\'t leave me. - How could you love me if I ran now? - Please. We will be together again, in this world or the next. We will be together. Go. To the gate! Forward! Follow me! Into line! Soldiers of Troy... ...you men are warriors! To lead you has been my honor! My prince! The boatman waits for us. I say we make him wait a little longer! No one. Spare no one. Paris! Save yourself. Briseis! Beware, my friends. I am a servant of the gods. Have you no honor? Have you no honor? I wanted you alive, old man. I wanted you to watch your city burn. Please. The children. Spare the innocents. Nobody\\'s innocent. Nobody. Too late for prayer, priestess. I almost lost this war because of your little romance. I want to taste what Achilles tasted. You\\'ll be my slave in Mycenae. A Trojan priestess scrubbing my floors. And at night... Get up! Hold her. Come with me. No! Paris! No! Don\\'t! Don\\'t! Please! Paris! Don\\'t! It\\'s all right. It\\'s all right. You gave me peace... ...in a lifetime of war. Briseis, come. - Go. - No. You must. No. Troy is falling. - Go. - No. Begin anew. We must go. I know a way out. It\\'s all right. Go. Go. Find peace... ...my brother. If they ever tell my story, let them say... ... I walked with giants. Men rise and fall like the winter wheat... ... but these names will never die. Let them say I lived in the time of Hector... ... breaker of horses. Let them say... ... I lived in the time of Achilles.'\n",

      " 'Sleep v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 1413 (1 December 2009)http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2009/1413.htmlapplications for extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal from the dismissal of two separate appeals from the administrative appeals tribunalveterans\\' entitlement act 1986 (cth) s 35 service pension is means testeddecision of the administrative appeals tribunal and of the primary judge affirmedapplications for extension of time dismissed.practice and procedure The applicant has brought two separate applications for extensions of time within which to appeal from orders of a judge of this Court dismissing two separate appeals from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) and ordering the applicant to pay the costs of those appeals: Sleep v Repatriation Commission [2009] FCA 472.The applicant is a veteran who has rendered eligible war service within the meaning of s 7 of the Veterans\\' Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth) (the Act).As a result of that war service the applicant became incapacitated from a war caused injury or a war caused disease and became eligible for a pension by way of compensation which is to be paid in accordance with the Act: s 13.Part II of the Act deals with pensions other than service pensions: s 12.The applicant has made a claim for a pension under Part II in accordance with s 14 of the Act.Because of the degree of the applicant\\'s disability the applicant is entitled to a special rate of pension pursuant to s 24 of the Act.That special rate of pension is specifically provided for in s 24(4) of the Act and is currently $919.40 per fortnight.The special rate of pension provided for in s 24(4) of the Act is not means tested.All persons who qualify for that special rate of pension are entitled to receive the sum provided for in s 24(4) which, as I have said, is currently $919.40.Part III of the Act deals with service pensions: s 35.A service pension includes an invalidity service pension: s 5Q.The applicant is also entitled to an invalidity service pension.Section 37 of the Act provides that \"a person is eligible for an invalidity service pension if the person is a veteran and has rendered qualifying service and is permanently incapacitated for work in accordance with a determination under section 37AA\": s 37(1)(c).Section 37AA obligates the respondent to specify by written determination the circumstances in which persons are permanently incapacitated for work for the purposes of s 37(1)(c) of the Act.The Commission determined by legislative instrument (the Veterans\\' Entitlements (Invalidity Service Pension --- Permanent Incapacity for Work) Determination 1999 (Cth)) that a person is \"permanently incapacitated for work for the purposes of s 37(1)(c) where they are ... a veteran to whom s 24 of the Act applies\".Thus the applicant is entitled to a Part III invalidity service pension because he is a veteran to whom s 24 applies.The Act does not directly fix the rate at which an invalid service pension is payable.Service pensions payable under Part III are, unlike pensions payable under Part II, means tested.The rate of pension payable to any particular eligible person will depend upon that person\\'s assets and income.Section 37N of the Act provides that a veteran\\'s invalidity service pension rate is to be worked out in accordance with the Rate Calculator: s 37N.The Rate Calculator is defined in s 5Q of the Act to mean the Rate Calculator in Part 2 of Schedule 6 of the Act.Part 2 of Schedule 6 of the Act provides that the rate of service pension for a person in the circumstances of the appellant is worked out in accordance with Method statement 1.Method statement 1 provides for an 11 step process to determine the person\\'s rate of service pension.The first 4 steps (which need not be identified) result in an assessment for the particular person of the \"maximum payment rate\".Step 5 requires the respondent to apply the ordinary/adjusted income test using Module E to work out the reduction for ordinary/adjusted income.After making that reduction the result is the income reduced rate: Step 6.In that way a person\\'s rate of service pension (a Part III pension) is means tested for that person\\'s income.Step 7 of Method statement 1 requires the respondent then to apply the assets test using Module F to work out the reduction in the income reduced rate for the person\\'s assets.Step 1 of Module F requires the respondent to work out the value of the person\\'s assets which is done in accordance with SCH6-F2 and in doing so have regard to s 52 of the Act for the assets that are to be disregarded in valuing the person\\'s assets.Section 52 of the Act identifies those assets which are to be disregarded in calculating the value of a person\\'s assets.Relevantly, s 52(1)(f), (k) and (l) provides:   (1) In calculating the value of a person\\'s assets for the purposes of this Act ... disregard the following:      ...       (f) the value of the person\\'s investment in:        (i) a superannuation fund; or (ii) an approved deposit fund; or (iii) a deferred annuity; or (iiia) an ATO small superannuation account; until the person: (iv) reaches pension age; or (v) commences to receive a pension or annuity out of the fund.       ...       (k) if:        (i) personal property of the person is designed for use by a disabled person; and (ii) the person, the person\\'s partner or a child who is dependent on the person or the person\\'s partner is disabled; the value of the property.       (l) if:        (i) personal property of the person is modified so that it can be used by a disabled person; and (ii) the person, the person\\'s partner or a child who is dependent on the person or the person\\'s partner is disabled; the part of the value of the property that is attributable to the modifications;        ...    Relevantly, for the purpose of these applications, the value of a person\\'s investment in a superannuation fund is to be disregarded in calculating the value of that person\\'s assets until the person either reaches pension age or commences to receive a pension or annuity out of the fund.Pension age in relation to a veteran has the meaning given by s 5QA: s 5Q.Section 5QA(2) provides that a man reaches pension age when he turns 60 years.Thus the value of a veteran\\'s investment in a superannuation fund is disregarded for the purpose of calculating the value of the veteran\\'s assets only whilst the veteran (male) is under the age of 60.Thereafter, any investment in any superannuation fund is not disregarded in calculating the value of the veteran\\'s assets for the purpose of s 52.Paragraphs (k) and (l) of s 52(1) apply only to personal property and have no application to real estate.In any event, those paragraphs only apply to personal property which is designed for use or is modified so it can be used by a disabled person.Paragraphs (k) and (l) of s 52(1) therefore only apply in limited circumstances to personal property.The respondent has made two relevant decisions in relation to the applicant.First, on 5 July 2004 it reduced the applicant\\'s rate of service pension with effect from 20 July 2004 to reflect the applicant\\'s ownership of a property situated at Port Road, Croydon to which the respondent ascribed a value of $140,000.Secondly, the respondent made a decision on 13 August 2007 to reduce the applicant\\'s rate of pension from 26 August 2007 to reflect superannuation products owned by the applicant at that time.The applicant turned 60 on 26 August 2007.The applicant sought a review by the AAT of both those decisions.On 10 December 2008, in Sleep v Repatriation Commission [2008] AATA 1100 , the AAT made the following decision:   The Repatriation Commission decision of 5 July 2004, as affirmed by a review officer on 10 August 2007, which reduced Mr Sleep\\'s rate of service pension with effect from 20 July 2004 in reflection of an assets test which included the value of property at $140,000, is affirmed.  Again on 10 December 2008, in Sleep v Repatriation Commission [2008] AATA 1101 , the AAT made the following decision:   The decision of the Repatriation Commissioner dated 13 August 2007, as affirmed by a decision of a review officer dated 19 March 2008, which reduced Mr Sleep\\'s rate of pension from 26 August 2007, is affirmed.  It is from those two decisions that the applicant appealed to a judge of this Court pursuant to s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth).The appeals were heard together and the orders dismissing those appeals were made on 12 May 2009.It was not until 3 September 2009 that the applicant made an application for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal.Even then one application only was made in respect of both matters.Later the applicant regularised the applications by bringing separate applications for an extension of time.It was agreed that I should consider his application for an extension of time in relation to both matters as if both had been brought as at 3 September 2009.The applicant deposed to the circumstances surrounding the delay in bringing the appeals.Two days after the primary judge announced his orders the applicant took his wife and daughter on a trip to North Queensland.He said that he had promised to take his wife the year before but she had been diagnosed with bowel cancer and had to undergo surgery and chemotherapy.He said he had promised her he would take her in 2009 and was not prepared to disappoint her and delay the trip because of the state of her health.He said that they did not return to Adelaide until 9 August 2009 and his wife underwent further treatment which culminated in emergency treatment on 30 August 2009.At the trial he tendered a certificate which showed that his wife is presently in palliative care in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital.It was his wife\\'s illness and separate illnesses suffered by himself and his daughter that caused the delay in filing a notice of appeal from the primary judge\\'s orders.Order 52 rule 15(2) allows the Court to give leave to file and serve a notice of appeal at any time if special reasons exist: O 52 r 15(2).I would extend the time within which the applicant could appeal to the date when he filed his applications for an extension of time to appeal from the separate orders made by the primary judge, if I was satisfied that the applicant had some prospects of successfully prosecuting his appeal.However, for the reasons which follow, in my opinion there are no prospects of the applicant succeeding on the appeals and, in those circumstances, it would be inappropriate to grant either of the applications.The applicant is the owner of the Croydon property and takes no issue with the value ascribed to it of $140,000.On 26 August 2007 he turned 60 years of age and at that time held three superannuation products.For the purpose of assessing his pension under Part III of the Act, that is the invalidity service pension, the respondent is obliged to take into account the veteran\\'s assets except those assets which are excluded by operation of s 52.Real estate owned by a veteran is not to be disregarded in calculating the value of the veteran\\'s assets.Mr Sleep argued that paragraphs (k) and (l) of s 52 applied but, clearly, that argument must be rejected for two reasons.First, those paragraphs only apply to personal property.Secondly, those paragraphs only apply to personal property which has been designed or modified for use by a disabled person.The respondent was right to assess the amount of the applicant\\'s invalidity service pension by reference to his ownership of the Croydon property.The AAT was also right to affirm that decision.The primary judge was right in concluding that the appeal from that decision should be dismissed.There is no prospect that the applicant could persuade the Full Court that that asset should not be taken into account in assessing the rate of his veteran\\'s invalidity service pension.The decision of the Commission made on 5 July 2004 is unquestionably right.Prior to the applicant reaching pension age, the value of the applicant\\'s investment in any superannuation fund was an asset which had to be disregarded in calculating the value of the applicant\\'s assets: s 52(1)(5)(iv).However, when he reached the pension age, which he did when he turned 60 on 26 August 2007, his investment in superannuation was no longer an asset which had to be disregarded in calculating the applicant\\'s invalid service pension: s 52(1)(f)(iv).Again, in my opinion the decision of the Repatriation Commission of 5 July 2004 was correct, as was the decision of the AAT affirming that decision on 10 December 2008.The primary judge also, in my respectful opinion, rightly dismissed the applicant\\'s appeal from the decision of the AAT.In my opinion, the applicant has no prospects of successfully persuading the Full Court that his Honour erred in relation to his order dismissing that appeal.The applicant was unrepresented.He clearly feels aggrieved by the scheme of the legislation and the manner in which the respondent administers the legislation.He did not apparently understand that that part of his pension which is payable by reason of s 24 is determined by Parliament pursuant to s 24(4) and not means tested, but that the invalidity service pension which is payable by reason of s 37 is means tested.Because there is no prospect of the applicant succeeding on appeal, the applications for an extension of time within which to file a notice of appeal must be dismissed.I certify that the preceding thirty-eight (38) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the

and  (b) is not a designated commercial electronic message.Section 16 also provides for a number of justifications only one which it is presently necessary to note --- consent: s 16(2) of the Spam Act .ACMA is a public authority of the Commonwealth established by s 6 of the Australian Communications and Media Authority Act 2005 (Cth).Its telecommunications related functions are set out in s 8(1) of that Act.Materially, they include:  8(1) The ACMA\\'s telecommunications functions are as follows: (a) to regulate telecommunications in accordance with the Telecommunications Act 1997 and the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 ;  (b) to advise and assist the telecommunications industry;  (c) to report to and advise the Minister in relation to the telecommunications industry;  (d) to report to and advise the Minister in relation to matters affecting consumers, or proposed consumers, of carriage services;  (e) to manage Australia\\'s input into the setting of international standards for telecommunications (except so far as Standards Australia International Limited is responsible for managing that input);  (f) to monitor, and report to the Minister on, all significant matters relating to the licensing of carriers under the Telecommunications Act 1997 ;  (g) to make available to the public information about matters relating to the telecommunications industry;  (h) to conduct public educational programs about matters relating to the telecommunications industry;  (i) to give advice to the public about matters relating to the telecommunications industry;  (j) such other functions as are conferred on the ACMA by or under:  (i) the Spam Act 2003 ; or  (ia) the Do Not Call Register Act 2006 ; or  (ii) the Telecommunications Act 1997 ; or  (iii) the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Charges) Act 1997 ; or  (iv) the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 (other than subsection 158F(1)); or  (iva) chapter 4 or 5 of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 ; or  (v) the Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Act 1997 ; or  (vi) part XIC of the Trade Practices Act 1974 ;  (k) to monitor, and to report to the Minister on, the operation of each Act specified in paragraph (j), to the extent it is so specified;  (l) to do anything incidental to or conducive to the performance of any of the above functions.One of the functions conferred on ACMA by the Spam Act is the bringing of proceedings for civil penalties and injunctive relief in respect of contraventions of that Act.Section 26 of the Spam Act provides for the institution of civil penalty proceedings.As to injunctive relief, final injunctive relief may be granted by this Court pursuant to s 32 of the Spam Act .Section 33 of the Spam Act makes separate provision for the granting by this Court of interim injunctions.Those two sections provide:  Section 32   Restraining injunctions  (1) If a person has engaged, is engaging or is proposing to engage, in any conduct in contravention of a civil penalty provision, the Federal Court may, on the application of the ACMA, grant an injunction: (a) restraining the person from engaging in the conduct; and  (b) if, in the Court\\'s opinion, it is desirable to do so---requiring the person to do something. Performance injunctions  (2) If: (a) a person has refused or failed, or is refusing or failing, or is proposing to refuse or fail, to do an act or thing; and  (b) the refusal or failure was, is or would be a contravention of a civil penalty provision;   the Federal Court may, on the application of the ACMA, grant an injunction requiring the person to do that act or thing.  Section 33   Interim injunctions   Grant of interim injunction   (1) If an application is made to the Federal Court for an injunction under section 32 , the Court may, before considering the application, grant an interim injunction restraining a person from engaging in conduct of a kind referred to in that section.  No undertakings as to damages   (2) The Federal Court is not to require an applicant for an injunction under section 32 , as a condition of granting an interim injunction, to give any undertakings as to damages  Section 36 of the Spam Act should also be noted and is as follows:  Section 36 Other powers of the Federal Court unaffected   The powers conferred on the Federal Court under this Part are in addition to, and not instead of, any other powers of the Court, whether conferred by this Act or otherwise  On the strength of the contraventions which it alleges, ACMA seeks both the imposition of civil penalties and the granting of final injunctive relief in these proceedings.To support its claim for final injunctive relief, ACMA also calls in aid the jurisdiction conferred on the Court by s 80 of the TPA.At the present stage of these proceedings, the question is whether and in what terms interlocutory injunctive relief should be granted, or whether undertakings which have been proffered by particular Respondents should be regarded as a sufficient answer to the claim for interlocutory injunctive relief.So far as some of the Respondents are concerned, no controversy attends that question.That is because ACMA does not seek against those Respondents to press its claim for interlocutory injunctive relief having regard to the terms of the undertaking they offer.That is not so in respect of the following Respondents: Winning Bid Pty Ltd (Winning - the Second Respondent); Mr SA Owen (the Fourth Respondent); Mr TA Salcedo (the Fifth Respondent); and Mr GC Maughan (the Seventh Respondent).I shall refer collectively to these Respondents as the \"remaining Respondents\".I annex to these reasons the terms in which the remaining Respondents have, without admission as to liability to civil penalty, proffered undertakings to the Court, which undertakings became Exhibit 1.For its part, ACMA has submitted that only an undertaking cast in rather wider terms would sufficiently meet its claim for interlocutory injunctive relief.I also annex to these reasons a copy of what ACMA submits would be a sufficient undertaking.The remaining Respondents are not prepared to give an undertaking in these terms.ACMA therefore seeks interlocutory injunctive relief in terms of the rebuffed undertaking.At the risk of overgeneralising what is a highly detailed pleading supported by extensive affidavit evidence, ACMA alleges: (a) Winning and Mobilegate sent, are sending, and are likely to continue to send unsolicited commercial electronic messages in contravention of s16(1) of the Spam Act and that Jobspy, Simon Owen, Tarek Salcedo, Scott Moles and Glenn Maughan were knowingly concerned in the sending of those unsolicited messages; (b) the modus operandi of IMP, Winning and Mobilegate in the sending of the unsolicited messages involved the deliberate creation, registration and use of fabricated profiles on dating websites for the purposes of soliciting, by deception, mobile phone numbers from members of the dating websites for use in the business constituted by the supply of the sale divert, singles club and maybemeet services; (c) Winning and Mobilegate, with the knowledge involvement of the individual respondents, have consistently failed to address complaints about the deceptive use of the fabricated profiles and the lack of consent for the sending of the unsolicited messages and have sought to conceal from the aggregator, dealing with customer, carriage service provider and TIO complaints, the true nature of the respective sms businesses.ACMA submits that, in order effectively to protect the public from ongoing conduct of the kind alleged in its statement of claim, broad injunctive relief even at an interlocutory stage is required having regarding to what it alleges is an interchangeable use, made by the individuals of the Respondents, of different corporate entities and the inability of those corporate entities to provide documentation of the acts performed in the course of their SMS businesses.The principles which inform whether or not to grant interlocutory injunctive relief are not in doubt.They are as stated by Gummow and Hayne JJ in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O\\'Neill (2006) 227 CLR 571 at 81-82, [65]: The relevant principles in Australia are those explained in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd.This Court (Kitto, Taylor, Menzies and Owen JJ) said that on such applications the court addresses itself to two main inquiries and continued: \"The first is whether the plaintiff had made out a prima facie case, in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to relief ...The second inquiry is ... whether the inconvenience or injury which the plaintiff would be likely to suffer if an injunction were refused outweighs or is outweighed by the injury which the defendant would suffer if an injunction were granted.\"  By using the phrase \"prima facie case\", their Honours did not mean that the plaintiff must show that it is more probable than not that at trial the plaintiff will succeed likelihood of success to justify in the circumstances the preservation of the status quo pending the trial.That this was the sense in which the Court was referring to the notion of a prima facie case is apparent from an observation to that effect made by Kitto J in the course of argument.With reference to the first inquiry, the Court continued, in a statement of central importance for this appeal:  \"How strong the probability needs to be depends, no doubt, upon the nature of the rights [the plaintiff] asserts and the practical consequences likely to flow from the order he seeks.\"   [footnotes omitted]. Given that a question arises as to whether or not undertakings should be accepted, reference should also be made to the guidance offered by Gibbs CJ, Stephen, Mason and Wilson JJ in their joint judgment in Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1981] HCA 48 ; (1980-1981) 148 CLR 150 at 164-165:  An undertaking to the court is given in lieu of an injunction and, if broken, is treated as the equivalent of an order for the purpose of enforcement; it may therefore be enforced in the same manner as an injunction --- Milburn v Newton Colliery Ltd; London and Birmingham Railway Co v Grand Junction Canal Co; In re National Federated Electrical Association\\'s Agreement; Biba Ltd v Stratford Investments Ltd.   As an undertaking is given in lieu of an injunction and is enforceable in like manner, the principles which govern the grant of an injunction by a court must guide it in deciding whether it should accept an undertaking.Limitations which affect the court\\'s jurisdiction or power to grant a final injunction must be observed in the acceptance of an undertaking when it is offered as a substitute for a final injunction.The court cannot escape such limitations by the expedient of accepting an undertaking in lieu of an injunction.The court cannot put itself in the position of enforcing conduct which it has no capacity to command or compel.No doubt the Federal Court has power to accept an undertaking at an interlocutory stage when the undertaking is reasonably related to the orderly procedure of the Court or to the subject matter of the litigation, ... even though it is not in a form which falls within s 80.But, ... this does not justify the conclusion that the Court has power to accept an undertaking by way of final disposition of the case when the Court lacks power to make a final order in that form and the effect of the undertaking is to restrain conduct which the Court has no power to restrain.  In general the court must, in deciding whether it will accept from a defendant an undertaking to which the plaintiff takes no exception, be guided by the principles which apply to the making of a consent injunction ...   [footnotes omitted]  The remaining Respondents do not contest, for the present purposes, that ACMA has demonstrated a prima facie case in the sense described in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O\\'Neill (2006) 224 CLR 571 in respect of the allegations I have summarised above.They submit though that the interlocutory relief sought by ACMA goes beyond that which is reasonably necessary in the circumstances pending trial.More particularly they submit: (a) ACMA offers no undertaking as to damages.They acknowledge it is not required to do so insofar as it applies for injunctive relief under the Spam Act s 33.They note it has no similar protection insofar as it relies on s 80 of the Trade Practices Act .Even insofar as ACMA cannot be required to give an undertaking, they submit it is still a relevant consideration that such protection is absent; (b) ACMA has substantially delayed in seeking relief.The substantial delay was before the commencement of proceedings in late 2008.It is apparent from ACMA\\'s affidavit material that it has been investigating and has been in possession of much of the information on which it relies for some time.This suggests, they submit that things are not a drastic as it now seeks to make out; (c) The interlocutory injunctive relief sought by ACMA is in essentially the same form as the final injunctive relief which it seeks.In many respects, its effect will be final.No attempt has been made to confine the relief given its interlocutory nature.As a result, they submit some of the interlocutory relief sought is not appropriate; (d) The Court will be astute to ensure that orders are not made which have the potential to constrain conduct which is not the subject of complaint in the Statement of Claim.Several of the orders sought, they submit, have that potential, particularly so as to prohibit businesses which might lawful be conducted.I turn now to a consideration of these particular submissions by the remaining Respondents.Subsection 80(6) of the TPA is in similar terms to and perhaps provided the inspiration for s 33(2) of the Spam Act (set out above).However, those who enjoy the benefit of s 80(6) are the Minister administering the TPA and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).This case illustrates that the ACCC is not the only Commonwealth public authority whose functions can embrace the seeking of interim injunctive relief under the TPA in the public interest.That omission might well be though a law reform matter by the Parliament.Be this as it may, ACMA submits that, having regarding to its functions and the purpose of the proceedings, the Court would not regard its failure to offer the usual undertaking as to damages as fatal to so much of its claim for interlocutory injunctive relief as depends upon the TPA.There is no doubt that in suits brought by private litigants the offering of the usual undertaking as to damages is normally expected by the Court before interlocutory injunctive relief is granted.The present form of the usual undertaking as to damages is to be found in Practice Note Number 3 issued by the Chief Justice on 14 June 1999.Section 64 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) provides, materially, \"in any suit to which the Commonwealth ... is a party, the rights of the parties shall as nearly as possible be the same, and judgment may be given and costs awarded on either side, as in a suit between subject and subject\".This to me evidences an intention by the Parliament that, in a case which might truly be assimilated with a suit between subject and subject, a Commonwealth public authority seeking an interlocutory injunction would ordinarily have to give the usual undertaking as to damages in order to secure such relief.This though is not a proceeding which might be assimilated with a suit between subject and subject.It is not ACMA\\'s status as a Commonwealth public authority which prevents that assimilation but rather the particular function which it is discharging as a public authority.That function is to seek the enforcement of particular statutes in the public interest.Such sentiments are evident in the speech of Lord Cross in F Hoffman --- la roche &amp; Co AG &amp; Ors v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1975] AC 295 at 371:  \"... if the Crown is taking proceedings under a statutory provision ... the court in considering whether or not to make the grant of an interim injunction conditional of the giving of an undertaking in damages has to bear in mind the interest which the public --- and in particular any section of it which will benefit directly thereby --- has in seeing that the law in question is enforced.Authorities in this country which evidence a similar position are Australian Securities and Investments Commission v ACN 102 556 098 Pty Ltd (2003) 48 ACSR 350 at 352 and Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v Mansfield &amp; Ors [2006] WASC 225 at [14] .I do not therefore regard the absence of any undertaking as to damages by the ACMA as fatal to its claim for interlocutory injunctive relief insofar as that claim relies upon the TPA.That is not to say that the absence of an undertaking as to damages is irrelevant.It is a fact to take into account, particularly where, even at an interlocutory stage, the injunctive relief sought, would, if granted, preclude a respondent engaging in commercial activity beyond that which is the subject of particular complaint in the proceedings.ACMA submits that, in an appropriate case, this Court\\'s jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief under s 80 of the TPA does extend to prohibiting a person from engaging altogether in a particular field of commercial activity or industry if that is required to protect the public from conduct of the kind which constituted the contravention of that Act found by the Court.A Full Court of this Court has held as much: Foster v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2006] FCAFC 21 ; (2006) 149 FCR 135 at 149, [35] .Foster concerned final injunctive relief granted in circumstances which were sufficiently serious to move the trial judge to impose what he regarded as a pecuniary penalty \"at the high end of the scale\".Accepting though, as I conceive I must, that s 80 confers such a power in respect of injunctive relief, the facts would, in my opinion, have to be very singular and serious indeed and an applicant\\'s case overwhelming to warrant the granting of relief of such breadth.There is a basis, apparent from the affidavits of Mr SJ Weber, ACMA\\'s senior investigator in this matter, for believing that, either or each of Messrs Salcedo and Maughan, on behalf of Mobilegate, have provided a provisioning form for the provision of a premium short code 19724253 for use in a subscription service known as \"Australian Singles On-line\" and of an additional short code 19753787.ACMA, so Mr Weber deposes, has received and continues to receive complaints from mobile phone users and dating website operators in relation to the short code 19724253.Mr Weber also deposes to the current use of additional short codes allocated to Mobilegate and Winning respectively, apparently being used for the sending of messages of the kind referred to in the statement of claim.There has been no affidavit material read on behalf of any of the remaining the Respondents as to these matters.Their solicitor has though deposed to the conduct of a business by Winning known as \"Winning Bid Reverse Auction\".That business is said to be independent from the activities the subject of the present proceedings.ACMA does not submit otherwise.Indeed, it seeks to exclude from the purview of any interlocutory injunctive relief anything which would prevent Winnings conducting that particular business.It is naturally a concern that, notwithstanding the institution of proceedings, conduct which may contravene either or each of the TPA and the Spam Act may be continuing.I also note that some at least of the remaining Respondents have earlier been the subject of proceedings in respect of similar conduct to that complained of.I remind myself though that a trial has yet to occur and the remaining Respondents have not therefore had the opportunity thus presented for a comprehensive challenge whether by cross-examination or contradictory evidence or both to ACMA\\'s case.It seems to me that the present state of the evidence warrants the granting of interlocutory injunctive relief but not of the breadth proposed by ACMA.The delay to which the remaining Respondents point is principally that which preceded the institution of proceedings late last year.I do not regard that as a material basis for refusing interlocutory injunctive relief in this case.Prima facie, Mr Weber\\'s affidavits show a continuum of conduct.Further, it is quite apparent from his affidavits that there has necessarily been both an intensive and extensive investigation in order to bring matters to the point where they were fit for the institution of proceedings in this Court.It is to be remembered that, though a criminal standard of proof is not required in order to find contraventions which sound in civil penalties, nonetheless inexact proofs and indirect references are not sufficient: Brigginshaw v Brigginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336.I have already passed comment as to the breadth of the interlocutory injunctive relief sought by ACMA.It is a serious thing at a such stage of a proceeding to interfere with the lawful conduct of a business or with the ability lawfully to institute other businesses.Subject to one qualification, I consider that the undertakings proffered by the remaining Respondents sufficiently meet the case for interlocutory injunctive relief that ACMA has established.That qualification relates to Winning\\'s undertaking only that it will \"use reasonable endeavours\" to remove or otherwise deactivate, or cause to be removed or deactivated, any fictitious profiles on dating websites or social networking websites it has registered or otherwise placed on those websites, whether by itself, its servants or agents.Winning seems, prima facie , to have control in respect of such websites.ACMA, in my opinion, has established a case for an interlocutory order that Winning remove or deactivate the websites concerned.If it transpires, for some unforeseen reason, that Winning cannot, notwithstanding what it shows to be endeavours which the Court regards as reasonable effect removal or deactivation, it and its officers would not be found guilty of a contempt.That though is to anticipate.Further, what, prospectively, amounts to \"reasonable endeavours\" may be a subject upon which reasonable people might reasonably differ.It is undesirable, in my opinion, that that degree of imprecision attend either an interlocutory injunction or an undertaking which upon acceptance will have the same practical effect.I therefore propose to grant an interlocutory injunction in terms of paragraph 4 of the remaining Respondents\\' undertakings but with the qualification as to reasonable endeavours removed.Subject to that, I regard the undertakings as sufficiently meeting the claim for interlocutory injunctive relief.I should add that, contrary to ACMA\\'s submission, I do not regard apprehended burdens of monitoring as a sufficient basis for prohibiting the remaining Respondents from engaging what would, absent a court order, otherwise be lawful conduct.Those monitoring difficulties strike me as no different to those which attend ACMA\\'s operations in the day to day discharge of its functions in relation to contraventions of the Act.I do not regard it as telling against the remaining Respondents that they have not adduced evidence of financial or other burdens which would attend their complying with interlocutory orders of the kind sought by ACMA.That there is no such evidence is relevant in terms of an assessment of the balance of convenience but it is not the law that ACMA is entitled to interlocutory injunctive relief of any kind unless a respondent proves otherwise.I shall hear the parties in relation to directions for the further conduct of the proceedings.I certify that the preceding thirty-four (34) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Logan.Associate:  Dated: 22 May 2009  Counsel for the Applicant: Mr S Couper QC with Ms M Brennan   Solicitor for the Applicant: Australian Government Solicitor   Counsel for the First, Third and Sixth Respondents: Ms K Mellifont   Solicitor for the First, Third and Sixth Respondents: Herbert Greer   Counsel for the Second, Fourth, Fifth and Seventh Respondents: Mr D Clothier   Solicitor for the Second, Fourth, Fifth and Seventh Respondents: Axis Legal  Date of Hearing: 21 May 2009   Date of Judgment: 22 May 2009              AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback  URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2009/539.html   '\n",

That fairagain unsay. Demetrius lovesyourfair. O...happy fair! Sickness is catching. O,were favorso, yourswould I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go. O,teach me howyou look, and withwhatart you swaythe motion ofDemetrius\\' heart. His folly, Helena, is no faultofmine. None butyourbeauty. Would that faultwere mine! Take comfort. He no more shall see my face. Lysanderand myself shall flythis place. Helen... to you ourmindswe will unfold. Tomorrownight, when Phoebe doth behold hersilvervisage in the wateryglass, a time thatlovers\\' flights doth still conceal, through Athens gates have we devised to steal. And thence from Athens turn away oureyes to seek new friends and strangercompanies. Egeus: Hermia! Ohh. Hermia! Farewell, sweetplay fellow. Praythou forus, and good luck grantthee thy Demetrius. Egeus: Hermia! Ohh. Keep word, Lysander. I will, my Hermia. Helena, adieu. Asyou on him, Demetrius dote on you. Oh...spite! Oh, hell. [Church Bells Tolling ] [ Italian Operatic Singing ] Ah, buon giorno! [Speaking Italian ] Is all ourcompanyhere? Here, PeterQuince. Bestto call them generally, man byman, according to the scrip. [ Laughing ] Come here, here. Here is the scroll of everyman\\'s name which is thought fit through all ourtown to playin ourinterlude before the duke and duchess on hiswedding day atnight. But first, good PeterQuince, saywhatthe playtreats on, then read the names ofthe actors, and so growto a point. Marry, ourplayis The Most Lamentable Comedy and Cruel Death ofPyramus and Thisby. Averygood piece ofwork, I assure you, and a merry. Now, good PeterQuince, call forthyouractors bythe scroll. Masters... spread yourselves. So, uh, answeras I call you. Nick Bottom the weaver. Ready. Name whatpart I am for, and proceed. You, Nick Bottom, are setdown for Pyramus. Whatis Pyramus? Aloverora tyrant? He\\'s a lover thatkills himself, most gallant, forlove. All:Ahh. Thatwill ask some tears in the true performing ofit. IfI do it, letthe audience look to theireyes. I will move storms. I will condole in some measure. Now,to the rest. Quince:Well-- Yet, my chiefhumor is fora tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, ora partto teara catin, to make all split. Francis Flute-- The raging rocks and shivering shocks shall break the locks ofprison gates, and Phibbus\\' car shall shine from far and...make and mar the foolish fates. Ha ha ha. Thiswas lofty. Ha ha. Uh, ahem, Pyramus. Uh, Francis Flute the bellows-mender. Here, PeterQuince. Francis Flute, you musttake Thisby on you. Whatis Thisby? Awandering knight? He\\'s the lady that Pyramus mustlove. [ Laughing ] Nay, faith, letnotme play a woman. I have a beard coming. And I mayhide my face, letme playThisby,too. Ohh-- I\\'ll speak in a monstrous little voice: \"Thisne,Thisne!\" Ah, Pyramus, myloverdear, thyThisby dear, and lady dear!\" Ohh! No, no, you mustplay Pyramus. Snout... and Flute,you Thisby. [Applause ] Robin Starveling the tailor. Here, PeterQuince. Ah,well... Snug the joiner, youthe lion\\'s part. Ahh. And I hope we have a playwell fitted. Have you the lion\\'s partwritten? Prayyou, ifitbe, give itme, for I am slow ofstudy. No,you may do itextempore, foritis nothing butroaring. Roar! Roar! Letme playthe lion,too. I will roarthat I will do anyman\\'s heart good to hearme. I will roarthat I will make the duke say, \"Lethim roaragain. Lethim roaragain!\" Butyou should do it too terribly, thatyouwould fright the duchess and the ladies, and theywould shriek. And thatwere enough to hang us all. I grantyou, friends, ifI should frightthe ladies outoftheirwits, theywould have no more discretion butto hang us. But I will aggravate myvoice so that I will roaryou as gently as anysucking dove; I will roaryou an \\'twere anynightingale. [Quietly Roaring ] [ Laughing ] [ Dog Barking ] Aah-- [ Laughing ] You can playno part but Pyramus. Pyramus is a sweet-faced man, a properman as one shall see in a summer\\'s day, a mostlovely gentlemanlike man. Therefore you must needs play Pyramus. Well... I will undertake it. Masters, you have all yourparts, and I am to entreatyou to con them bytomorrownight and to meetin the palace wood, a mile withoutthe town. There will we rehearse. Ifwe meetin the city, we will be dogged by company and ourdevices known. Prayyou fail me not. We will meet and there we mayrehearse mostobscenely and courageously. Take pains. Be perfect. Adieu. [ Italian Operatic Singing ] [Sighs ] [Thunder ] [Thunder ] Ere Demetrius looked on Hermia\\'s eyne, he hailed down oaths thathe was onlymine. And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt, so he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt. I will go tell him offair Hermia\\'s flight. Then to the wood thisverynight will he pursue her. [Thunder ] [ Pipes Playing ] Getoff!. Getoffthere! Ah, fie! Oh, sweetbeauty! Hownow, spirit? Whitherwanderyou? Overhill, overdale, through bush, through a briar, overpark, overpale, through flood,through a fire, I do wandereverywhere. Swifterthan the moon\\'s sphere. And I serve the fairyqueen, to dewherorbs upon the green. Either I mistake yourshape and making quite, orelse you are thatshrewd and knavish sprite called Robin Goodfellow. Are notyou he that frights the maidens ofthe villagery-- Psst! Skims milk, and sometimes labors in the quern and bootless makes the breathless housewife churn? Are notyou he? Thou speak\\'staright. I am thatmerrywanderer ofthe night. Ijestto Oberon and make him smile when I a fatand bean-fed horse beguile, neighing in likeness of a filly foal. And sometimes... Ugh! Farewell,thou lob ofspirits. I\\'ll be gone. The queen and all herelves come here anon. The king doth keep his revels here tonight. Take heed the queen come notwithin his sight. ForOberon is passing fell and wrath. [ Urinating ] - Hey! -Go on. Ill metbymoonlight, proud Titania. What,jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence. I have forsworn his bed and company. Tarry! Rashwanton, am not I thylord? Then I mustbe thylady. Why artthou here, come from the fartheststeppe ofIndia, butthat, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon, yourbuskin\\'d mistress and yourwarriorlove, to Theseus mustbe wedded, and you come to give theirbed joy and prosperity. How canstthouthus forshame,Titania, glance atmy credit with Hippolyta, knowing I know thylove to Theseus? These are the forgeries ofjealousy. And never, since the middle summer\\'s spring, metwe on hill, in dale, forest, ormead, by paved fountain orbyrushybrook, butwith thybrawls thou hastdisturbed oursport. Therefore,the winds, piping to us in vain, as in revenge, have sucked up from the sea contagious fogs, which, falling in the land, hath everypelting river made so proud thattheyhave overborne theircontinents. And this same progeny of evils comes from ourdebate, from ourdissension. We are theirparents and original. Do you amend itthen? Itlies in you. Whyshould Titania cross herOberon? I do butbeg a little changeling boy to be myhenchman. Setyourheartatrest. The fairyland buys notthe child ofme. His motherwas a votaress ofmy order, and in the spiced Indian air, bynight, full often hath she gossiped bymyside and satwith me on Neptune\\'syellowsands, marking the embarked traders on the flood when we have laughed to see the sails conceive and growbig-bellied with the wanton wind. Butshe, being mortal, ofthatboy did die, and forhersake do I rearup herboy. And forhersake I will notpartwith him. Howlong within thiswood intend you stay? Perchance till after Theseus\\'wedding day. Ifyouwill patiently dance in ourround... and see ourmoonlightrevels, go with us. Give me thatboy, and I will go with thee. Not forthy fairykingdom! Fairies, away! We shall chide downright ifI longerstay. Well, go thyway. Thou shaltnot from this grove till I tormentthee forthis injury. My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest, since once I sat upon a promontory and heard a mermaid on a dolphin\\'s back uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath thatthe rude sea grew civil athersong. Thatverytime, I saw, butthou couldstnot, flying between the cold moon and the Earth, Cupid all armed. Acertain aim he took and loosed his love shaftsmartly from his bow. Yet, marked I where the boltofCupid fell. It fell upon a little western flower, before milk-white, nowpurple with love\\'swound. Fetch me that flower. The juice ofit, on sleeping eyelids laid, will make all man, all woman madly dote upon the next live creature thatitsees. Fetch me this herb and be thou here again ere the leviathan can swim a league. I\\'ll puta girdle round aboutthe Earth in 40 minutes. Having once this juice, I\\'ll watch Titania when she\\'s asleep and drop the liquorofit in hereyes. The next thing then she waking looks upon... she shall pursue it with the soul oflove. And ere I take this charm from offhersight, I\\'ll make herrenderup herpage to me. I\\'ll make herrenderup herpage to me. Demetrius: I love thee not, therefore pursue me not! Where is Lysanderand fair Hermia? Thoutoldstme theywere stolen unto thiswood, and here am I, and wode within thiswood, because I cannotmeetmy Hermia! Hence! Getthee gone and followme no more! [ Honk Honk ] [ Honk Honk ] [Giggling ] Do I entice you? Do I speak you fair? Orrather, do I not in plainesttruth tell you I do not, nor I cannot, love you? And even forthat do I love youthe more. I am yourspaniel. And, Demetrius, the more you beatme, I will fawn on you. Use me butasyourspaniel. Spurn me, strike me, neglectme, lose me, but give me leave, unworthy as I am, to followyou. Whatworserplace can I beg in yourlove than to be used asyou use yourdog? Temptnottoo much the hatred ofmyspirit, for I am sick when I do look on thee. And I am sick when I look noton you! Do... impeachyourmodesty too much to leave the city and commityourself into the hands of one thatlovesyou not? To trustthe opportunity ofnight... and the ill counsel of a desertplace with the richworth ofyourvirginity? Yourvirtue is my privilege. Forthat itis notnight when I do see yourface. Therefore I think I am notin the night. Nordoth thiswood lack worlds of company, foryou in myrespect are all the world. I\\'ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes and leave thee to the mercy ofwild beasts! The wildesthath not such a heartasyou. Run when youwill, the storyshall be changed. Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase. The dove pursues the griffin. I will notstaythy questions! Letme go! Orifthou followme, do notbelieve but I shall do thee mischiefin the wood! Aye, in the temple, in the town, in the field, you do me mischief--oh! Fie, Demetrius! Yourwrongs do set a scandal on mysex! Oh! We cannot fight forlove as men may do. We should be wooed and were notmade to woo. I\\'ll followthee and make a heaven ofhell to die upon the hand I love so well. Fare thee well, nymph. Ere he shall leave this grove, thou shalt flyhim, and he shall seek thylove. Hastthouthe flowerthere? Ahh... I know a bank where the wild thyme blows, where oxlips and the nodding violet grows, quite overcanopied with the lusciouswoodbine, with sweetmusk-roses and with eglantine. There sleeps Titania sometime ofthe night. Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight. And there the snake throws herenameled skin, weed wide enough to wrap a fairyin. With the juice ofthis I\\'ll streak hereyes and make herfull ofhateful fantasies. Take thou some ofit and seek through this grove. AsweetAthenian lady is in love with a disdainful youth. Anointhis eyes, butdo itwhen the next thing he espies maybe the lady. Thou shaltknowthe man bythe Athenian garments he hath on. And look... thou meetme ere the firstcock crow. Fearnot, mylord. Yourservantshall do so. Hello, my queen. Howsweet! Hello. Sing me now asleep. Then to thy offices and letme rest. [Music Begins ] Hence, away. Now all iswell. One aloofstands sentinel. Whatthou seest when thou dostawake, do it forthytrue love take. Love... and languish forhis sake. Be itounce orcatorbear, pard, orboar with bristled hair... In thy eye thatdoth appear when thouwakest, itis thy dear. Wake when some vile thing is near. Fairlove. You faintwhen wandering in the wood, and to speak troth, I forgotourway. Oh. We\\'ll restus, Hermia, ifyouthink it good and tarryforthe comfort ofthe day. Be itso, Lysander. Well, find you outa bed... for I upon this bank shall restmyhead. Lysander! One turfshall serve as pillow forus both. One heart, one bed. Two bosoms and one troth. Nay, good Lysander. Formysake, my dear, lie furtheroffyet. Do notlie so near. Oh,take the sense, sweet, ofmyinnocence. I mean... thatmyheartunto yours is knit so thatbutone heart we can make ofit. Two bosoms interchained with an oath so then two bosoms in a single troth. Then byyourside, no bedroom me deny. Forlying so, Hermia, I do notlie. Lysanderriddlesveryprettily. Mmm. Nay, gentle friend. Mmm! Forlove and courtesy, lie furtheroff. In human modesty... such separation as maywell be said becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid. So farbe distant. And good night, sweet friend. Thylove ne\\'eralter till thysweetlife end. Amen. Amen to that fairprayer, say I. And then end life when I end loyalty. Here is mybed. Sleep give thee all his rest. With halfthatwish, the wisher\\'s eyes be pressed. Through the foresthave I gone, butAthenian found I none on whose eyes I mightapprove this flower\\'s force in stirring love. [ Bird Calls ] Night... and silence. Butwho is here? Weeds of Athens he dothwear--oh! This is he, mymastersaid, despised the Athenian maid. [ Honk ] And there the maiden, sleeping sound on the dank and dirty ground. Prettysoul. She durstnotlie with this lack-love, this kill-courtesy. Churl, upon thy eyes I throw all the power this charm doth owe. When thouwakest, letlove forbid sleep his seaton thy eyelid. And so awake when I am gone, for I mustnow... to Oberon! [ Honks Horn ] I charge thee hence, and do nothauntme thus. Oh,wiltthou darkling leave me? Do notso. Stay on thy peril. I alone will go. [ Breathing Hard ] I am outofbreath in this fond chase. The more my prayer, the lesseris my grace. Happyis Hermia, wheresoe\\'ershe lies, forshe hath blessed and attractive eyes. How came hereyes so bright? Notwith salttears. Ifso, my eyes are oftener washed than hers. No. No, no. No. I am as...ugly... as a bear. Forbeasts thatmeetme run away forfear. Lysander? Dead orasleep? Lysander, ifyou live, good sir, awake. Oh. And run through fire I will forthysweetsake. Where is Demetrius? Oh, how fita word is thatvile name to perish on mysword. Do notsayso, Lysander. Saynotso. What? Though he love your Hermia? Lord,whatthough? Yet Hermia still lovesyou, then be content. Contentwith Hermia? No. I do repent the tedious minutes I with herhave spent. Not Hermia, but Helena I love. Who will notchange a raven fora dove? Wherefore was I to this keen mockeryborn? When atyourhands did I deserve such scorn? Is\\'tnotenough, is\\'tnotenough,young man, that I did never, no, nornevercan, deserve a sweetlook from Demetrius\\' eye butyou must flout myinsufficiency? Oh, but fare youwell. Perforce I mustconfess, I thoughtyou lord ofmore true gentleness. She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleeps thouthere, and nevermaystthou come Lysandernear. And, all my powers, addressyourlove and might to honor Helen and to be herknight! [Sighs ] Aye, me. Forpity, whata dream was here. Ohh. Lysander, look how I do quake... with fear. Lysander? Lysander? Lysander! [Men Singing ] Here\\'s a marvelous, convenientplace forourrehearsal. This green plot shall be ourstage, this hawthorn brake ourtiring house, and we will, uh, do itin action aswe will do it before the duke. PeterQuince. Whatsayestthou, bully Bottom? There are things in this Comedy ofPyramus and... Thisby. Thisbythatwill neverplease. First, Pyramus mustdraw a sword to kill himself which the ladies cannotabide. By ourlady, a parlous fear. I believe we must leave the killing out when all is done. Nota whit. I have a device to make all well. Write me a prologue, and letthe prologue seem to say we will do no harm with ourswords and that Pyramus is not killed indeed, and forthe more betterassurance tell them that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver. Thiswill putthem outoffear. Oh,well,we will have such a prologue, and itshall be written in, uh, 8 and 6. No, make it2 more. Letitbe written in 8 and 8. Butthere is 2 hard things: Thatis to bring the moonlightinto a chamber, for,you know, Pyramus and Thisbymeetbymoonlight. Doth the moon shine thatnightwe play ourplay? Acalendar.Acalendar! Calendar. Look in the almanac. Find outifthe moon shine. Find outmoon shine. Itdoth shine thatnight. Itdoth shine thatnight. Why,then mayyou leave a casement ofthe greatchamberwindow open where we play, and the moon mayshine in atthe casement. Two hard things. We musthave a wall in the greatchamber, for Pyramus and Thisby, says the story, did talk through the chink of a wall. You can neverbring in a wall. Whatsayyou, Bottom? Some man orothermustpresentwall. Uh, Sam. Sam. And lethim have some plaster orsome loam orsome roughcastabouthim to signifywall. And lethim hold his fingers thus, and through thatcranny shall Pyramus and... Starveling:Thisby. Thisbywhisper. You can neverbring in a wall. No, no, no. A-And ifthis maybe, then all iswell. Quince: Pyramus,you begin, and when you have spoken yourspeech, enterinto thatbrake. Thisby, stand forth. Now, left foot forward and then antique gesture. Uh, Pyramus, speak. Whathempen homespuns have we swaggering here so nearthe cradle ofthe fairyqueen? Line. Quince:Thisby. Thisby, the flowers of odious savors sweet-- Odorous. Odorous. Odorous savors sweet, so hath thybreath, my dearestThisby dear. Buthark! Avoice. Staythou buthere awhile, and by and by I will to thee appear. Astranger Pyramus than e\\'erplayed here. Psst. [Whispering ] Must I speak now? Aye, marry, mustyou, forhe goes back to see a noise thathe heard and is to come again. Mostradiant-- Quince: [ Falsetto ] Mostradiant... [ Higher ] Mostradiant-- Mostradiant... [ Falsetto ] Mostradiant Pyramus... [ Laughter ] Most-- Quince: Shh. Shh. Lily-white ofhue... IfI were fair,Thisby. IfI were onlythine. [ Falsetto ] I\\'ll meetthee, Pyramus, at Ninny\\'s tomb. That\\'s Ninus\\'tomb, man! Why,you mustnotspeak thatyet. Thatyou answerto Pyramus. You speak all yourpartatonce, cues and all. Enter, Pyramus! The cue is past. Itis \"nevertire.\" [To Himself] IfI were fair,Thisby. IfI were fair,Thisby. IfI were fair,Thisby, I were onlythine. Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Quince: Oh, monstrous. Oh, strange. Fly, masters. We are haunted. Oh. Ooh. Bottom,thou artchanged. Whatdo I see on thee? Whatdo you see? What,you see an ass-head ofyourown, do you? Bless thee, Bottom. Bless thee. Thou arttranslated. Aah. [Screaming ] Why do theyrun away? I see theirknavery. This is to make an ass ofme, to frightme, ifthey could, but I will notstir from this place, do whatthey can. And I will sing thattheyshall hear I am notafraid. *The woosel cock so black ofhue * * With orange-tawnybill * *The throstle with his note so true * *The wren with little quill * [Voice Breaks ] Whatangel wakes me from my flowerybed? *The finch,the sparrow and the lark * *The plain-song cuckoo gray * * Whose note so many a man doth mark * * And dares notanswernay * [ Brays ] I praythee, gentle mortal, sing again. Mine earis much enamored ofthynote. So is mine eye enthralled to thyshape, and thy fairvirtues force, perforce, doth move me, on the firstview, to say...to swear, I love thee. M-M-Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason forthat, and yet, to saythe truth, reason and love keep little companytogethernowadays. [ Laughter ] Nay, I can gleek, upon occasion. Thou artaswise as thou artbeautiful. Notso, neither. [ Rustling ] IfI have witenough to getoutofthiswood, I have enough to serve mine own turn. Outofthiswood do notdesire to go. Oh! Aah! Thou shaltremain here, whetherthouwiltorno. I\\'ll give thee fairies to attend on thee, and theyshall fetch thee jewels from the deep and sing while thou on pressed flowers dostsleep, and I will purge thymortal grossness so thatthou shalt like an airyspirit go. Peaseblossom! Cobweb. - Ready. -And I. Moth and Mustardseed. -And I. -And I. Where shall we go? Be kind and courteous to this gentleman. Hop in hiswalks and gambol in his eyes. Feed him with apricocks and dewberries, with purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries. Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies. I cryyourworship\\'s mercy heartily. I beseechyourworship\\'s name. Cobweb. I shall desire you ofmore acquaintance, good Cobweb. IfI cutmy finger, I shall make bold-- Yourname, I prayyou. Mustardseed. Oh, I knowyourpatience well. Yourkindred have made my eyes waterere now. I shall desire you ofmore acquaintance, Mustardseed. [Opera Plays ] Hail, mortal. All: Hail, mortal. Hail, mortal. All: Hail, hail, hail. I wonderifTitania be awaked, then whatitwas thatnext came in hereye which she mustdote on in extremity. Hownow, mad spirit? Whatnight-rule now aboutthis haunted grove? Mymistresswith a monster is in love. [Whispering ] This falls outbetter than I could devise. [ Laughing ] Buthastthouyetlatched the Athenian\\'s eyes with the love-juice, as I did bid thee do? I took him sleeping. Thatis finished,too. Demetrius: ...so bitter... Stand close. Now I butchide. But I should use thee worse, forthou, I fear, has given me cause to curse. Ifthou hastslain Lysander in his sleep, being o\\'ershoes in blood, plunge in the deep, and kill me,too. This is the same Athenian. This is the woman... Uh-huh. Butnotthis the man. Hermia:The sun was not so true unto the day as he to me. Would he have stolen away from sleeping Hermia? Where is he? Good Demetrius, wiltthou give him me? I had rather give his carcass to myhounds. Ohh. Out, dog. Out, cur. Thou drivestme pastthe bounds ofmaiden\\'s patience. And hastthou killed him while sleeping? Oh, brave touch. Could nota worm, an adder, do so much? You spend yourpassion on a misprised mood. I am not guilty ofLysander\\'s blood, noris he dead, forall that I can tell. I praythee,tell me, then,thathe iswell. And ifI could, whatshould I gettherefore? Aprivilege neverto see me more. There\\'s no following her in this fierce vein. Here,therefore, fora while, I will remain. Whathastthou done? Thou hastmistaken quite and laid the love-juice on some true love\\'s sight. Aboutthe woods, go swifterthan the wind, and Helena of Athens look thou find. Bysome illusion look thou bring herhere. I\\'ll charm his eyes againsthe do appear. I go, I go! Look how I go! Swifterthan arrow from the tartar\\'s bow. The moon methinks lookswith herwateryeye, and when she weeps, weeps everylittle flower, lamenting some enforced chastity. [ Laughter ] [ Braying ] Come, lead him to mybower. Tie mylove\\'s tongue. Bring him silently. - [ Laughing ] - [ Braying ] [ Laughs ] [ Braying ] Flowerofthis purple dye, hitwith Cupid\\'s archery, sink in the apple ofhis eye. When his love he doth espy, lethershine as gloriously as the Venus ofthe sky. When thouwakestifshe be by, beg ofherforremedy. Captain of ourfairyband, Helena is here athand, and the youth, mistook byme, pleading fora lover\\'s fee. Shall we theirfond pageantsee? Lord,what fools these mortals be. Whyshould youthink that I should woo in scorn? Scorn and derision nevercome in tears. Look. When I vow, I weep, and vows so born, in theirnativity all truth appears. How can these things in me seem scorn to you, bearing the badge offaith to prove them true? You do advance yourcunning more and more. When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray. These vows are Hermia\\'s. Will you give hero\\'er? Weigh oathwith oath, and youwill nothing weigh. I had no judgment when to her I swore. Nornone, in mymind, nowyou give hero\\'er. Demetrius loves her, and he loves notyou. Helen... goddess... nymph... perfect... divine. To what, mylove, shall I compare thine eyne? Crystal is muddy. Oh, howripe in showthylips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow. Oh. Helen. Oh, spite. Oh, hell. I see you all are bent to setagainstme foryourmerriment. Can you nothate me, as I knowyou do, butyou must join in souls to mock me,too? Demetrius: Helen. Helen, it\\'s notso. Helen! [Grunting ] Oh, Lysander. Lysander? Love! Oh,whyunkindly didstthou leave me so? Whyshould he stay whom love doth press to go? Whatlove could press Lysanderfrom myside? Lysander\\'s love, thatwould notlethim bide. Whyseekestthou me? Could notthis make thee know the hate I bearthee made me leave thee so. You speak notasyouthink. Itcannotbe. Lo, she is one ofthis confederacy. Injurious Hermia. Mostungrateful maid. Have you conspired? Have you,with--with these, contrived to baitme with this foul derision? Is all the counsel thatwe two have shared, the sister\\'svows, the hours thatwe have spent when we have chid the hasty-footed time forparting us-- Oh, is all forgot? And will you rent ourancientlove asunder to join with men in scorning yourpoorfriend? Itis not friendly, \\'tis notmaidenly. Oursex, aswell as I, may chide you forit, though I alone do feel the injury. I understand not whatyou mean bythis. Aye, do. Persever, counterfeitsad looks, make mouths upon me when I turn myback. Ifyou have any pity, grace, ormanners, youwould notmake me such an argument, but fare youwell. \\'Tis partlymy own fault, which death orabsence soon shall remedy. Helena, I love thee. Bymylife, I do. Oh, excellent. I say I love thee more than he can do. Hermia: Lysander, do you not jest? Yes, sooth, and so do you. Ow! Am not I Hermia? I am as fairnow as I was erewhile. Whythen you leftme in earnest, shall I say? And neverdid desire to see thee more. Be certain, nothing truer, \\'tis no jestthat I hate thee and love Helena. Oh, me. You juggler! You cankerblossom! Youthief oflove. What, have you come bynight and stolen mylove\\'s heart from him? Oh, fine, in faith. Have you no modesty, no maiden shame, no touch ofbashfulness? What? Will youtear impatientanswers from my gentle tongue? Fie! Fie,you counterfeit, you puppetyou! Puppet? Whyso? Aye,thatway goes the game. Now I perceive thatshe hath made compare between ourstatures. She hath urged herheight, and with herpersonage, hertall personage, herheight, forsooth, she hath prevailed with him. And are you grown so... high in his esteem because I am so dwarfish and so low? Well, howlow am I, thou painted maypole? Speak. Howlow am I? I\\'m notyetso low butthatmynails can reach into thine eyes. -Aah! - Rrr! [Screaming ] Oh, I prayyou,though you mock me, gentlemen, do notletherhurtme. You perhaps maythink because she is somewhat lowerthan myself, that I can match her! Lower?! Hark again! Good Hermia, do notbe so bitterwith me. And now, so youwill letme quiet go, to Athenswill I bearmy follyback and followyou no further. Letme go.You see how simple and how fond I am. Why, getyou gone. Who is\\'tthathindersyou? Helena:Afoolish heart that I do leave here behind. What,with Lysander? With Demetrius! Be notafraid. She shall notharm thee, Helena! No, sir! She shall not, thoughyoutake herpart. She was a vixen when she wentto school, and though she be butlittle... Little? She is fierce. Little? Little again? Nothing butlow and little? Whywill you sufferher to floutme thus? Letme come to her! Getyou home,you dwarf, you minimus ofhindering knot-grass made, you bead,you acorn. Nowshe holds me not. Now followifthou darest, to trywhose right. Ofthine ormine, is mostin Helena. Follow? Nay, I\\'ll go with thee, cheek by jowl. You, mistress... all this coil is \\'long ofyou. Nay, go notback. Oh... I will nottrustyou, I, norlongerstay in yourcursed company. Yourhands than mine are quickerfora fray. Mylegs are longerthough, to run away! Ohh! Ohh! I am amazed and knownotwhatto say. Ohh! This is thynegligence. Still, still, still! Thou mistakest. Orelse... committ\\'stthyknaveries willfully, hmm? Believe me, king ofshadows, I mistook. Did notyoutell me I would knowthe man bythe Athenian garments thathe had on? Thou see\\'stthese lovers seek a place to fight. Hie therefore, Robin, overcastthe night, the starrywelkin coverthou anon with drooping fog as black as acheron, and lead these testyrivals so astray thatone come notwithin the other\\'sway,then... crush this herb into Lysander\\'s...

Up and down, up and down, I will lead them up and down. I am fear\\'d in field and town. Goblin, lead them up and down. Ah, ha ha ha ha! -Ah, here comes one. - [ Honks Horn ] Where artthou, proud Demetrius? Demetrius: Here,villain! Where artthou? I\\'ll be with thee straight. Lysander! Speak again! Thou runaway! Thou coward! Artthou fled? Come, recreant. Come,thou child. Yea! Artthouthere? Followmyvoice. We\\'ll tryno manhood here. Oh,the villain is much lighter-heeled than I. I follow\\'d fast, but fasterhe did fly. Then fallen am I in dark uneven way, and here will restme. O come,thou gentle day. Come hither! I am here! [ Honk Honk ] Nay,then.Thou mock\\'stme? Thou shaltbuythis dear if ever I thy face by daylightsee! Now go thyway. Faintness constraineth me to measure outmylength on this cold bed. By day\\'s approach... look to be visited. Neverso weary... neverso in woe. I can no furthercrawl, no further go. Here I will restme till the break ofday. Heavens shield Lysander, iftheymean a fray. Helena: O wearynight... O long and tedious night, abate thyhours, shine comforts from the east that I mayback to Athens by daylight, from these that my poorcompany detest. And sleep,thatsometimes shuts up sorrow\\'s eye, steal me awhile from mine own...company. Titania: Come, sitthee down upon this flowerybed, while I thy amiable cheeks do coy, and stick musk-roses in thysleek, smooth head, and kiss thy fairlarge ears, my gentle joy. Hmm. I mustto the barber\\'s. Methinks I\\'m marvelous hairy aboutthe face, and I am such a tenderass. Ifmyhairdo buttickle me, I mustscratch. What,wiltthou hearsome music, mysweetlove? Orsay, sweetlove, whatthou desirestto eat. Truly, a peck ofprovender. I could munch your good dryoats. Methinks I have a greatdesire to a bottle ofhay. Good hay, sweethay, hath no fellow. But, I prayyou, letnone ofyourpeople stirme. I have an exposition ofsleep come upon me. Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms. Fairies, begone, and be all ways away. So doth the woodbine, the sweethoneysuckle gently entwist... Mmm. The female ivyso enrings the barky fingers ofthe elm. Mmm... Oh, how I love thee! How I dote on thee! [Yawns Loudly ] Puck: On the ground, sleep sound. I\\'ll applyto... your eye... gentle lover... remedy. Heh heh heh. When thouwakest, thoutakesttrue delight in the sight of thyformer lady\\'s eye. Jack shall haveJill. Naughtshall go ill. The man shall have his mare again... and all shall be well. Welcome, good Robin. See\\'stthouthis sweetsight? Herdotage now I do begin to pity. I shall undo this hateful imperfection ofhereyes. Be as thouwastwontto be. See as thouwastwontto see. Now, myTitania... wake you, mysweetqueen. [Gasps ] Oh, my Oberon. Oh,whatvisions have I seen. Methought I was enamored of an ass. There liesyourlove. [Gasps ] How came these things to pass? Silence a while. Fairyking, attend and mark, I do hearthe morning lark. Then, my queen, in silence sad, trip we afternight\\'s shade. We the globe can compass soon, swifterthan the wandering moon. Come, mylord, and in ourflight, Tell me howitcame this night that I sleeping here was found with these mortals on the ground. We will, fairqueen, up to the mountain\\'s top, and mark the musical confusion ofhounds and echo in conjunction. Myhounds are bred out ofthe spartan kind, so flew\\'d, so sanded, and theirheads are hung-- With ears. [ Riders Shouting ] Butsoft. Whatnymphs are these? Mylord,this is my daughterhere asleep. And this, Lysander. This, Demetrius is. This, Helena. Old Nedar\\'s Helena. I wonderofthem being here together. No doubttheyrose up early to observe the rite ofMay. Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past. Begin these wood-birds butto couple now? I prayyou all, stand up. I knowyoutwo are rival enemies. How comes this gentle concord in the world, thathatred is so farfrom jealousy, to sleep byhate and fearno enmity? Mylord, I shall reply amazedly, halfsleep, halfwaking... Butas I think-- fortrulywould I speak-- I came with Hermia hither. Ourintentwas to be gone from Athens where we might withoutthe peril -ofthe Athenian law-- - Enough! Mylord, you have heard enough. I beg the law-- the law, upon his head. Theywould have stolen away. Theywould, Demetrius,thereby to have defeated you and me-- you ofyourwife, and me ofmy consent, ofmy consentthat she should be yourwife. My good lord, I wotnotbywhatpower, butbysome poweritis, mylove to Hermia melted as the snow, and all the faith, the virtue ofmyheart, the objectand the pleasure ofmine eye is only Helena. Fairlovers... you are fortunatelymet. Egeus, I will overbearyourwill, forin the temple by and bywith us these couples shall eternallybe knit. Awaywith us to Athens, three and three. We\\'ll hold a feast in greatsolemnity! Come, Hippolyta. When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer. Mynext is \"Most fair Pyramus...\" Heigh-ho. PeterQuince? Flute! Snoutthe tinker! Starveling! God\\'s mylife, stolen hence, and leftme asleep! I have had a mostrare vision. I have had a dream... pastthe witofman to say whatdream itwas-- Man is butan ass ifhe go about to expound this dream. Methought I was... There is no man can tell what. Methought I was... Methought I had... Butman is buta patched fool ifhe will offerto say whatmethought I had. The eye ofman hath notheard. The earofman hath notseen. Man\\'s hand is notable to taste, his tongue to conceive, norhis heartto report whatmy dream was. I will get PeterQuince to write a ballad ofthis dream. Itshall be called Bottom\\'s... Dream... because ithath no bottom. And I will sing it in the latterend of a play before the duke. Peradventure,to make it the more gracious, I shall sing itatherdeath. Have you sentto Bottom\\'s house? Has he come home yet? He cannotbe heard of. Outofdoubt, he is transported. Ifhe come not, then the playis marred. It goes not forward, doth it? Masters! The duke is coming from the temple, and there\\'s two orthree lords and ladies more married. If oursporthad gone forward, we had all been made men. O sweetbully Bottom! Thus hath he lostsixpence a day during his life. Had the duke had not given him sixpence forplaying Pyramus, I\\'ll be hanged. He would\\'ve deserved it. Sixpence a dayin Pyramus, ornothing. [CartApproaching ] Where are these lads? - Bottom! - Bottom! Where are these hearts? - Bottom! -O courageous day! - Bottom! - Bottom! O mosthappyhour! Masters, I am to discourse wonders, butask me notwhat. Letus hear, sweet Bottom. Nota word ofme. All I will tell you is thatthe duke hath dined. Getyourapparel together. Everyman, look o\\'erhis part. LetThisbyhave clean linen, and letnothim thatplays the lion pare his nails, fortheyshall hang out forthe lion\\'s claws! [Operatic Tenor Singing In Italian ] Rrahhrr! If itplease you. These things seem small and indistinguishable, like far-offmountains turning into clouds. And I have found my Demetrius like a jewel mine own, and notmine own. Oh. \\'Tis strange, myTheseus, thatthese lovers speak of. More strange than true. I nevermaybelieve these antique fables, northese fairytoys. Lovers and madmen have such seething brains, such shaping fantasies thatapprehend more than coolerreason evercomprehends. Such tricks hath strong imagination, thatifitwould butapprehend some joy, itcomprehends some bringerofthe joy. Butall the story ofthe nighttold over, and all theirminds transfigured so together, more witnesseth than fancyimages and grows to something of greatconstancy, but, howsoever, strange and admirable. [Tapping Glass ] Joy, gentle friends. Joy and fresh days oflove accompanyyourhearts. More than to uswait in yourroyal walks, yourboard,yourbed. [ Bangs Down Fork ] [Quartet Resumes Playing ] Come now,whatmasques, whatdances shall we have to wearawaythis long age of3 hours between ourafter-supper and bedtime? Where is ourusual managerofmirth? Here, mightyTheseus. Whatrevels are in hand? Is there no play to ease the anguish of a torturing hour? There is a briefhow manysports are ripe. \"Battle with thecentaurs, to be sung by an Athenian eunuch to the harp.\" We\\'ll none ofthat. \"The riot ofthetipsybacchanals, tearing the Thraciansinger intheirrage.\" Thatis an old device, and itwas played when I from Thebes came lasta conqueror. \"Thethricethree muses mourning for thedeathoflearning, latedeceased in beggary.\" Thatis some satire, keen and critical, notsorting with a nuptial ceremony. \"Atedious briefscene ofyoung Pyramus and his love Thisby. Verytragical mirth.\" Merry and tragical? Tedious and brief? Thatis hotice and wondrous strange snow. Whatare theythatdo playit? Hard-handed men thatwork in Athens here, which neverlabored in theirmind till now, and nowhave toiled theirunbreathed memories with this same play againstyournuptial. We will hearit. No, no, mylord. I did hearitover, and itis nothing, nothing in the world. I will hearthatplay. The, um, short and the long is... ourplayis preferred. Forneveranything can be amiss when simpleness and dutytenderit. [ Praying ] [ Procession Plays ] Moonshine shall shine in atthe casement. So please,your grace, the prologue is addressed. Lethim approach. Courage, man, courage. In this same interlude itdoth befall that I, one Snoutbyname, presenta wall. And such a wall as I would have youthink thathad in it a crannied hole... orchink... throughwhich the lovers-- throughwhich the lovers-- Pyramus and Thisby. [ Louder ] Pyramus and Thisby. Pyramus and Thisby! Pyramus and Thisby did whisperoften verysecretly. And this the crannyis, rightand sinister, throughwhich the fearful lovers are to-- Whisper. [Audience Laughs ] Would you desire lime and hair to speak better? Itis the wittiestpartition as ever I heard discourse, mylord. Pyramus draws nearthe wall. Silence. O grim-looked night! O nightwith hue so black! O night, which everartwhen dayis not. O night! O night! Alack, alack, alack! I fearmyThisby\\'s promise is forgot. And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovelywall, thatstands between herfather\\'s ground and mine. Thouwall, O wall, O sweetand lovelywall, showme thy chink to blink throughwith mine eyne. Thanks, courteouswall. Jove, shield thee well forthis. Butwhatsee I? No Thisby do I see. Oh,wicked wall throughwhom I see no bliss, curse be thystones forthus deceiving me. The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again. No, in truth, sire, he should not. \"Deceiving me\" is Thisby\\'s cue. He--She is to enternow, and I am to spyher through the wall. You shall see itwill fall pat, as I told you. Yondershe comes. [ Falsetto Voice ] Oh,wall, full often hastthou heard mymoans for-- [Audience Laughing ] Forparting-- Forparting my fair Pyramus and me. My ch-cherrylips have often kissed thystones-- thystoneswith lime and hairknitup in thee. I see a voice. Nowwill I to the chink to spy and I can hearmyThisby\\'s face. Thisby... mylove? Thou artmylove, I think. Think whatthouwilt, I am thylover\\'s grace. And like Limander, am I trustystill. And I, like Helen, till the fates me kill. Oh, kiss me through the hole ofthisvile wall. I kiss the wall\\'s hole, notyourlips atall. Wiltthou at Ninny\\'s tomb-- That\\'s Ninus\\'tomb. That\\'s Ninus\\'tomb-- Meetme straightway? \\'Tide life, \\'tide death, I come withoutdelay. Thus have I,wall, my partdischarged so. And being done, thuswall away doth go. Here come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion. You ladies,you, whose gentle hearts do fear the smallestmonstrous mouse thatcreeps on floor, maynowperchance both quake and tremble here when lion rough in wildestrage doth roar. Rrrroowwrr! Forknowthat I, as Snug the joiner, am a lion-fell norelse no lion\\'s dam. ForifI should as lion come in strife into this place, \\'twere pity on mylife. Rowr! Rowr! [ LouderApplause ] Moonshine. Moonshine. Letme playthe moon. I-- This lantern doth the horned moon present-- [ Laughter ] This lantern doth the horned moon present myselfthe man in the moon do seem to be-- [ Laughter ] All I have to sayis to tell you thatthis lantern is the moon, I\\'m the man in the moon, this thornbush, mythornbush-- [ Barks ] And this dog...my dog. Oh. Oh, silence. Here comes Thisby. Where is mylove? - [ Roars ] - [Screams ] [ Barking ] Well roared, lion. Well run,Thisby. Well shone, moon. And then came Pyramus. Sweetmoon, I thank thee forthysunnybeams. I thank thee, moon, forshining nowso bright. Forbythy gracious, golden, glittering gleams I trustto take oftruestThisbysight. Butstay...O spite. Butmark, O light, whatdreadful dole is here? Eyes, do you see? How can itbe? O dainty duck... O dear,thymantle good. What, stained with blood? Approach,ye furies fell.

No. Mysoul is in the sky. Tongue, lose thylight, moon,take thy flight. Now die... die... die... die... die. [Applause ] Asleep, mylove? [ Laughter ] What, dead, my dove? Oh! Oh! Oh! [ Normal Voice ] O Pyramus...arise. Speak, speak. Quite dumb? Dead, dead? Atomb mustcover thysweeteyes. These lilylips, this cherrynose, these yellow cowslip cheeks are gone, are gone.

No, I assure you, the wall is down thatparted theirfathers. Will itplease you to see the epilogue, orheara Bergonmask dance between two of ourcompany? No epilogue, I prayyou, foryourplayneeds no excuse. Neverexcuse forwhen the players are all dead, there need none to be blamed.

      " 'Sir, shoals on every side. Sand or reef, I cannot say. Captain, the Malay pirates have us cornered. We must surrender. Surrendering my father\\'s ship will not guarantee survival, Mr Phelps. Shallow water. Dead ahead, full sails! Captain! The ship will run aground. It\\'s impossible! You know my views on that word, Mr Phelps. Full sails. Full sails! Full sails, boys. Full sails! Hard to port, Harper! Turning to port at full sail will tip us over. Exactly! Lads, get those sails down! We haven\\'t got all day! Hold on, everyone! It\\'s too shallow. We need full sails! Will! Hold on, lad! Help! She\\'s going over. Hold on, boys! Hold on, lads! You did it, Captain! The only way to achieve the impossible is to believe it is possible. Set a course for London, Harper. Our work here is done. Splice the mainbrace, lads! We\\'re going home! Captain ashore. Captain. - Mother. - Well... Here you are. Finally. Miss Kingsleigh? You and the Wonder have been expected for over a year. There were complications. Pirates and such. The ledgers are in my cabin. And would you please let Lord Ascot know I should like to see him immediately. I\\'m afraid Lord Ascot passed away whilst you were at sea. The title\\'s been passed on to his son. - Hamish? - Indeed. Now chairman of the board. How unfortunate. Your letters were so infrequent. I hardly know where you\\'ve been all this time. Mother, China\\'s incredible. We followed the Yangtze deep into the interior. Most of the people had never seen a person with yellow hair before. - Were you never afraid? - Of course. But, when I was, I thought of Father. You sound just like him. I miss him. I do, too. But the years pass quickly for me now. Time is a cruel master. Time is a thief. And a villain. I hear the Ascots are marking Hamish\\'s succession tonight. Perfect. We should go. I\\'m afraid the invitation must have been lost in the post. Nonsense. Lady Ascot once said we would always be welcome. Besides, I have a proposition for Hamish. Hamish married last year, Alice. He seems to have got over your public rejection. A business proposition, Mother. You\\'re leaving again? So soon? There are matters here which might benefit from your attention. After my next voyage... you won\\'t have to worry about anything. Am I permitted to worry about tonight? I do wish you\\'d worn that yellow dress. If it\\'s good enough for the Dowager Empress of China... then it\\'s good enough for the Ascots. Must you always be so headstrong? No. It\\'s just more fun that way. What is she wearing? It\\'s the Kingsleigh girl. Excuse me. Outrageous. Circus performer. Miss Kingsleigh? What are you doing here? I\\'ve come to give my report to Lord Ascot. Right. Well, follow me. Helen. What a surprise. Alice. Well. Welcome home. We were afraid you might never come back with our ship. My ship. Hello, Hamish. It\\'s proper to refer to my husband as Lord Ascot. That is why we\\'re having this little soirée after all. Miss Kingsleigh, this is my wife, Alexandra. The new Lady Ascot. Hamish tells me you\\'ve travelled the world these last three years. Yes. I\\'ve just returned. Well, then how was it? The world? Yes. Highly enjoyable. You should visit it sometime. Apologies for the intrusion, Lord Ascot... but I\\'ve come to give my report. Of course. Follow me, Miss Kingsleigh. And you, Mr Harcourt. Gentlemen, might I introduce Miss Alice Kingsleigh. Miss Kingsleigh, the board. Good evening, gentlemen. The world has opened to us, but we must move quickly. It is my belief that further expeditions along the Wu River... I\\'m sorry, Miss Kingsleigh. There will be no further expeditions. What? Now, there is a position in our clerking office. You will start in files... but in time... This isn\\'t about China, is it? It\\'s because I turned you down when you asked me to marry you. I am sorry, Miss Kingsleigh, but this is all that we can do for you. No other company is in the business of hiring female clerks. Let alone ship\\'s captains. You can\\'t do this. I own 10% of the company. Your father set those shares aside for me. Oh, correction. He gave them to your mother... who sold them to me a year ago, while you were gone. Along with the bond on the house. Her house? The bond we will redeem against your ship. But that was my father\\'s ship. Indeed. Sign over the vessel... and you will redeem the house. Report to work Monday morning... and you will receive a salary and a pension. And give up the Wonder? Otherwise, we cannot help you. Or your mother. Alice. Alice. Alice! How could you sell our shares? Everything I do is for you, Alice. So you can make a decent start in life. Five minutes ago I was a sea captain. A sea captain is no job for a lady. Time is against you, and you\\'re being careless with it. I once believed I could do as many as six impossible things before breakfast. That is a child\\'s dream, Alice. The Wonder is just a ship. It\\'s not just a ship. It\\'s Father\\'s ship. Everything he loved. Everything I love. He never would have let this happen. Well, he\\'s not here any more! You can\\'t just make things however you want them to be. Every woman must face that, Alice. I\\'ve had to. Well, the last thing I want is to end up like you. Sign over the Wonder? And give up on the impossible? Then who will I be? You\\'re Alice, of course. Absolem? Absolem. She had spent months up river. Dressed like she\\'d gone native. Of course, it\\'s known to do strange things to a man\\'s mind, let alone a woman\\'s. - Wait! - Just like her father. A great man, no doubt, but one touched in the head. It appears the apple has not fallen far from the tree. Absolem. Curious. It\\'s locked! Someone\\'s in there. - Who\\'s in there? - Who\\'s in there? You\\'re trespassing! This room is out of bounds! Someone get the key! Lord Ascot, there\\'s someone in your father\\'s study. Curiouser and curiouser. Ooh. Oh, no, not again! All my horses. All my men. To the rescue. All the pieces together first, chaps. In a pile, over here. How do I look? Tell me. I can take it. He\\'s not all he\\'s cracked up to be. He\\'s a mere shell of a man. Oh, please. You always make that joke. Don\\'t you mean \"yolk\"? Get some new material. I would be most grateful... Sorry. Clumsy as always, and twice as dim. I thought you\\'d never get the idea. Oh, Absolem. Excuse me, young lady. We\\'ll be needing that. Oh, you all disgust me. You\\'ve been gone too long, Alice. And he will be gone before long. Who will be gone? What has happened? All will become clear in the fullness of Time. For now, hurry. Oh... And do mind your step. Hey! - Alice. - Oh, Alice. Thank goodness you\\'re finally here. It\\'s that girl again. Alice. You\\'re back. Don\\'t be nice to her. She\\'s late. Have I come at a bad time? On the contrary. We were afraid you weren\\'t coming at all. What\\'s the matter? The Hatter\\'s the matter. Or the matter of the Hatter. - The former. - No, the latter. - Mmm... - Tweedles? He\\'s mad. The Hatter? - Mmm. - Mmm. Yes, I know. That\\'s his muchness. That\\'s what makes him so... him. But he\\'s grown darker... less dafter. Denies himself laughter. And no scheme of ours can raise any sort of smile. We rather hoped you might help us save him. What happened? There was a great storm. We ventured out into the Tulgey Woods to investigate. Come, quadruped. Fetch! Your turn! Fetch, doggy. Hatter was perfectly hatterish. Until... that blue paper hat... somehow put him in mind... ...of his family\\'s tragedy. Slain by the Jabberwocky, on Horunvendush Day... many years ago. He\\'s just not himself any more. But, if anything could bring the Hatter back, it would be seeing you again. - Oh, yes. - Indeed. Well, where is he? Uh... Go away! You can\\'t come in. Hatter, it\\'s me. Alice. Alice. You\\'re you. And you\\'re here. You are you, aren\\'t you? Yes, Hatter. Good. You\\'re the only one. But you\\'ve always been Alice. And that\\'s how I know you\\'ll believe me. I\\'ve missed you, Hatter. It\\'s my family, Alice. Your family? Yes. My family. Lost for many years. Or so I thought. Look. I found this. The first hat I ever made. I thought I\\'d tossed it away long, long ago. It\\'s impossible for it to be here, and yet... here it is. So if this hat survived... my family must have too. But, Hatter, that\\'s... I thought I wasn\\'t worthy of the Hightopp name. Very serious man, my father. We had a terrible fight. I never said I was sorry when I had the chance. But this means... that I can make things right. Hatter... your family, uh... You... do believe me, don\\'t you, Alice? I want to. I... Hatter! You\\'re not well. What can I do? Of course. My Alice... could bring my family back to me. Oh, but... Hatter, the thing is... your family died. Long ago. You told me so yourself. No one can bring them back. No one but you. I\\'m sorry. But it\\'s... It\\'s impossible. You... are not you. Hatter, please. Get out. I don\\'t know who you are. You\\'re not my Alice. My Alice would believe me. Hatter! Hatter, please! Please! We must do something. He\\'s so terribly ill. I fear he\\'s... dying. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. No... We can\\'t lose him, Alice. We can\\'t. He said, to make him better, I must bring his family back. But that... cannot be. Unless it could. - What? - Oh. Unless there was a way. No, no, no. You mustn\\'t. You mustn\\'t. What is it? It is dangerous. Perilous. It is too much to ask! What is it? Alice. You must travel back in time. Oh, no. Go back into the past and save the Hatter\\'s family. If the Hatter\\'s delusion is made true... ...then he would be made well again. - Go back in time? - Hmm. But how? The Chronosphere. I\\'m sorry, the Chrono-what? The Chronosphere. The source that powers the Grand Clock of All Time. Legend has, it also lets one travel across the Ocean of time. None of us can use it because we\\'ve already been in the past. And if your past self sees your future self... What happens? There is no history of it happening. But it is said that if it were to happen... everything would be history. That sounds very dangerous. It is. Extremely so. Because you\\'re not from here, only you can use it, Alice. It\\'s not impossible... merely... un-possible. Got ya! Hatter is my truest friend. If he\\'s in need, I will help him. No matter what. Oh, Alice! - So brave. - I knew she\\'d help us. Where exactly is this Chronosphere? In the hands of Time. It\\'s his. I\\'m sorry. Time is a he? He lives in a void of infinitude, in a castle of eternity. Through here, one mile past the pendulum. Very cold. Find Time\\'s castle, borrow the Chronosphere... travel back in time to Horunvendush Day... save the Hatter\\'s family from being killed, and thereby save the Hatter. And do try not to break the past, present, or future. Shh! I was only trying to help. What could go wrong? Fairfarren, Alice. Hatter\\'s counting on you. We all are. Hello? Anybody here? Hello? Whoa... Stupid me-shaped corridor. Will this day never end? It clings to me like a pair of sweaty pantaloons. Who has stopped? Who has ticked... their last tock? Tocked... their last tick? Ah. Brilliam... Hinkle. Brilliam Hinkle. Your time is up. Hmm. Let\\'s put you away, Mr Hinkle... ...in the right place, like alphabetical order. Ah, Higgens. Highbottom. Not here yet. Highturn. Highview, Himmelby. Ah, Hinkle. I hope you were happy. I hope you used your time well. Good night. Hmm? Who is there? I saw you. How did you get in? It is impossible. Come out, you little, wriggling worm! Oh. - It\\'s a girl. - Please, sir. I\\'m sorry to disturb you... but if I could just have a moment of your time. Time? Young lady... I am... Time. The infinite... the eternal... the immortal... the immeasurable. Unless you have a clock. So, being Time... I must give some of myself... for you to have me. Are you following what I\\'m saying? Yes. Really? Oh. Do you promise to be concise? Well, I can most... Because if there\\'s one thing I do not like, it is... people who are unable, unwilling, or, um... Un... Un... Uh... uncompelled to form short sentences. My friend is in mortal danger. Enough of your incessant jabbering! I have important work to do. Please! You haven\\'t answered my question. One minute. Why do you carry that fallen soldier in your pocket? Reveal him now. He is broken. Kaput. It was my father\\'s. I would never part with it. Everyone parts with everything eventually, my dear. Behold. The magnificent Grand Clock of All Time. He is me, and I am he... and all that was or ever shall be. I thought up that poem. Now, remember. Look lively, everyone. Ah, Wilkins! Shoulders back, eyes forward. How is, uh, my invincible machine, hmm? - Well, it\\'s... Oh. - Silence! You will speak when you are spoken to. - He was spoken to. - Nonsense! The machine, Wilkins. How is it? Um... Hello. And who might you be? These miniscule artisans are my Seconds. Curious! And I suppose every Second counts. Count? I wish. They are rather stupid. That was rude of me. I\\'m sorry. I told you. Imbeciles. Come on. So, your question. What is it? You have exactly one minute. It\\'s about the Hatter... Tarrant Hightopp. He\\'s a great friend of mine. And recently he\\'s convinced that his long-deceased family is still alive. And, of course, his family cannot really be alive... because you see, the Jabberwocky killed his family on the Horunvendush Day... and I killed the Jabberwocky on the Frabjous Day... and I\\'d like your permission to borrow the Chronosphere. - It is imperative that... - Ah. The Chronosphere. That wasn\\'t a minute. You want to borrow it. Loan it. Purloin it. Yes. You ask... to disintegrate history. The Chronosphere powers the Grand Clock. But I need it. Without it, the Hatter may never get better. - And I have to... - Wilkins! Wilkins! Stupid door. Did you call, sir? Wilkins, please remove this, uh... yellow-haired kindergartener, here. Immediately, sir! No interlopers! Thank you for your you, sir. Come along, come along. My what? For your Time. Young lady... you cannot change the past. Though I dare say, you might learn something from it. Come on, you! This next generation. Now, back the way you came, miss. All the way to the end. Auf Wiedersehen. - Oh. Uh... - Wilkins! Yes, sir! She\\'s here! My liebchen is here! Coming, sir! Hurry! Quick! All right. Here we go. Ding, ding! Seconds out! Seconds out! Oh. Ah! Get back. Stay in line. Stay in line! Your Highness. Your Majesty! Majesty! My lord is expecting you in the parlour. Shall I announce you? Oh, no mind! I\\'ll announce myself. Tick Tock! Where are you? Tick Tock! Where are you? Tick Tock! Coming, my love! Present! Of course. My darling... may I say that your head is looking very, very big today. Hmm. Oh. I present you with a gift made entirely out of love. And also a little bit of metal and wood, of course. I know how you love the tiny things. Hmm? Oh. Hmm. Ooh! Ahh! I\\'ll treasure it forever. Oh. Good! Hmm? Oh, dear. The Chronosphere. What troubles you, my dear? You know what it is that I desire. But, my love, I have done so much for you already. Yes, yes, that\\'s all very well. But don\\'t you see? That... with my big brain... and your... little Chronosphere... I could get even with my sister. And we could rule the past, the present, and the future. You ask the impossible, my dear. I cannot give you the Chronosphere. You would if you loved me. No one loves me. No one fears me. But I do love you. Hmm? Kiss? Oh, no. Oh... The Grand Clock! Wilkins! Right behind you, sir! - Tick Tock! - Hmm? Seconds into Minutes. Tick Tock! Don\\'t abandon me when I\\'m sulking! What\\'s the matter with you? The Chronosphere. Alice. No! Stop her! Stop her, you imbeciles! Which idiot labelled that? You did, my lord. Thank you for admitting your mistake. Idiot! How do I work this? Halt! Stop! Stop, you little mouse! No. No! How do I look? Tell me. I can take it. He\\'s a mere shell of a man. It\\'s like a ship. Dead ahead. Come, quadruped. Fetch! Hatter! Don\\'t worry, Hatter. I\\'ll save you and your family. Alice? The Alice? Slayer of my Jabberbabywocky? Oh. The very reason why I have been banished from my kingdom? That Alice? Idiot! I want her head! Are you all right, sir? It has begun. Without the Chronosphere... the Grand Clock will break down. Time myself will stop... and all in Underland will perish. Did you say perish? Wilkins, you must keep the Grand Clock ticking. Me? I said that out loud, didn\\'t I? I mean, of course, sir. And I must find the kindergartner. Oh, my goodness! What\\'s happening? She must have the Chronosphere. Take care, dear Alice. All our hopes fly with you. Horunvendush Day! Aha! You! Give me what is mine! Give it back... or there will be none of me left. Come back! You cannot win in a race against Time. I am inevitable! Hatter? Hatter? Oh! It\\'s you! You\\'re you again! Well, if I\\'m not, I wish I was. - Have we met? - Yes! Well, no. I mean, not yet. It\\'s funny... I feel like I should know you. Well, we have met once, when I was younger. I\\'m afraid I don\\'t recall. That\\'s because it hasn\\'t happened yet. - Oh, when will it happen? - Years from now. When you\\'re older. I\\'ll meet you when you\\'re younger and I\\'m older? I realise it doesn\\'t make much sense. Makes perfect sense to me. I\\'m Tarrant. I know. I\\'m Alice. Alice, you seem to have time all mixed up. Oh, he\\'s not mixed up at all. Actually he\\'s quite angry with me. You\\'re bonkers, aren\\'t you? Huh. That\\'s what I\\'ve been told. All the best ones are. Listen, I know it sounds strange, but I need to find your family. Oh, well, you\\'re in luck. Right this way. Wonderful! - Indeed. - Hmm. Congratulations, dear Mirana, on your coming of age. And now... the heir. The crown for the Princess Iracebeth. Ignorant peasants. Hmm. Quiet! What are you doing, you idiot? Put it on my head! You\\'re making me look stupid. Get on with it! You incompetent imbecile! Silence! The next person who laughs will never laugh again! Oh. Iracebeth, please! However would you stop people from laughing? Uh, put a bag on her head. Put a bag on your head! Put a bag on all of your heads! Yes! We\\'ll sew up your lips... carve your tongues, cut off your ears, off with you! Just off, off, off with their... Off with their... Iracebeth, enough! Iracebeth... I had always hoped... that you would one day show the necessary qualities to become the queen... you were born to be. I realise now that day will never come. People of Witzend... upon my death... my crown will pass... to the Princess Mirana. Huh? Father, no. But that\\'s not fair! I\\'m the eldest! You are unfit to rule, Iracebeth. I hate you. I hate you all! Oh! And I shall not ever forget you, you sniggering Hightopps! No, I shall wreak a terrible revenge! Vile. - Slow. - Racie. Oh, don\\'t \"Racie\" me! You started it. Why don\\'t you tell them the truth? I didn\\'t think so. No one loves me. No one loves me! - Racie. - Iracebeth! If you are to be a hatter worthy of the Hightopp name... you must be sane, sober, disciplined. Everything you now are not! Oh. All I did was laugh, Father. Couldn\\'t help it. Her head is rather voluminous. You cost the princess her crown! Do you know what this means to us? Why am I never good enough for you? Why are you always such a disappointment to me? There. You\\'ve said it. You\\'ve said it, Father. Well, if I\\'m such a disappointment... I don\\'t suppose you\\'ll be sorry if I leave home. No. Tarrant! My hat please, Mom. Tarrant. - Zanik. - No. Please. Tell him to stay. Zanik, please. Tarrant. Tarrant? Hatter! Hatter. Wait. I am no hatter. Of course you are. You\\'re the Hatter. Or you will be at least when I knew you. You should meet my friend Thackery. He\\'s nearly as mad as you. Won\\'t you join us for some tea? Hatter, please. You must go back to your family. What do you know of my family? They\\'re in danger. You have to warn them about Horunvendush Day. No idea what you\\'re talking about. But if my father sent you to change my mind, you won\\'t! If you don\\'t go now and reconcile, you\\'ll be sorry. I know you will. Maybe later. I lost my father. And I miss him every day. If you walk away now, you will lose your father, too. It\\'s forever for me. But it doesn\\'t have to be forever for you. You can still get him back, and then you\\'ll really be you again. And a hatter just like him. The last thing I want is to end up like my father. Tarrant, wait! Your family will be lost and you will have done nothing to stop it! Fine. I\\'ll warn them myself. Mr Hightopp. If I could just have a moment of your time... there\\'s something terribly important you should know about. Mr Hightopp. Our apologies. You know of my sister\\'s misfortune. Uh, no apologies necessary, Your Highness. All of Witzend laments the day of your sister\\'s accident. Fell Day, as the clock struck 6. I shall never forget that snowy night when she hit her head in the town square. She and I had... That moment changed everything. But if that moment never happened... there\\'d be no Horunvendush Day. Hatter would be saved! Excuse me. Who was that strange girl? Oh, dear. Don\\'t worry, men. We can do this! Just not with him. Cheer up, Tarrant. We\\'ll have fun now that you\\'re living here. It\\'s tea time! Twinkle, twinkle little bat How I wonder where you\\'re at Up above the... - Ugh. - Oh. Ow. Hmm? Ah... Who\\'s he? Greetings, Underlings. I am Time. The infinite and immortal. The personification of time itself. I know you may find this concept a little bit hard to digest... but please keep your bewilderment brief and to the point. Your Majesty. Nice to meet you, sir. Hmm. I seek a thief of meagre intellect. Her hair... Yes? Yellowish. Her name... Alice. And what is your business with her? She took something from me. I will not say what it was. It\\'s not important. It is a trifle. I don\\'t see why you are making such a fuss. It is as nothing. I must have it back. But not that I\\'m concerned. - Uh, uh, uh... - As soon as possible. Either way, I\\'m fine with the outcome. Hmm? Give it to me. Who knows about it? Hmm. Hmm. Hmm? Well, you are in luck, oh, timely one. Because just today... I invited Alice to tea. - Wait. What\\'s an Alice? - Shush! Why don\\'t you have a seat... and we can wait together. There\\'s no room at the table. - Shh. - No room. No room. Plenty of room. Plenty of room. - Tea for our guest. - Ha! Tea time! We\\'re having such a lovely Time here. Oh. Would ya like a scone? Scone. - No. - So... if you are really Time itself, yourself, or whatever suchness you claim... Scone. Scone. ...perhaps you can answer me this. I have always wondered when \"soon\" is. If you vex me, it will be an eternity. No! It\\'s not fair! It\\'s not fair! He Really reminds me of someone. I can\\'t think who. I think he looks a little bit like you, Brother. Nonsense! He\\'s hideous. He looks more like you. Come back! Hey, Tarrant. Tarrant. Watch this. Now you see me. Now you... Wait a moment. Wait a moment. Don\\'t! Where\\'d the cat go? - Ow. - Gotcha! Hmm. Have at you. Contrariwise, have at you. Huh? It\\'s nearly 6. Hello. You have a very nice head. Thank you. And a nice head deserves a very nice hat. That\\'s what my father says. He makes the best hats in Witzend. Would you like him to make you one? Come on. He can make any hat. A bonnet or boater, dunce hat, fez, a cloche, coif, snood, barboosh, or pugree. You\\'re eating all the tarts. - You can have the crusts. - I don\\'t want the crusts. If you can\\'t get along... there\\'ll be no more tarts for either of you. Now, out of my kitchen. Scat! Is it true that you heal all wounds? Time is on my side. And why is it you wait for no man? I just can\\'t find the Time. Chessur. Where have you been? You\\'re late. Actually, I\\'m right on Time. I\\'ve got Time on my hand. Do you silly nitwits... really think that I have not heard these cheap barbs before? Your attempts at mockery fall flat. Look. Time is flying. Enough! No more wasting me. I\\'m having the time of my life? Father, look. A customer with a lovely head... - right here. - Mmm... What is the hat of your heart\\'s desire, madam? Something... feathery? Something... button-y? Good afternoon, miss. Good afternoon, sir. The function of a hat is to follow the proper dictum of society. Hmm? Not to be fun. Father... I have something fun. What is it? It\\'s a hat. Oh, Tarrant, you\\'ve got it on backwards. - Stop. You\\'ll ruin it. - Now, let me finish. Oh. Oh, dear. Oh, well. Tomorrow... I\\'ll show you precisely how to make a proper hat. Hmm? Tarrant? You\\'re too hard on him, Zanik. Hatting is a serious business. I can\\'t have his frivolous ideas keep him from his true potential. Now. Yes. Yes, I think this hat will suit you... perfectly. Thank you ever so much, Mr Hightopp. Although, I really must be on my way. Have a lovely evening. Where is she? What are you doing? Nothing. When is she coming? Uh... Well... I never actually said she was coming... old bean. I merely said I had invited her. Very good. Very clever. Well played, sir. Well played. Thank you. You were asking me before when \"soon\" is? Let me try to explain when is now, all right? Now is... exactly 1 minute till tea time. And until the young Alice joins you for tea... it will always remain 1 minute till tea time... for you and your... dunderheads. - Hmm? - Watch it. Enjoy the present. I\\'ve seen him in his true light now, haven\\'t I? Time to go. I must get the Chronosphere back. She cannot be far away. What a curious chap. What a gentleman. Bye bye. I can\\'t believe he just said that. Can you? Hmm. I can\\'t believe he just said that. What? Can\\'t bloody move. Wait! What\\'s he done? The blighter\\'s stuck us all at 1 minute to tea time. Tea time forever! Here you are, little ants. A nice new home. What did I tell you two? No more tarts. I didn\\'t eat any tarts. Why are these crusts under your bed? She put them there. Did you, Mirana? You did. Tell her! Tell the truth, Mirana. Did you eat the tarts and put the crusts there? No. But you did! You\\'re lying! The tarts are under your bed. Don\\'t blame your sister. No, it\\'s not fair! It\\'s not fair! The stroke of 6! The clock. She\\'ll hit her head! No! My head. Ow. Stupid roses. Oh, the princess. Oh, no. Is your head all right, miss? Careful. It\\'s swelling up. Oh, no. Iracebeth? Iracebeth! Where is she? Oh, my darling! - Daddy, my head hurts. - Arms around my neck. Mirana! Did you see that? Yes. That\\'s a nasty fall. You cannot change the past. Though I dare say, you might learn something from it. The first hat I ever made. I thought I\\'d tossed it away long, long ago. He kept it. It\\'s impossible for it to be here, and yet... here it is. So if this hat survived... then my family must have too. Higgens. Uh... Highbottom. Not here yet. No Hightopps. They\\'re alive. They\\'re alive! Your foolishness... astounds me. You have no conception of how reckless... you have been. The dangers that you have caused. What are we going to do? Quick! Where\\'s the manual? Who\\'s got the manual? I need that Chronosphere now. It must go back to the Grand Clock. But Horunvendush Day. I\\'ll only use it one more time. I must find out what happened to the Hightopps so I can rescue them. You will rescue no one. Wherever you go, I will find you. The Grand Clock must not stop. You cannot escape Time. I\\'m sorry. But I must save Hatter. Alice! Alice! Come back with my Chronosphere... It\\'s the Kingsleigh girl. The girl\\'s gone mad. Take her away. Strap her down, lads. Alice? Alice? Alice? Where am I? You\\'re in an institution. How long have I been here? Not long. You were found in an upstairs room at the Ascots\\'. Hamish had you brought here. You were behaving so strangely. They say you were trying to get under the furniture. Talking about the atmosphere? The Chronosphere! Hatter! Yes indeed, Miss Kingsleigh. I\\'ve got to go back. Now, let\\'s see. Excitable... emotional, prone to fantasy. Textbook case of female hysteria. Untreatable, some say. I beg to differ. But there\\'s nothing wrong with me. Lie back, Alice. Lie back. Dr Bennet, is it really necessary? - Surely there must be some... - Mr Harris. I can\\'t be here! Mr Harris, if you could see to Mrs Kingsleigh. I\\'ve got to go back! We have work to do. Never fear. We\\'ll have Alice fixed in no time. Where did I... Dr Bennet, I really must object. Alice. Run! No! Don\\'t let her get away! Hurry! Oh. Oh! If 3 years at sea taught me anything... it\\'s how to tie a bloody good knot. Hey! That\\'s my cab! You can\\'t take that! Sorry! I plead insanity. Hold on, Hightopps. Hightopps! No! Revenge is mine. She took them. Next time. Hatter! Hatter! Your family, they\\'re alive! He\\'s barely ticking. We fear you are too late. Hatter! He\\'s fading away. I can\\'t bear to see him like this. Come, Mally. Say your goodbyes, Alice. - Come on. - Yeah. Please wake up, Hatter. Please. Wake up. Please wake up. I know what this means now. You made it for your father when you were young. A token of your love which you thought he threw away. But he kept it all those years. He kept it. And now he needs your help. I\\'m so sorry. I thought it was impossible. I should have believed you. You believe me? I\\'ll always believe in you. It\\'s you, isn\\'t it? I\\'d know you anywhere. You\\'re Alice. Hatter. I missed you so much. So have I, dear. But if my family\\'s still alive... why have they not come home? Because they are being held captive... by the only person cruel enough to keep them locked up... all these years. Bloody Big Head. I\\'m going to find that Red Queen and bring my family home. Hello! What do you think, pets? Oh, dig, dig, dig. Work, work, work. Earthquake. Where the devil have you been? Where\\'s Alice? Where\\'s my Chronosphere? Hmm? She jumped into a looking glass. She\\'s gone. - What? You let her get away? - No. I must find her. Where is she? How should I know where she is? Because she is your enemy. She muttered... an utterance about... Hightopps. Hightopps. She said she was going to rescue them. What could this mean? I know exactly what that means. Hmm? Guards! Seize him. You see, from now on, dearest... I\\'m in charge. I\\'ve fallen off! Alice. Mirana. Oh. Oh! My family\\'s there. I know it! Good heavens! Which way is up? Oh, there\\'s a lot of stairs. Is this where we... Split up. We\\'ll split up together. It is a very large castle. Perhaps if we don\\'t split up... Oh, dear. I\\'m out of breath already. Mrs Hightopp? Hightopps? Hightopps? Zoinks! Ooh. This one\\'s locked. This one, too. This is the last room. They must be this way. I just know it. Father? Mother? Anyone? They\\'re not here? They\\'re not here. They\\'re not here. But I was certain that they were here. I could feel it. I\\'m so sorry. Father! Mother! Everyone, it\\'s you! Teeny-tiny you, but still you. Hello, Alice. Ahh! Get it! No! Thank you ever so much. You have just delivered to me the most powerful device in the entire universe. Along with your dearest friends. And my dearest enemy. Racie! Shut up! I knew we should have stayed together. Now look at us. Stuck in a giant vegetable jail. What happened to you? Wait! Your Majesty, stop! You cannot change the past. Believe me, I have tried. Oh, Alice, you always were an irksome, slurvish, interrupting thing. When I get back... I shall have the heads of all your friends. And then I shall have your head. Ta-ta. Come on. Don\\'t let her see herself. Or else she will destroy everything! I now recall why I don\\'t like her. \"How to Keep the Clock Going Yourself.\" Of course! Seconds, Minutes... Proceed to 347! It\\'s time... for the Hour! It\\'s Time. Oh, this is all my fault. I stole the Chronosphere. I think you may have to steal it again. She ate my schnozzle. \"And my fingers...\" \"...and my elbow!\" Thank you. I think you look rather fetching without your schnozzle. Absolutely radishing. Stop it. What are we going to do? Yeah, what\\'s the plan? It\\'s up to you now, Alice. Take Time to his castle. Hatter and I will retrieve the Chronosphere... and restore order to the universe. Do you understand? - Yes, of course! - Got it. What are you waiting for? Let\\'s go! Where are we? You know where we are. Why are these crusts under your bed? She put them there. Did you, Mirana? Did you, Mirana? You did. Tell her! Tell the truth, Mirana. Did you eat the tarts and put the crusts there? - No. - No. - Racie, no! - You\\'re a liar! Liar! You\\'re lying! This cannot be good. We\\'ve got to go now! She has broken the past. Only putting back the Chronosphere can save us now! It\\'s catching up. Ooh. Uh, Alice? Hold on, everyone. I don\\'t wanna hold on! The Chronosphere! She brought it back! Oh! Run, Alice! They might actually pull this off. Follow me. This way. I\\'ve got you, wee man. Oh... Tick-tock, tick-tock. Gotta save the Grand Clock. I won\\'t leave you. Sir, sir! Hold on, sir! She\\'s here! The girl who tricked you and made you look a complete idiot! Alice! Hatter! Oh. Goodbye, Brother. Brother, goodbye. I have cherished every moment with all of you. On guard! Time\\'s up. She\\'s not going to make it! She needs more time, sir! I have not ticked my last tock yet! It appears... that my invincible machine... No! is in fact... vincible. My goodness. Did I miss anything? Are you all right? Yes. Wilkins. Wilkins! - Wilkins! - Yes, sir. Oh! There you are. Stop standing around. There is much to do, hmm? You don\\'t need a butler, do you, miss? Wilkins! They did it! They did it! Hooray, Alice! I always liked that girl. Get off me! Ugh. Why does this always happen to me? Why does no one love me? I love you, Racie. No, you don\\'t! This is all your fault. I know. I ate the tarts and I lied about it. I should have just told the truth, and none of this would have ever happened. I\\'m so sorry. If it\\'s not too late... please forgive me. That\\'s all I ever wanted to hear. Really, it was. Mmm... Your Majesty... I do beg pardon for any intrusion. My family find themselves... in somewhat awkward circumstances. Of course. I always liked tiny things. Thank you. Not too much now. Be careful. Outstanding, my boy. Well done. Oh, my family. My dear family. Mother. You, Father. You kept my blue hat. I make hats, Father. I\\'m a hatter. I always knew you were, my boy. All is well. Yes? I know you tried to warn me. But I didn\\'t listen. I\\'m sorry. I used to think Time was a thief... stealing everything I loved. But I see now that you give before you take. And every day is a gift. Every hour, every minute, every second. Ah. The fallen soldier. I suppose you want me to fix it. No. I want you to have it. He used to say the only thing worth doing... was what we do for others. I think he would have liked you. Hmm? It is said that Time is a friend to no man. But I will remember you always. And please... do not come back. Alice. Oh, Alice. You simply must come and meet my family. After all, you are the very person who saved them, aren\\'t you? We\\'re going to have so much fun together. Oh. But, of course, you have a family of your own... don\\'t you? Very important thing, a family. You only get the one. Oh, Hatter. I fear I may never see you again. My dear Alice. In the gardens of memory... in the palace of dreams... that is where you and I will meet. But a dream is not reality. Who\\'s to say which is which? You did it, Alice. An impossible thing. Not as impossible as saying goodbye to you, my friends. Goodbye, Hatter. Goodbye, Alice. Now, please. The deed to your husband\\'s ship. Just sign here... and the house is yours. Mr Harcourt... time is money. I\\'m afraid he most certainly is not. Alice! Time is many things, Hamish, but he isn\\'t money. Nor is he our enemy, Mother. Where did you come from? I walked right through the walls. Poof! I may not be able to change the past, but I can learn from it. Sign the papers, Mother. You want me to sign them? But what about the Wonder? It\\'s just a ship. There\\'s always another. But you are my mother, and I only have one. So you\\'ve decided to be a clerk? I knew that you would. Headstrong or not. You\\'re not a nice man, Hamish. I\\'m glad my daughter didn\\'t marry you. Mrs Kingsleigh. Mrs Kingsleigh! No, you can\\'t! You can\\'t! You can\\'t! Alice can do whatever Alice chooses. And so can I. Good day. Mother! Higher. Higher. Perfect! Thank you, gentlemen. We\\'ll run the Ascots out of business in a year. Mother! A full cargo aboard, Captain. Shall we commence with Kingsleigh and Kingsleigh\\'s maiden voyage? Time and tide wait for no man, Mr Harcourt. Or, indeed, woman. Captain aboard. Full sail. I know that I\\'m running out of time I want it all Mmm, mmm And I\\'m wishing they\\'d stop trying to turn me off I want it on Mmm, mmm And I\\'m walking on a wire Trying to go higher Feels like I\\'m surrounded by clowns and liars Even when I give it all away I want it all Mmm, mmm We came here to run it Run it, run it Just like fire, burning out the way If I can light the world up for just one day Watch this madness, colourful charade No one can be just like me anyway Just like magic I\\'ll be flying free I\\'mma disappear when they come for me I\\'ll kick that ceiling What you gonna say? No one can be just like me anyway And people like to laugh at you cause they are all the same Mmm, mmm See I would rather we just go our different way than play the game Mmm, mmm And no matter the weather We can do it better You and me together Forever and ever We don\\'t have to worry \\'bout a thing, \\'bout a thing No We came here to run it Run it, run it We came here to run it Run it, run it Oh! Just like magic I\\'ll be flying free I\\'mma disappear when they come for me I\\'ll kick that ceiling What you gonna say?

Every superhero has a secret identity. I don\\'t know a single one who doesn\\'t. Who wants the pressure of being super all the time? Of course I have a secret identity. Can you see me in this at the supermarket? Come on. Who\\'d want to go shopping as Elastigirl, know what I mean? Superladies, they\\'re always trying to tell you their secret identity. Think it\\'ll strengthen the relationship or something. I said, \"Girl, I don\\'t want to know about your mild-mannered alter ego.\" I mean, you tell me you\\'re a super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe, that\\'s all right with me. I\\'m good. I\\'m good. No matter how many times you save the world, it always manages to get back in jeopardy again. Sometimes I just want it to stay saved, you know? For a little bit. I feel like the maid. \"I just cleaned up this mess. Can we keep it clean for ten minutes?\" I could get to that point. - \"Please?\" - We\\'re not finished. Sometimes I think I\\'d just like the simple life, you know? Relax a little and raise a family. Settle down? Are you kidding? I\\'m at the top of my game! I\\'m up there with the big dogs! Girls, come on. Leave the saving of the world to the men? I don\\'t think so. I don\\'t think so. We interrupt for a bulletin. A high-speed pursuit between police and armed gunmen is underway, traveling northbound on San Pablo Ave. Yeah, I\\'ve got time. Mr. Incredible. - What is it, ma\\'am? - My cat, Squeaker, won\\'t come down. Certainly. I suggest you stand clear. There could be trouble. No, he\\'s quite tame. Let go now. Thank you, Mr. Incredible. You\\'ve done it again. - You\\'re the best. - No, I\\'m just here to help. All units. We have a tour bus robbery... Tour bus robbery. I\\'ve still got time. Officers. Ma\\'am. Squeaker. - Cool! Ready for take-off! - What the...? - Who are you supposed to be? - I\\'m IncrediBoy. What? No. You\\'re that kid from the fan club. Brophy. Brody. Buddy! Buddy! My name is IncrediBoy. I\\'ve been nice, I\\'ve stood for photos, signed every scrap of paper you pushed at me... No, don\\'t worry about training me. I know your moves, crime fighting style, favorite catch phrases, everything! I\\'m your number one fan! Hey! Hey, wait! You know... ...you can tell a lot about a woman by the contents of her purse, but maybe that\\'s not what you had in mind. Hey, look... Elastigirl. Mr. Incredible. - It\\'s all right. I\\'ve got him. - Sure, you\\'ve got him. - I just took him out for you. - Sure, you did. - His attention was on me. - A fact I exploited to do my job. - My job, you mean. - A simple thank you will suffice. Thanks, but I don\\'t need any help. Whatever happened to \"ladies first\"? Well, whatever happened to equal treatment? Look, the lady got me first. - Well, we could share, you know. - I work alone. Well, I think you need to be more... ...flexible. Are you doing anything later? I have a previous engagement. Now, you just stay here. They usually pick up the garbage in an hour. - Hey, Incredible! - Hey, Frozone! - Shouldn\\'t you be getting ready? - I still got time. He\\'s gonna jump! I think you broke something. With counseling, I think you\\'ll come to forgive me. Wait a minute. Bomb Voyage. And IncrediBoy! IncrediBoy? Aren\\'t you curious about how I get around so fast? I have rocket boots. - Go home, Buddy. Now. - What? Can we talk? You always say be true to yourself, but you never say which part to be true to. Well, I\\'ve finally figured out who I am. I am your ward... IncrediBoy! And now, you have officially carried it too far, Buddy. This is because I don\\'t have powers, isn\\'t it? Not every superhero has powers, you know. You can be super without them. I invented these. I can fly. Can you fly? Fly home, Buddy. I work alone. Just give me one chance! I\\'ll show you. I\\'ll go get the police. - Buddy, don\\'t! - It\\'ll only take a second, really. No, stop! There\\'s a bomb! Let go, you\\'re wrecking my flight pattern. - I can do this if you let go! - Will you just...? - I\\'m trying to help! Stop! - Let go of my cape! Take this one home. And make sure his mom knows what he\\'s been doing. I can help you. You\\'re making a mist... The injured jumper. You sent paramedics? They picked him up. The blast in that building was caused by Bomb Voyage who I caught robbing the vault. We might nab him if we set up a perimeter. - He got away? - Well, yeah. - Skippy here made sure of that. - IncrediBoy. You\\'re not affiliated with me! Holy smokes, I\\'m late. Listen, I\\'ve gotta be somewhere. - What about Bomb Voyage? - Any other night, I\\'d go after him, but I really gotta go. Don\\'t worry. We\\'ll get him! Eventually! - Is the night still young? - You\\'re very late. - How do I look? Good? - The mask. You still got the mask. Showtime. Robert Parr, will you have this woman to be your lawful wedded wife? You\\'re late. When you asked if I was doing anything later, I didn\\'t realize you\\'d forgotten. I thought it was playful banter. - It was. - Cutting it close, don\\'t you think? You need to be more... flexible. I love you, but if we\\'re gonna make this work, you\\'ve gotta be more than Mr. Incredible. You know that. Don\\'t you? ...so long as you both shall live? - I do. I pronounce this couple husband and wife. As long as we both shall live. No matter what happens. Hey, come on. We\\'re superheroes. What could happen? In a stunning turn of events, a superhero is being sued for saving someone who, apparently, didn\\'t want to be saved. The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet, who was foiled in his attempted suicide by Mr. Incredible, has filed suit against the famed superhero in Superior Court. Mr. Sansweet didn\\'t ask to be saved. He didn\\'t want to be saved. The injury received from Mr. Incredible\\'s \"actions\", - Causes him daily pain. - I saved your life! You didn\\'t save my life! You ruined my death. My client has no comment. Another suit was filed by victims of the el train accident. Incredible\\'s court losses cost the government millions. And opened the flood gates for dozens of superhero lawsuits the world over. It is time for their secret identity to become their only identity. Time for them to join us, or go away. Under public pressure, and the financial burden of an ever mounting series of lawsuits, the government quietly initiated the superhero relocation program. The supers were granted amnesty from responsibility for past actions, in exchange for the promise to never again resume hero work. Where are they now? They are living among us. Average citizens, average heroes. Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place. Denied? You\\'re denying my claim? I don\\'t understand. I have full coverage. I\\'m sorry, Mrs. Hogenson, but our liability is spelled out in paragraph 17. - It states clearly... - I can\\'t pay for this. Excuse me. Claims, Bob Parr. I\\'m calling to celebrate a momentous occasion. We\\'re now officially moved in. Yeah, well, that\\'s great, honey. The last three years don\\'t count because... Because I finally unpacked the last box. Now, it\\'s official. Ha, ha, ha. - Why do we have so much junk? - Listen, I\\'ve got a client. Say no more. Go save the world one policy at a time, honey. Oh! I gotta go pick up the kids. See you tonight. Bye, honey. Excuse me. Where were we? I\\'m on a fixed income, and if you can\\'t help me, I don\\'t know what I\\'ll do. All right, listen closely. I\\'d like to help you, but I can\\'t. I\\'d like to tell you to take a copy of your policy to Norma Wilcox on... Norma Wilcox. W-I-L-C-O-X. On the third floor. But I can\\'t. I also do not advise you to fill out and file a WS2475 form with our legal department on the second floor. I wouldn\\'t expect someone to get back to you quickly to resolve the matter. I\\'d like to help, but there\\'s nothing I can do. - Oh, thank you, young man. - Sorry. I know you\\'re upset! Pretend to be upset. Parr! You authorized payment on the Walker policy! Someone broke into their house, Mr. Huph. - Their policy covers... - I don\\'t wanna know about it. Don\\'t tell me about it. Tell me how you\\'re keeping Insuricare in the black. Tell me how that\\'s possible, with you writing checks to every Harry Hardluck and Sally Sobstory that gives you a phone call. Morning break is over. Morning break is over. I appreciate you coming down here, Mrs. Parr. What\\'s this about? Has Dash done something wrong? He\\'s a disruptive influence and he openly mocks me in front of the class. - He says. - Look, I know it\\'s you! - He puts thumbtacks on my stool. - You saw him do this? Well... not really. No. Actually, not. Oh, then how do you know it was him? I hid a camera. Yeah, and this time, I\\'ve got him. See? You see? You don\\'t see it? He moves! Right there! Wait, wait! Right there! Right as I\\'m sitting down! I don\\'t know how he does it, but there\\'s no tack before he moves and after he moves, there\\'s a tack. Coincidence? I think not! - Bernie... - Don\\'t \"Bernie\" me. This little rat is guilty! You and your son can go now, Mrs. Parr. I\\'m sorry for the trouble. You\\'re letting him go again? He\\'s guilty! You can see it on his smug little face. Guilty, I say, guilty! Dash, this is the third time this year you\\'ve been sent to the office. We need to find a better outlet. A more... constructive outlet. Maybe I could, if you\\'d let me go out for sports. Honey, you know why we can\\'t do that. I promise I\\'ll slow up. I\\'ll only be the best by a tiny bit. Dashiell Robert Parr, you are an incredibly competitive boy. And a bit of a showoff. The last thing you need is temptation. You always say, \"Do your best.\" But you don\\'t really mean it. Why can\\'t I do the best that I can do? Right now, honey, the world just wants us to fit in, and to fit in, we just gotta be like everybody else. Dad always said our powers were nothing to be ashamed of. - Our powers made us special. - Everyone\\'s special, Dash. Which is another way of saying no one is. Rydinger, where you headed? - Hi, Tony. - Hey. - Hey, Tony, can I carry your books? - That\\'s kind of funny. Hey, Tony, do you play football? Tony, I thought we were gonna go swimming. He looked at me. Come on, Violet! Darn kids. Sitting on the driveway... Oh, great. Mom. - You\\'re making weird faces again. - No, I\\'m not. You make weird faces, honey. - Do you have to read at the table? - Uh-huh. Yeah. Smaller bites, Dash. Yikes! Bob, could you help the carnivore cut his meat. Dash, you have something you wanna tell your father about school? - Well, we dissected a frog. - Dash got sent to the office again. - Good. Good. - No, Bob, that\\'s bad. - What? - Dash got sent to the office again. - What?! What for? - Nothing. He put a tack on the teacher\\'s chair... during class. Nobody saw me. You could barely see it on the tape. They caught you on tape and you still got away with it? Whoa! You must have been booking. How fast were you going? We are not encouraging this. I\\'m not, I\\'m just asking how fast... Honey! Great. First the car, now I gotta pay to fix the table... What happened to the car? Here. I\\'m getting a new plate. So, how about you, Vi? How was school? - Nothing to report. - You\\'ve hardly touched your food. - I\\'m not hungry for meatloaf. - Well, it is leftover night. We have steak, pasta... What are you hungry for? - Tony Rydinger. - Shut up. - Well, you are. - I said, shut up, you little insect. - Well, she is. - Do not shout at the table. - Honey! - Kids! Listen to your mother. She\\'d eat if we were having Tony loaf. That\\'s it! Stop it! - You\\'re gonna be toast! - Stop running in the house. Sit down! - Hey, no force fields! - You started it. You sit down! You sit down! Violet! \"Simon J. Paladino, longtime advocate of superhero rights, is missing\"? - Gazerbeam. - Bob! It\\'s time to engage. Do something! Don\\'t just stand there! - I need you to intervene! - You want me to intervene? Okay. I\\'m intervening! Violet, let go of your brother. Hello? Get the door. - Hey, Lucius! - Hey, Speedo. Helen, Vi, Jack-Jack. - Ice of you to drop by. - Ha! Never heard that one before. - Lucius! - Whoa! - Ha, ha. - Oh! - I like it when it shatters. - I\\'ll be back later. - Where are you two going? - It\\'s Wednesday. Bowling night. Say hello to Honey for me, Lucius. Will do. Good night, Helen. Good night, kids. Don\\'t think you\\'ve avoided talking about the principal\\'s office. Your father and I are still gonna discuss it. I\\'m not the only kid who\\'s been sent to the office. Other kids don\\'t have superpowers. - Now, it\\'s perfectly normal... - What do you know about normal? What does anyone in this family know about normal? - Now, wait a minute, young lady. - We act normal. I wanna be normal. The only normal one is Jack-Jack, and he\\'s not even toilet trained. Lucky. I meant about being normal. So now I\\'m in deep trouble. I mean, one more jolt of this death ray and I\\'m an epitaph. Somehow I managed to find cover. What does Baron Von Ruthless do? - He starts monologuing. - He starts monologuing. He starts this prepared speech about how feeble I am compared to him. How inevitable my defeat is, the world will soon be his. Yada, yada, yada. - Yammering. - Yammering. I mean, the guy has me on a platter, and he won\\'t shut up. - Municiberg, we have a 23-56... - 23-56, what is that? - Robbery? - This is just sad. - Want to catch a robber? - No. Tell you the truth, I\\'d rather go bowling. Look, what if we actually did what our wives think we\\'re doing? Just to shake things up. He\\'s not alone. The fat guy\\'s still with him. They\\'re just talking. - What are we doing here? - Protecting people. - Nobody asked us. - You need an invitation? I\\'d like one, yes. We keep sneaking out to do this, and... - You remember Gazerbeam? - There was something in the paper. - He had trouble with civilian life. - When did you see him? I don\\'t see anyone from the old days. Just you. - And we\\'re pushing our luck as it is. - Come on. It was fun the first time, but if we keep doing this... - We have a report on a fire... - A fire. We\\'re close! - Yeah, baby! - We\\'re gonna get caught. Fire! Yeah! - Is that everybody? - Yeah. - It better be. - Can\\'t you put this out? I can\\'t lay down a layer thick enough! It\\'s evaporating too fast! - What\\'s that mean? - It means it\\'s hot. - I\\'m dehydrated, Bob. - You\\'re out of ice? You can\\'t run out. You can use water in the air. There is no water in this air! What\\'s your excuse, run out of muscle? I can\\'t smash walls. The building\\'s getting weaker. - It\\'s gonna come down on top of us. - I wanted to go bowling! All right! Stay right on my tail! This is gonna get hot! Yeah. Uh-oh. Oh, good. That ain\\'t right. - We look like incompetent bad guys! - You can get water out of the air. Freeze! Freeze! - I\\'m thirsty. - I said freeze! I\\'m just getting a drink. - You\\'ve had your drink. Now... - I know. I know. Freeze. Police officers! That was way too close. We are not doing that again. Verify you want to switch targets? Over. Trust me. This is the one he\\'s been looking for. - I thought you\\'d be back by 11. - I said I\\'d be back later. I assumed you\\'d be back later. If you came back at all... ...you\\'d be \"back later\". - Well, I\\'m back, okay? Is this rubble? It was just a little workout. Just to stay loose. You know how I feel about that. Darn you! We can\\'t blow cover again. - The building was coming down anyway. - What? You knocked down a building? It was on fire. Structurally unsound. It was coming down. Have you been listening to the police scanner again? I performed a public service. You act like that\\'s a bad thing. It is a bad thing, Bob! Uprooting our family again, so you can relive the glory days is a bad thing. It\\'s better than acting like they didn\\'t happen! Yes! They happened! But this, our family, is what\\'s happening now, Bob. And you are missing this! I can\\'t believe you don\\'t want to go to your own son\\'s graduation. It\\'s not a graduation. He\\'s moving from fourth to fifth grade. - It\\'s a ceremony! - It\\'s psychotic! They keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity but if someone is exceptional... This is not about you, Bob. It\\'s about Dash. You want to do something for Dash? Let him actually compete. - Let him go out for sports! - I will not be made the enemy! - You know why we can\\'t do that. - Because he\\'d be great. This is not about you! All right, Dash. I know you\\'re listening. Come on out. Vi? You, too, young lady. Come on. Come on out. It\\'s okay, kids. We\\'re just having a discussion. Pretty loud discussion. But that\\'s okay. What\\'s important is that Mommy and I are a team. - We\\'re united, uh, against forces of... - Pigheadedness? - I was gonna say evil. - We\\'re sorry we woke you. Everything\\'s okay. Go back to bed. It\\'s late. - Good night, Mom. Night, Dad. - Good night. In fact, we should all be in bed. Request claim on claim numbers 158183... Request claim on claim numbers 158183... Haven\\'t you got him yet? Where is he? Mr. Huph would like to talk to you in his office. - Now? - Now. Sit down, Bob. I\\'m not happy, Bob. Not happy. - Ask me why. - Okay. Why? Why what? Be specific, Bob. Why are you unhappy? Your customers make me unhappy. What, you\\'ve gotten complaints? Complaints I can handle. What I can\\'t handle is your customers\\' inexplicable knowledge of Insuricare\\'s inner workings! They\\'re experts. Experts, Bob! Exploiting every loophole, dodging every obstacle! They\\'re penetrating the bureaucracy! - Did I do something illegal? - No. - We shouldn\\'t help our customers? - The law requires that I answer no. - We\\'re supposed to help people. - Help our people! Starting with our stockholders. Who\\'s helping them out, huh? You know, Bob, a company... Is like an enormous clock. ...is like an enormous... Yes. Precisely. It only works if all the little cogs mesh together. Now, a clock needs to be cleaned, well-lubricated and wound tight. The best clocks have jewel movements, cogs that fit, that cooperate by design. I\\'m being metaphorical, Bob. Know what I mean by cooperative cogs? Bob? Bob? Look at me when I\\'m talking to you, Parr. - That man out there, he needs help. - Don\\'t change the subject. - We\\'re discussing your attitude. - He is getting mugged! - Well, let\\'s hope we don\\'t cover him. - I\\'ll be right back. Stop right now or you\\'re fired! Close the door. Get over here, now. I\\'m not happy, Bob. Not happy. - He got away. - Good thing, too. You were this close to losing your... Uh-oh. Please report to operating room 722 immediately. - How is he? - He\\'ll live. - I\\'m fired, aren\\'t I? - You think? - What can I say, Rick? - Nothing you haven\\'t said before. - Someone was in trouble. - Always. - I had to do something. - Every time you say that, it\\'s a month and a half of trouble for me. Hundreds of thousands of taxpayer\\'s dollars. - I know. - We pay to keep the company quiet. We pay damages, erase memories, relocate your family. Every time it gets harder. Money, money, money. We can\\'t keep doing this. We appreciate what you did in the old days, but those days are over. From now on, you\\'re on your own. Listen, Bob. Maybe I could relocate you, you know, for old times\\' sake. I can\\'t do that to my family. Everyone just got settled. I\\'ll make it work. Thanks. Take care of yourself. What are you waiting for? I don\\'t know. Something amazing, I guess. Me, too, kid. Huh? \"Hold still\"? Match: Mr. Incredible. Room is secure. Commence message. Hello, Mr. Incredible. Yes, we know who you are. Rest assured, your secret is safe with us. My name is Mirage. We have something in common. According to the government, neither of us exist. Please pay attention, as this message is classified and will not be repeated. I represent a top secret division of the government, designing and testing experimental technology, and we have need of your unique abilities. Something happened at our testing facility. - Honey! - Huh? What? - Dinner\\'s ready. - Okay. ...it is contained within an isolated area, it threatens to cause incalculable damage to itself and our facilities, jeopardizing hundreds of millions of dollars... Is someone in there? - It\\'s the TV, trying to watch. - Because of its sensitive nature... - Stop. It\\'s time for dinner. - One minute! If you accept, your payment will be triple your current annual salary. Call the number on the card. Voice-matching will ensure security. The supers aren\\'t gone, Mr. Incredible. You\\'re still here. You can still do great things. Or... ...you can listen to police scanners. Your choice. You have 24 hours to respond. Think about it. This message will self-destruct. Uh-oh. You are one distracted guy. Am I? I don\\'t mean to be. I know you miss being a hero and your job is frustrating. I just want you to know how much it means to me that you stay at it anyway. - Honey? About the job? - What? - Something\\'s happened. - What? - The, uh... - What? The company is sending me to, uh, a conference. - A conference? - Out of town. I\\'m gonna be gone for a few days. They\\'ve never sent you to a conference before. This is good, isn\\'t it? Yes. You see? They\\'re finally recognizing your talents. - You\\'re moving up. - Yes. - Honey! This is wonderful! - Yes, it is. Hello? This is Mr. Incredible. I\\'m in. The Omnidroid 9000 is a top secret prototype battle robot. Its artificial intelligence enables it to solve any problem it\\'s confronted with. And, unfortunately... Let me guess. It got smart enough to wonder why it had to take orders. We lost control. Now it\\'s loose in the jungle, threatening our facility. We\\'ve had to evacuate all personnel from the island for their own safety. How am I going in? The Omnidroid\\'s defenses necessitate an air drop from 5000 feet. Its cloaking devices make it difficult to track. We\\'re pretty sure it\\'s on the southern half of the island. One more thing. Obviously it represents a significant investment. You want me to shut it down without destroying it. You are Mr. Incredible. I\\'ve got to warn you, it\\'s a learning robot. Every moment you fight it increases its knowledge of how to beat you. Shut it down. Do it quickly. Don\\'t destroy it. - And don\\'t die. - Great. Thanks. Showtime. Huh? Hmm. Oh, my back! Surprising. We must bring him back. Sound the all clear, and invite him to dinner. Most important, keep things light. Praise him. Make him feel like we appreciate his abilities. Am I overdressed? Actually, you look rather dashing. - I take it our host is... - I\\'m sorry. He won\\'t be dining with us. He hopes you\\'ll understand. Of course. I do usually make it a point to know who I\\'m working for. He prefers a certain amount of anonymity. Surely, you of all people understand that. I was just wondering, of all the places to settle down, why live... With a volcano? He\\'s attracted to power. So am I. - It\\'s a weakness we share. - Seems a bit unstable. I prefer to think of it as misunderstood. Aren\\'t we all? Volcanic soil is among the most fertile on Earth. Everything at the table was grown right here. - How does it compare? - Everything\\'s delicious. - Jeez. - Hurry, honey. Or you\\'ll be late for work. - Have a great day, honey. - Thanks. - Help customers, climb ladders... - Bring bacon. All that jazz. You have an appointment? I\\'m an old friend. I just wanted to... - All visitors are required... - Go check the electric fence. What is it? Who are you? What do you want? My God, you\\'ve gotten fat. Come in. Come, come. Yes, things are going quite well. Quite well. My God, no complaints. But, you know, it is not the same. Not the same at all. Weren\\'t you in the news? Some show in Prayge... Prague? Milan, darling. Milan. Supermodels. Nothing super about them. Spoiled, stupid, little stick figures with poofy lips who think only about themselves. Feh! I used to design for gods. But perhaps you come with a challenge, eh? I was surprised to get your call. E, I just need a patch job. Hmm. This is megamesh. Outmoded, but very sturdy. And you\\'ve torn right through it! What have you been doing, Robert? Moonlighting hero work? Must have happened a long time ago. I see. This is a hobo suit, darling. You can\\'t be seen in this. I won\\'t allow it! - Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now? - What do you mean? You designed it. I never look back, darling. It distracts from the now. You need a new suit. That much is certain. A new suit? Where the heck am I gonna get a new suit? You can\\'t! It\\'s impossible! I\\'m far too busy. So ask me now, before I again become sane. Wait. You want to make me a suit? You push too hard, darling! But I accept. - It will be bold. Dramatic! - Yeah. - Heroic! - Yeah, something classic, like Dynaguy! Oh! He had a great look! Oh, the cape and the boots... No capes! - Isn\\'t that my decision? - Do you remember Thunderhead? Tall, storm powers. Nice man. Good with kids. - Listen, E... - November 15th of \\'58. All was well, another day saved when his cape snagged on a missile fin. Thunderhead was not the brightest bulb... Stratogale! April 23rd, \\'57. Cape caught in a jet turbine. You can\\'t generalize about these things. Meta-man. Express elevator. Dynaguy, snag on takeoff. Splashdown, sucked into a vortex. No capes! Now, go on. Your new suit will be finished before your next assignment. You know I\\'m retired from hero work. As am I, Robert. Yet, here we are. E, I only need a patch job. For sentimental reasons. Fine. I will also fix the hobo suit. - You\\'re the best of the best, E. - Yes, I know, darling. I know. Don\\'t answer it, honey, I got it! - Hello? - We have a new assignment for you. - How soon can you get here? - I\\'ll leave tomorrow morning. - See you there. - Goodbye. Who was that, honey? The, uh, office? Another conference. Short notice, but you know... ...duty calls. - Bob? - Yeah, what\\'s up, honey? - Ha... have a great trip. - Thanks, sweetie. - I\\'ll call you when I get there. - I love you. - So much. - I love you too. This is your automated Captain. Would you care for more mimosa? - Don\\'t mind if I do. Thanks. - You\\'re welcome. Currently 78 degrees in Nomanisan. Perfect weather for flying. Please fasten your seat belt. We\\'re beginning our descent. Hello, Mr. Incredible. Nice suit. Thanks. Nice to be back, Mirage. You\\'ll be briefed on your assignment in the conference room at two. - D Wing, room A-113. - 2:00. Got it. See you there. Edna. - I\\'d like to speak to Edna, please. - This is Edna. - E? This is Helen. - Helen who? Helen Parr? You know... Elastigirl? Darling! It\\'s been such a long time after all these years! So long! It\\'s been a while. There\\'s only one person Bob would trust to patch his supersuit. That\\'s you. Yes, yes, yes. Marvelous, isn\\'t it? Much better than those horrible pajamas he used to wear. They are finished. When are you coming to see? - I\\'m calling about... - Don\\'t make me beg. - I won\\'t do it, you know. - Beg, no, I\\'m calling about suit. Bob\\'s suit! I\\'m calling about Bob\\'s suit. You come in one hour, darling. I insist, okay? Okay. Goodbye. Hmm. It\\'s bigger! It\\'s badder! Ladies and gentlemen, it\\'s too much for Mr. Incredible! It\\'s finally ready. You know, I went through quite a few supers to get it worthy to fight you, but man, it wasn\\'t good enough! After you trashed the last one, I had to make some major modifications. Sure it was difficult, but you are worth it. I mean, after all, I am your biggest fan. - Buddy? - My name is not Buddy! And it\\'s not IncrediBoy either! That ship has sailed. All I wanted was to help you. I only wanted to help! And what did you say to me? Fly home, Buddy. I work alone. It tore me apart. But I learned an important lesson. You can\\'t count on anyone. Especially your heroes. I was wrong to treat you that way. I\\'m sorry. See? Now you respect me, because I\\'m a threat. That\\'s the way it works. There\\'s a lot of people, whole countries who want respect. And they will pay through the nose to get it. How do you think I got rich? I invented weapons. Now I have a weapon only I can defeat. And when I unleash it, I\\'ll get... You sly dog! You got me monologuing. I can\\'t believe it. It\\'s cool, huh? Zero-point energy. I save the best inventions for myself. Am I good enough now? Who\\'s super now? I\\'m Syndrome! Your nemesis and... Oh, brilliant! All right, try this one on for size, big boy. Gazerbeam. \"Kronos?\" Life reading negative. Mr. Incredible terminated. This project has completely confiscated my life, darling. Consumed me as only hero work can. My best work, I must admit. Simple, elegant, yet bold. You will die. - E, I just... - I did Robert\\'s suit, and it turned out so beautiful, I had to continue. It\\'s great to see you, but I have no idea what you\\'re talking about. - I just... - Yes, words are useless. Gobble, gobble, gobble. Too much of it, darling. Too much! That is why I show you my work. That is why you are here. Edna Mode. And guest. Come. Sit. - Cream and sugar? - Thanks. - I started with the baby. - Started? Shh! Darling! I cut it a little roomy for the free movement. The fabric is comfortable for sensitive skin, and can also withstand a temperature of over 1000 degrees. Completely bulletproof. And machine washable, darling. That\\'s a new feature. What on earth do you think the baby will be doing? Well, I\\'m sure I don\\'t know, darling. Luck favors the prepared. I didn\\'t know the baby\\'s powers, so I covered the basics. - Jack-Jack doesn\\'t have any powers. - No? Well, he\\'ll look fabulous anyway. Your boy\\'s suit I designed to withstand enormous friction without heating up or wearing out. A useful feature. Your daughter\\'s suit was tricky. I finally created a sturdy material that will disappear completely as she does. Your suit can stretch as far as you can, without injuring yourself, and still retain its shape. Virtually indestructible... ...yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton. As an extra feature, each suit contains a homing device, giving you the precise global location of the wearer at the touch of a button. Well, darling? What do you think? What do I think? Bob is retired! I\\'m retired! Our family is underground. You helped my husband resume secret hero work behind my back? Well, I assumed you knew, darling. Why would he keep secrets from you? He wouldn\\'t. Didn\\'t. Doesn\\'t. Men at Robert\\'s age are often unstable. Prone to weakness. - What are you saying? - Do you know where he is? - Of course. - Do you know where he is? - Hey, hey. We got a man down! - Come on, let\\'s go. Are you okay? What happened? Break surveillance and engage. Continuing sweep... - Insuricare. - Oh, hello. This is Helen Parr. Bob Parr is my husband. I was wondering if you could give me the number of the hotel he\\'s staying at? The number I have is no good. - Mr. Parr no longer works here. - What do you mean? He\\'s on a business trip. A company retreat. My records say he was terminated almost two months ago. So, you don\\'t know where he is. Would you like to find out? I am such an idiot. I let this happen, you know. The new sports car, the getting in shape, the blond hair, the lies. Yes, he attempts to relive the past. Now I\\'m losing him! What\\'ll I do? What\\'ll I do? What are you talking about? You are Elastigirl! My God! Pull yourself together. What will you do? Is this a question? Show him you remember that he is Mr. Incredible, and you will remind him who you are! Well, you know where he is. Go! Confront the problem! Fight! Win! And call me when you get back, darling. I enjoy our visits. There\\'s lots of leftovers that you can reheat. Make sure Dash does his homework. And both of you, get to bed on time. I should be back tonight. Late. You can be in charge that long, can\\'t you? Yeah. But why am I in charge again? Nothing. Just a little trouble with Daddy. You mean Dad\\'s in trouble, or Dad is the trouble? I mean either he\\'s in trouble, or he\\'s going to be. What\\'s that? Where\\'d you get that, Mom? You made a cool outfit? Hey, are those for us? We all get cool outfits? Dash! You come back here this moment! Hey, Snug. Thanks for getting back. I know this is short notice, but I was hoping that I could... - What are these? - Look, I\\'m The Dash! - The Dash likes. - Just a second. - Take that off before somebody sees. - You\\'re packing one just like it. - Are you hiding something? - Please. I\\'m on the phone... - Dash! - This is yours. It\\'s specially made. - What\\'s going on? - You\\'re not coming! I gotta pack! What makes you think it\\'s special? I don\\'t know. Why\\'d Mom try to hide it? Snug, I\\'m calling in a solid you owe me. - What do you need? - A jet. What do you got that\\'s fast? Let me think. Island approach. India Golf niner-niner checking in. VFR on top. Over. Island tower, this is India Golf niner-niner Requesting vectors to the initial. Easy, Helen. Easy. Easy, girl. You\\'re overreacting. Everything\\'s fine. They\\'re just all getting coffee. At the same time. Yeah. You sir, truly are \"Mr. Incredible\". I was right to idolize you. I always knew you were tough, but tricking the probe by hiding under the bones of another super? Oh, man! I\\'m still geeking out about it! And then you had to just go and ruin the ride. I mean, Mr. Incredible calling for help? \"Help me, help me.\" Lame, lame, lame. - All right, who did you contact? - Contact? What are you talking about? I am referring to last night at 2307 hours while you were snooping around. You sent out a homing signal. I didn\\'t know about the homing device. And now a government plane is requesting permission to land here. - Who did you contact? - I didn\\'t send for a plane. Play the transmission. - India golf checking in. - Helen! So you do know these people. Well, then, I\\'ll send them a little greeting. - Ow! - Violet! It\\'s not my fault. Dash ran away, I knew I\\'d get blamed for it. That\\'s not true! You said, \"Something\\'s up with Mom. We have to find out what. ...and it\\'s not my fault! - Hundred percent all-yours idea! Wait a minute. You left Jack-Jack alone? - Of course we got a sitter. - We got someone, Mom. - We wouldn\\'t do that. - Thanks a lot! All right, well, who\\'d you get? You don\\'t have to worry about one thing. I\\'ve got baby-sitting wired. I\\'ve taken courses, learned CPR, - Excellent marks and certificates. - Kari. I brought Mozart to play while he sleeps because leading experts say Mozart makes babies smarter. Kari... The beauty is they don\\'t have to listen \\'cause they\\'re asleep! I wish my parents played Mozart because half the time I don\\'t know what anyone\\'s talking about. Kari, I really don\\'t feel comfortable with this. I\\'ll pay you for your trouble, but I\\'d rather call a service. There\\'s really no need, Mrs. Parr. I can totally handle anything this baby can dish out. Can\\'t I, little baby? I can handle it. Who can handle it? India Golf niner-niner transmitting in the blind guard. Disengage. Repeat, disengage. Repeat, disengage. Friendlies... No! Call off the missiles. I\\'ll do anything. Too late. Fifteen years too late. Friendlies two-zero miles south-southwest of your position. Angels 10. Track east. Disengage. Vi! Put a force field around the plane. You said not to use our powers. I know what I said. Listen to what I\\'m saying now! Disengage. Repeat, disengage! - Mom? - Violet! Mayday. India Golf niner-niner is buddy-spiked. Abort! There are children aboard. - There are children aboard! - No! - Put a field around us now! - I\\'ve never done one that big. Do it now! Abort, abort, abort! Abort, abort, abort! Brace yourselves! - Mom! - Everybody calm down. I\\'ll tell you what we\\'re not gonna do. We\\'re not gonna panic, we\\'re not... Look out! - Oh, my God! Who\\'s idea was this? - What are we gonna do? We\\'re dead! We\\'re dead! - It blew up! - We survived but we\\'re dead! Stop it! We are not gonna die! Both of you will get a grip. Or so help me I will ground you for a month! Understand? We have a confirmed hit. Target was destroyed. Ah, you\\'ll get over it. I seem to recall you prefer to \"work alone\". Release me. Now! - Or what? - I\\'ll crush her. That sounds a little dark for you. Well, go ahead. It\\'ll be easy. Like breaking a toothpick. Show me. I knew you couldn\\'t do it. Even when you have nothing to lose. You\\'re weak. And I\\'ve outgrown you. Those were short-range missiles. Land-based. That way is our best bet. You want to go toward the people that tried to kill us? - If it means land, yes. - Do you expect us to swim there? I expect you to trust me. What a trooper. I\\'m so proud of you. Thanks, Mom. I think your father is in trouble. If you haven\\'t noticed, we\\'re not doing so hot either. I\\'m going to look for him. And that means you\\'re in charge until I get back, Violet. - What? - You heard her. Put these on. Your identity is your most valuable possession. Protect it. And if anything goes wrong, use your powers. - But you said never to use... - I know what I said! Remember the bad guys on those shows you used to watch on Saturday mornings? Well, these guys are not like those guys. They won\\'t exercise restraint because you\\'re children. They will kill you if they get the chance. Do not give them that chance. - Mom? - Vi, I\\'m counting on you. - There\\'s... - I\\'m counting on you. Be strong. Dash, if anything goes wrong, I want you to run as fast as you can. - As fast as I can? - As fast as you can. Stay hidden. Keep each other safe. I\\'ll be back by morning. Mom! Mom, what happened on the plane. I\\'m sorry. I wanted to help. When you asked me to... I\\'m sorry. Shh. It isn\\'t your fault. It wasn\\'t fair for me to suddenly ask so much of you. But things are different now. And doubt is a luxury we can\\'t afford anymore, sweetie. You have more power than you realize. Don\\'t think. And don\\'t worry. If the time comes, you\\'ll know what to do. It\\'s in your blood. He\\'s not weak, you know. What? Valuing life is not weakness. Hey. Look, if you\\'re talking about what happened in the containment unit, I had everything under control. And disregarding it is not strength. I called his bluff, sweetheart, that\\'s all. I knew he wouldn\\'t have it in him to actually... Next time you gamble, bet your own life! Okay, okay, okay. A rocket? Hey! Well, not that this isn\\'t fun, but I\\'m gonna go look around. What do you think is going on here? You think we\\'re on vacation? Mom and Dad\\'s lives could be in jeopardy. Or worse, their marriage. Their marriage? So, the bad guys are trying to wreck Mom and Dad\\'s marriage. Forget it. You\\'re so immature. - I\\'m gonna go look around. - Mom said to stay hidden. I\\'m not gonna leave the cave. Sheesh. Cool! Cool! Roger. We are ready for launch. - Vi, Vi! - What did you do? ETA two-niner. Over. TCI clear. Condition yellow. Status norm. Not responding to IFF. IRCM reads negative. - Bob. - What? I didn\\'t say anything. Identification, please. - Hey! Hey, Violet! Come here, look. - What? - It talks! - What? There. That one. Voice key incorrect. - \"Voice key\"? - Voice key incorrect. Wait a second. - What do we do? - Run! - Where are we going? - Away from here! Intruder alert. - There isn\\'t much time. - No, there isn\\'t. In fact, there\\'s no time at all. - Please... - Why are you here? How can you possibly bring me lower? What more can you take away from me? Family survived the crash. - They\\'re here on the island! - They\\'re alive? - Helen? - Hello. You must be Mrs... - She was helping me to escape. - No. That\\'s what I was doing. Let go of me! Let go, you lousy, lying, unfaithful creep! How could I betray the perfect woman? - Oh, you\\'re referring to me now? - Where are the kids? - They triggered the alert. - What? - Security\\'s in the jungle. Get going. - Our kids are in danger? If you suspected danger, why\\'d you bring them? They stowed away. You\\'re not striking the proper tone. - Think they\\'re supers? - Dash, remember what Mom said. - What? - Stop talking! - Hold it! Freeze! - Dash, run! - What? - Run! - They\\'re supers! - Get the boy! Show yourself! Hey! Ha, ha! I\\'m alive. Yeah! I should\\'ve told you I was fired, I admit it. But I didn\\'t want you to worry. You didn\\'t want me to worry? We\\'re running for our lives through some godforsaken jungle. You keep trying to pick a fight, but I\\'m just happy you\\'re alive. I know you\\'re there, Little Miss Disappear. You can\\'t hide from me. - There you are. - Hey! Don\\'t touch my sister! - How are you doing that? - I don\\'t know! Whatever you do, don\\'t stop! Mom! Dad! Hey! Kids. - You\\'re all right. - You\\'re all right. - We were so worried. - I thought I\\'d never see you again. I love you. - Wow. - Whoa. Time out! What have we here? Matching uniforms? Oh, no! Elastigirl? You married Elastigirl? Whoa! And got busy! It\\'s a whole family of supers. Looks like I\\'ve hit the jackpot! Oh, this is just too good! - The ship\\'s unique design... - There were no fatalities... Huh? Huh? Oh, come on! You gotta admit, this is cool. Just like a movie! The robot will emerge dramatically, do some damage. Throngs of screaming people! And just when all hope is lost, Syndrome will save the day! I\\'ll be a bigger hero than you ever were! You mean you killed off real heroes so that you could pretend to be one? Oh, I\\'m real. Real enough to defeat you! And I did it without your precious gifts, your oh-so-special powers. I\\'ll give them heroics. I\\'ll give them the most spectacular heroics anyone\\'s ever seen! And when I\\'m old and I\\'ve had my fun, I\\'ll sell my inventions so that everyone can be superheroes. Everyone can be super. And when everyone\\'s super... ...no one will be. Fire at will! It\\'s overwhelming the tanks. I\\'m sorry. This is my fault. I\\'ve been a lousy father. Blind to what I have. So obsessed with being undervalued - That I undervalued all of you. - Dad? Shh. Don\\'t interrupt. So caught up in the past that I... You are my greatest adventure. And I almost missed it. I swear, I\\'m gonna get us out of this safely if I... Well, I think Dad has made some excellent progress today but I think it\\'s time we wind down now. We need to get back to the mainland. I saw an aircraft hangar on my way in. Straight ahead. Where are all the guards? Go, go! Hey, every time they run, you take a shot. This is the right hangar, but I don\\'t see any jets. - A jet\\'s not fast enough. - What\\'s faster than a jet? How about a rocket? - Great! I can\\'t fly a rocket. - You don\\'t have to. Use the coordinates from the last launch. Wait. I bet Syndrome\\'s changed the password by now. - How do I get into the computer? - Say please. - Honey? - What? - Where is my supersuit? - What? Where is my supersuit? - I put it away. - Where? Why do you need to know? I need it! Don\\'t you think about running off doing no derrin\\'-do. We\\'ve been planning this dinner for two months! - The public is in danger! - My evening\\'s in danger! Tell me where my suit is, woman! We are talking about the greater good. \"Greater good\"? I am your wife! I\\'m the greatest good you are ever gonna get! Run! My baby! - The supers have returned! - Is that Fironic? - Fironic? - No, Fironic has a different outfit. No, no, I\\'m a new superhero! I\\'m Syndrome! All right, stand back. Someone needs to teach this hunk of metal a few manners. Ha, ha! - Are we there yet? - We get there when we get there. How you doing, honey? Do I have to answer? Kids, strap yourselves down like I told you. Here we go, honey. Ready, Violet? Ready? Now! This is gonna be rough. Robot\\'s in the financial district. Which exit? - Traction Avenue. - That\\'ll take me downtown. - I take Seventh, don\\'t I? - Don\\'t take Seventh! - Great, we missed it. - Ask how to get there, I told you. - Traction. - That\\'ll take me downtown. Get in the right lane! Signal! - Not Traction! - You\\'re gonna miss it! Is everybody okay back there? - Super-duper, Dad! - Let\\'s do that again. Wait here and stay hidden. I\\'m going in. While what? I watch helplessly from the sidelines? - I don\\'t think so. - I\\'m asking you to wait with the kids. And I\\'m telling you not a chance. You\\'re my husband. I\\'m with you for better or worse. I have to do this alone. - What is this to you? Playtime? - No. - So you can be Mr. Incredible again? - No! - Then what? - I\\'m not... - Not what? - I\\'m not strong enough. - This will make you stronger? - Yes. No! That\\'s what this is? Some sort of workout? I can\\'t lose you again! I can\\'t. Not again. I\\'m not... strong enough. If we work together, you won\\'t have to be. I don\\'t know what\\'ll happen. We\\'re superheroes. What can happen? Vi! Dash! No! Violet? - Dad! - Go, go! - I\\'m okay, Mom. Really. - Stay here, okay? Frozone! Yeah! Bob! Hey! Syndrome\\'s remote! The remote controls the robot! - Throw it, throw it! - Go long! Got it! Honey, take out its guns! Gotcha! Mom, I\\'ve got it! I\\'ve got the remote! A remote? A remote that controls what? The robot? It\\'s coming back! - That wasn\\'t right. - Give me that! We can\\'t stop it. The only thing hard enough to penetrate it is... ...itself. It\\'s getting closer! - It doesn\\'t work! - Kids! It\\'s not doing anything. - Try to buy us some time. - Try the one next to it. Honey! Wait a minute. Press that button again! - No, the other one! The first one! - First button! Got it! - It\\'s getting closer! - Look out! - Get out of here! - We\\'re not going anywhere. - Press the button! - Not yet! - Hang on! - What are you waiting for? A closer target! You got one shot! Everybody duck! Hey, Zone. Huh? No! Did you see that? That\\'s the way to do it. - That\\'s old school. - Yeah. No school like the old school. - Just like old times. Oh! - Just like old times. Yeah. Hurt then too. We\\'ve frozen all of Syndrome\\'s assets. If he even sneezes, we\\'ll be there with a hanky and a pair of handcuffs. The people of this country are indebted to you. Does this mean we can come out of hiding? Let the politicians figure that one out. I\\'ve been asked to assure you we\\'ll take care of everything else. You did good, Bob. Hi, this is Kari. I have a question about Jack-Jack... Come on. We\\'re in a limo. Hey, you\\'re wearing your hair back? - Yeah, I just... yeah. - It looks good. - Thanks, Dad. - That was cool when you threw that car! Not as cool as you running on water. That was sweet when you snagged that bad guy with your arm and whiplashed him into the other guy. Sweet! - I\\'m trying to listen to messages. - It\\'s me. Jack-Jack is fine, but weird things are happening. Jack-Jack\\'s still fine, but I\\'m getting really weirded out! When are you coming back? ...aced those guys that tried to kill us! That was the best vacation ever! I love our family. I\\'m not fine, Mrs. Parr! Put that down! Stop it! You need to call me. I need help, Mrs... Bob, listen to this. I\\'m gonna call the police... Hi, this is Kari. Sorry for freaking out, but your baby has special needs. Thanks for sending a replacement. I didn\\'t call a replacement. Shh. The baby is sleeping. You took away my future. I\\'m simply returning the favor. Don\\'t worry, I\\'ll be a good mentor. Supportive, encouraging. Everything you weren\\'t. And in time, who knows, he might make a good sidekick. He\\'s getting away, Bob! We have to do something now. What\\'s happening? - Stop him! Throw something! - I might hit Jack-Jack. Throw me. Bob, throw me! No! This isn\\'t the end of it! I will get your son, eventually. I\\'ll get your son! Oh, no. Look at Mommy, honey. Don\\'t look down. Mommy\\'s got you. Everything is all right. That\\'s my girl. Does this mean we have to move again? Oh, man. That was totally wicked! Do we have to have cheerleaders at the track meet? - What is that all about? - I always thought it was more... - Hey. - Hey. - You\\'re, uh, Violet, right? - That\\'s me. - See you, Vi. - You look different. I feel different. Is different okay? Hey, different is... Different is great. Would you... - Yeah? - Do you think maybe... ...you and I... - Yeah? - Do you... - Shh. I like movies. I\\'ll buy the popcorn. Okay? A movie. There you go. Yeah. - Wait, so Friday? - Friday. - Go, Dash, go. - Run! Come on, run! Pick up the pace. Run! Move it, move it! Pace it. Slow down just a little bit. - Make it close! - Second. Close second, yeah! That\\'s my boy! Dash, I\\'m so proud of you. I didn\\'t know what the heck you wanted me to do. Behold the Underminer! I am always beneath you, but nothing is beneath me! I hereby declare war on peace and happiness! Soon all will tremble before me!'\n",

      " '[CHILDREN LAUGHING] [PHILLIPA SCREAMS] [SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] ATTENDANT [IN JAPANESE]: Are you here to kill me? I know what this is. I\\'ve seen one before. Many, many years ago. It belonged to a man I met in a half-remembered dream. A man possessed of some radical notions. COBB: What is the most resilient parasite? A bacteria? A virus? An intestinal worm? ARTHUR: Uh.... What Mr. Cobb is trying to say-- An idea. Resilient. Highly contagious. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain, it\\'s almost impossible to eradicate. An idea that is fully formed, fully understood, that sticks. Right in there somewhere. For someone like you to steal? Yes. In the dream state, your conscious defenses are lowered... ...and that makes your thoughts vulnerable to theft. It\\'s called extraction. Mr. Saito, we can train your subconscious to defend itself... ...from even the most skilled extractor. How can you do that? Because I am the most skilled extractor. I know how to search your mind and find your secrets. I know the tricks. And I can teach them to you, so that even when you\\'re asleep... ...your defense is never down. Look, if you want my help, you\\'re gonna have to be completely open with me. I need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife... ...better than your therapist, better than anyone. If this is a dream, and you have a safe full of secrets... ...I need to know what\\'s in that safe. In order for this all to work, you need to completely let me in. Enjoy your evening, gentlemen, as I consider your proposal. He knows. [RUMBLING] What\\'s going on up there? [MEN SHOUTING] [MACHINE HISSING] [EXPLOSION] [RUMBLING] Saito knows. He\\'s playing with us. Doesn\\'t matter. I can get it here. Trust me. The information is in the safe. He looked right at it when I mentioned secrets. What\\'s she doing here? Just head back to the room. All right? I\\'ll take care of this. Okay, make sure you do. We\\'re here to work. If I jumped, would I survive? With a clean dive, perhaps. Mal, what are you doing here? I thought you might be missing me. COBB: You know that I am. But I can\\'t trust you anymore. So what? MAL: Looks like Arthur\\'s taste. Actually, the subject is partial to postwar British painters. Please, have a seat. MAL: Tell me... ...do the children miss me? You can\\'t imagine. What are you doing? Just getting some fresh air. Stay where you are, Mal. [GRUNTS] Goddamn it. [SOFT SCREECHING] [SILENCED GUNSHOT] [GUARD GRUNTS] [SILENCED GUNSHOT THEN GUARD GRUNTS] SAITO: Turn around. The gun, Dom. Please. Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb. Did she tell you? Or have you known all along? That you\\'re here to steal from me, or that we are actually asleep? I want to know the name of your employer. Ah, there\\'s no use threatening him in a dream, right, Mal? That depends on what you\\'re threatening. Killing him would just wake him up. But pain.... [SCREAMS] Pain is in the mind. And judging by the decor, we\\'re in your mind, aren\\'t we, Arthur? [GRUNTS] - What are you doing? It\\'s too soon. - But the dream\\'s collapsing. I\\'m gonna try to keep Saito under a little bit longer. We\\'re almost there. [SILENCED GUNFIRE] He was close. Very close. [SCREAMS] [YELLS] Stop him! [GUNFIRE] [GRUNTS] [HISSING] [SAITO GROANS] This isn\\'t gonna work. Wake him up. [GRUNTS] He won\\'t wake. - Give him the kick. NASH: What? Dunk him. [GUN COCKS] [WOOD GROANING] [SAITO GRUNTING] COBB: He\\'s out. [SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] You came prepared, hmm? Not even my head of security knows this apartment. How did you find it? It\\'s difficult for a man of your position to keep a love nest like this secret... ...particularly where there\\'s a married woman involved. - She would never.... - Yet here we are. - With a dilemma. - They\\'re getting closer. - You got what you came for. COBB: Well, that\\'s not true. You left out a key piece of information, didn\\'t you? You held something back because you knew what we were up to. - Question is, why\\'d you let us in at all? - An audition. - An audition for what? - Doesn\\'t matter. You failed. We extracted every bit of information you had in there. But your deception was obvious. [MACHINE HISSING] [EDITH PIAF\\'S \"NON, JE NE REGRETTE RIEN\" PLAYING] [SONG ECHOING] - So leave me and go. - You don\\'t seem to understand, Mr. Saito. That corporation that hired us, they won\\'t accept failure. We won\\'t last two days. Cobb? Looks like I\\'m gonna have to do this a little more simply. Tell us what you know! Tell us what you know, now! [LAUGHING] SAITO: I\\'ve always hated this carpet. It\\'s stained and frayed in such distinctive ways. But very definitely made of wool. Right now... ...I\\'m lying on polyester. Which means I\\'m not lying on my carpet, in my apartment. You have lived up to your reputation, Mr. Cobb. I\\'m still dreaming. [ALARM BEEPING] - How\\'d it go? - Not good. Dream within a dream, huh? I\\'m impressed. But in my dream, you play by my rules. Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito.... We\\'re not in your dream. We\\'re in mine. [MEN SHOUTING] [ALARM BEEPING FASTER] [NASH YELLS] Asshole. How do you mess up the carpet? - It wasn\\'t my fault. - You\\'re the architect. I didn\\'t know he was gonna rub his cheek on it! That\\'s enough. You. What the hell was all that? - I have it under control. - I\\'d hate to see you out of control. We don\\'t have time for this. I\\'m getting off at Kyoto. ARTHUR: He\\'s not gonna check every compartment. Yeah, well, I don\\'t like trains. Listen. Every man for himself. [PHONE RINGS] Yes, hello? PHILLIPA: Hi, Daddy. JAMES: Hi, Dad. Hey, guys. Hey. How are you? How you doing, huh? PHILLIPA: Good. JAMES: Okay, I guess. Okay? Who\\'s just okay? Is that you, James? JAMES: Yeah. When are you coming home, Dad? Well, I can\\'t, sweetheart. I can\\'t. Not for a while, remember? JAMES: Why? Look, I told you, I\\'m away because I\\'m working, right? PHILLIPA: Grandma says you\\'re never coming back. COBB: Phillipa, is that you? Put Grandma on the phone for me, will you? PHILLIPA: She\\'s shaking her head. Well, just hope she\\'s wrong about that. JAMES: Daddy? Yeah, James? JAMES: Is Mommy with you? James, we talked about this. Mommy\\'s not here anymore. JAMES: Where? WOMAN: That\\'s enough, kids. Say bye-bye. Listen, I\\'m gonna send some presents with Grandpa, all right? And you be good, you be-- [DIAL TONE] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - Our ride\\'s on the roof. - Right. Hey, are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I\\'m fine. Why? Well, down in the dream, Mal showing up. Look, I\\'m, uh, sorry about your leg. Won\\'t happen again. - It\\'s getting worse, isn\\'t it? - One apology\\'s all you\\'re getting, all right? - Where\\'s Nash? - He hasn\\'t shown. You wanna wait? We were supposed to deliver Saito\\'s expansion plans... ...to Cobol Engineering two hours ago. By now, they know we failed. It\\'s time we disappear. - Where you gonna go? - Buenos Aires. I can lie low there, maybe sniff out a job when things quiet down. You? Stateside. Send my regards. He sold you out. Thought to come to me and bargain for his life. So I offer you the satisfaction. It\\'s not the way I deal with things. [HELICOPTER STARTING] - What will you do with him? - Nothing. But I can\\'t speak for Cobol Engineering. - What do you want from us? - Inception. - Is it possible? - Of course not. If you can steal an idea from someone\\'s mind... ...why can\\'t you plant one there instead? Okay, here\\'s me planting an idea in your head. I say, \"Don\\'t think about elephants.\" What are you thinking about? Elephants. Right. But it\\'s not your idea, because you know I gave it to you. The subject\\'s mind can always trace the genesis of the idea. - True inspiration\\'s impossible to fake. - That\\'s not true. - Can you do it? - Are you offering me a choice? Because I can find my own way to square things with Cobol. Then you do have a choice. Then I choose to leave, sir. Tell the crew where you want to go. Hey, Mr. Cobb. How would you like to go home? To America. To your children. You can\\'t fix that. No one can. - Just like inception. - Cobb, come on. - How complex is the idea? - Simple enough. No idea is simple when you need to plant it in somebody else\\'s mind. My main competitor is an old man in poor health. His son will soon inherit control of the corporation. I need him to decide to break up his father\\'s empire. - Cobb, we should walk away from this. - Hold on. If I were to do this, if I even could do it... ...I\\'d need a guarantee. - How do I know you can deliver? - You don\\'t. But I can. So do you want to take a leap of faith... ...or become an old man, filled with regret... ...waiting to die alone? Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb. And choose your people more wisely. Look, I know how much you wanna go home. This can\\'t be done. Yes, it can. Just have to go deep enough. You don\\'t know that. I\\'ve done it before. Who\\'d you do it to? Why are we going to Paris? We\\'re gonna need a new architect. [BELLS TOLLING] COBB: You never did like your office, did you? No space to think in that broom cupboard. Is it safe for you to be here? Extradition between France and the United States... ...is a bureaucratic nightmare, you know that. I think they might find a way to make it work in your case. Look, l, uh, brought these for you to give to the kids when you have a chance. It\\'ll take more than the occasional stuffed animal... ...to convince those children they still have a father. I\\'m just doing what I know. I\\'m doing what you taught me. I never taught you to be a thief. No, you taught me to navigate people\\'s minds. But after what happened... ...there weren\\'t a whole lot of legitimate ways for me to use that skill. What are you doing here, Dom? I think I found a way home. It\\'s a job for some very, very powerful people. People who I believe can fix my charges permanently. But I need your help. You\\'re here to corrupt one of my brightest and best. You know what I\\'m offering. Let them decide for themselves. - Money. - Not just money. You remember. It\\'s the chance to build cathedrals, entire cities... ...things that never existed... ...things that couldn\\'t exist in the real world. So you want me to let someone else follow you into your fantasy? They don\\'t actually come into the dream. They just design the levels and teach them to the dreamers. That\\'s all. Design it yourself. Mal won\\'t let me. Come back to reality, Dom. - Please. - Reality. Those kids, your grandchildren... ...they\\'re waiting for their father to come back home. That\\'s their reality. And this job, this last job, that\\'s how I get there. I would not be standing here if I knew any other way. I need an architect who\\'s as good as I was. I\\'ve got somebody better. Ariadne? I\\'d like you to meet Mr. Cobb. Pleased to meet you. If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has a job offer he\\'d like to discuss with you. A work placement? Not exactly. I have a test for you. You\\'re not gonna tell me anything first? Before I describe the job, I have to know you can do it. - Why? - It\\'s not, strictly speaking, legal. You have two minutes to design a maze that it takes one minute to solve. Stop. Again. Stop. You\\'re gonna have to do better than that. That\\'s more like it. COBB: They say we only use a fraction of our brain\\'s true potential. Now, that\\'s when we\\'re awake. When we\\'re asleep, our mind can do almost anything. Such as? Imagine you\\'re designing a building. You consciously create each aspect. But sometimes, it feels like it\\'s almost creating itself, if you know what I mean. Yeah, like I\\'m discovering it. Genuine inspiration, right? Now, in a dream, our mind continuously does this. We create and perceive our world simultaneously. And our mind does this so well that we don\\'t even know it\\'s happening. That allows us to get right in the middle of that process. - How? - By taking over the creating part. Now, this is where I need you. You create the world of the dream. We bring the subject into that dream, and they fill it with their subconscious. How could I ever acquire enough detail to make them think that it\\'s reality? Well, dreams, they feel real while we\\'re in them, right? It\\'s only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange. Let me ask you a question. You never really remember the beginning of a dream, do you? You always wind up right in the middle of what\\'s going on. I guess, yeah. So how did we end up here? Well, we just came from the, uh.... Think about it, Ariadne. How did you get here? Where are you right now? We\\'re dreaming? You\\'re in the middle of the workshop, sleeping. This is your first lesson in shared dreaming. Stay calm. [CUP RATTLING] [RUMBLING] If it\\'s just a dream, then why are you--? [\"NON, JE NE REGRETTE RlEN\" PLAYING] COBB: Because it\\'s never just a dream, is it? And a face full of glass hurts like hell. When you\\'re in it, it feels real. ARTHUR: That\\'s why the military developed dream sharing. It was a training program for soldiers to shoot, stab and strangle each other... ...and then wake up. ARIADNE: How did architects become involved? COBB: Well, someone had to design the dreams, right? Why don\\'t you give us another five minutes? Five minutes? [MUSIC STOPS] What--? We were talking for, like, at least an hour. In a dream, your mind functions more quickly... ...therefore time seems to feel more slow. Five minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream. Why don\\'t you see what you can get up to in five minutes? [MACHINE HISSING] COBB: You\\'ve got the basic layout. Bookstore, cafe. Almost everything else is here too. ARIADNE: Who are the people? - Projections of my subconscious. - Yours? - Yes. Remember, you are the dreamer. You build this world. I am the subject. My mind populates it. You can literally talk to my subconscious. That\\'s one of the ways we extract information from the subject. How else do you do it? By creating something secure, like a bank vault or a jail. The mind automatically fills it with information it\\'s trying to protect. - You understand? - Then you break in and steal it? Well.... I guess I thought that the dream space would be all about the visual... ...but it\\'s more about the feel of it. My question is what happens when you start messing with the physics of it all? [RUMBLING THEN METAL GROANING] It\\'s something, isn\\'t it? Yes, it is. ARIADNE: Why are they all looking at me? Because my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world. The more you change things, the quicker the projections start to converge on you. Converge? They sense the foreign nature of the dreamer. They attack, like white blood cells fighting an infection. - What, they\\'re gonna attack us? - No, no. Just you. [METAL CREAKING] This is great, but I\\'m telling you, if you keep changing things like this.... Jeez, mind telling your subconscious to take it easy? It\\'s my subconscious. Remember? I can\\'t control it. Very impressive. I know this bridge. This place is real, isn\\'t it? Yeah, I cross it every day to get to the college. Never re-create places from your memory. Always imagine new places. You draw from stuff you know, right? Only use details. A streetlamp or a phone booth. Never entire areas. - Why not? - Building a dream from your memory... ...is the easiest way to lose your grasp on what\\'s real and what is a dream. - Is that what happened to you? - Listen to me. This has nothing to do with me, understand? That why you need me to build your dreams? Hey, get off of her. Back up. Back up. - Cobb! Cobb! - Get off of her! - Let me go! Let me go! - Mal! - Mal! - Cobb! Wake me up! - Wake me up! Wake me up! - No! - Mal, no! No! - Wake me up! [GASPING] Hey, hey, hey. Look at me. You\\'re okay. You\\'re okay. - Hey. - Why wouldn\\'t I wake up? There was still time on the clock. You can\\'t wake up from within the dream unless you die. - She\\'ll need a totem. ARIADNE: What? A totem, it\\'s a small personal-- That\\'s some subconscious you\\'ve got on you, Cobb! - She\\'s a real charmer. - Oh. - I see you met Mrs. Cobb. - She\\'s his wife? Yeah. So a totem. You need a small object, potentially heavy. Something you can have on you that no one else knows. ARIADNE: Like a coin? ARTHUR: No. It needs to be more unique than that. Like, this is a loaded die. No, I can\\'t let you touch it. That would defeat the purpose. See, only I know the balance and the weight of this particular loaded die. That way, when you look at your totem... ...you know beyond a doubt that you\\'re not in someone else\\'s dream. I don\\'t know if you can\\'t see what\\'s going on, or if you just don\\'t want to... ...but Cobb has some serious problems that he\\'s tried to bury down there. And I\\'m not about to just open my mind to someone like that. [DOOR CLOSES] She\\'ll be back. I\\'ve never seen anyone pick it up that quickly before. Reality\\'s not gonna be enough for her now, and when she comes back.... When she comes back, you\\'re gonna have her building mazes. - Where are you gonna be? - I gotta go visit Eames. Eames? No, he\\'s in Mombasa. It\\'s Cobol\\'s back yard. It\\'s a necessary risk. - Well, there\\'s plenty of good thieves. - We don\\'t just need a thief. We need a forger. Rub them together all you want, they\\'re not gonna breed. You never know. COBB: I\\'m gonna get you a drink. You\\'re buying. - Your spelling hasn\\'t improved. - Piss off. How\\'s your handwriting? - It\\'s versatile. - Good. Thank you very much. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it\\'s impossible, let me-- No, it\\'s perfectly possible. It\\'s just bloody difficult. Interesting. Because Arthur keeps telling me it can\\'t be done. Hmm. Arthur. You still working with that stick in the mud? He is good at what he does, right? Oh, he\\'s the best, but he has no imagination. Not like you. Listen, if you\\'re gonna perform inception, you need imagination. Let me ask you something. Have you done it before? We tried it. Uh, we got the idea in place, but it didn\\'t take. - You didn\\'t plant it deep enough? - No, it\\'s not just about depth. You need the simplest version of the idea... ...in order for it to grow naturally in your subject\\'s mind. It\\'s a subtle art. So, what is this idea that you need to plant? We need the heir of a major corporation to dissolve his father\\'s empire. Right there you have various political motivations... ...and anti-monopolistic sentiments and so forth. But all of that stuff, it\\'s, um.... It\\'s really at the mercy of your subject\\'s prejudice, you see? What you have to do is start at the absolute basic. Which is what? The relationship with the father. - Do you have a chemist? - No, not yet. Right. Okay, well, there\\'s a man here, Yusuf. He, uh, formulates his own versions of the compounds. Why don\\'t you take me there? Once you\\'ve lost your tail. The man at the bar. COBB: Cobol Engineering. That price on my head, was that dead or alive? Don\\'t remember. Let\\'s see if he starts shooting. Run interference. I\\'ll meet you downstairs in the bar in, say, uh, half an hour? - Back here? - This is the last place they\\'d suspect. [CHUCKLES] All right. Freddy. Freddy Simmonds. My God, it\\'s you, isn\\'t it? [GRUNTS] No, it isn\\'t you. Not dreaming now, are you? [GRUNTS THEN PEOPLE SHOUTING] MAN: Get him! There! [WAITER SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] One cafe. Shh. [WAITER SHOUTING] One cafe. One cafe. [MEN SHOUTING] [HORN HONKS] [GRUNTING] [TIRES SCREECH] Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb? - What are you doing in Mombasa? - I\\'m here to protect my investment. [WHISTLE] Ah. So this is your idea of losing a tail, huh? Different tail. [ARIADNE CLEARS THROAT] Cobb said you\\'d be back. - I tried not to come, but.... - But there\\'s nothing quite like it. It\\'s just... ...pure creation. Shall we take a look at some paradoxical architecture? ARTHUR: You\\'re gonna have to master a few tricks... ...if you\\'re gonna build three complete dream levels. Excuse me. ARIADNE: What kind of tricks? In a dream, you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes. That lets you create closed loops, like the Penrose Steps. The infinite staircase. See? Paradox. So a closed loop like that... ...will help you disguise the boundaries of the dream you create. But how big do these levels have to be? It could be anything from the floor of a building to an entire city. They have to be complicated enough that we can hide from the projections. - A maze? - Right, a maze. And the better the maze.... Then the longer we have before the projections catch us? Exactly. - My subconscious seems polite enough. - Ha, ha. You wait, they\\'ll turn ugly. No one likes to feel someone else messing around in their mind. Cobb can\\'t build anymore, can he? I don\\'t know if he can\\'t, but he won\\'t. He thinks it\\'s safer if he doesn\\'t know the layouts. Why? He won\\'t tell me. But I think it\\'s Mal. - His ex-wife? - No, not his ex. - They\\'re still together? - No. No, she\\'s dead. What you see in there is just his projection of her. What was she like in real life? She was lovely. YUSUF: You are seeking a chemist? COBB: Yes. To formulate compounds for a job? And to go into the field with us. No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb. Well, we\\'d need you there to tailor compounds specific to our needs. - Which are? - Great depth. A dream within a dream? Two levels? Three. Not possible. That many dreams within dreams is too unstable. It is possible. You just have to add a sedative. A powerful sedative. - How many team members? - Five. SAITO: Six. The only way to know you\\'ve done the job is if I go in with you. There\\'s no room for tourists on a job like this, Mr. Saito. This time, it seems there is. This, I think, is a good place to start. I use it every day. COBB: What for? - Here, I\\'ll show you. Perhaps you will not want to see. After you. [MACHINE HISSING] EAMES: Ten. Twelve. All connected. Bloody hell. They come every day to share the dream. You see? Very stable. - How long do they dream for? YUSUF: Three, four hours, each day. In dream time? With this compound? About 40 hours, each and every day. - Why do they do it? YUSUF: Tell him, Mr. Cobb. After a while, it becomes the only way you can dream. Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb? - They come here every day to sleep? MAN: No. They come to be woken up. The dream has become their reality. Who are you to say otherwise, sir? Let\\'s see what you can do. [METAL GROANING] You know how to find me. You know what you have to do. Sharp, no? SAITO: Are you all right, Mr. Cobb? Yeah, yeah. Everything\\'s just fine. Robert Fischer, heir to the Fischer Morrow energy conglomerate. COBB: What\\'s your problem with this Mr. Fischer? That\\'s not your concern. Mr. Saito, this isn\\'t your typical corporate espionage. You asked me for inception. I do hope you understand the gravity of that request. Now, the seed that we plant in this man\\'s mind will grow into an idea. This idea will define him. It may come to change.... Well, it may come to change everything about him. We\\'re the last company standing between them and total energy dominance. And we can no longer compete. Soon, they\\'ll control the energy supply of half the world. In effect, they become a new superpower. The world needs Robert Fischer to change his mind. EAMES: That\\'s where we come in. How is Robert Fischer\\'s relationship with his father? Rumor is the relationship is quite complicated. Well, we can\\'t work based solely on rumor, can we? Can you get me access to this man here? Browning. Fischer Senior\\'s right-hand man. Fischer Junior\\'s godfather. It should be possible, if you can get the right references. References are something of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito. BROWNING: I\\'m not smelling settlement here. Take them down. LAWYER: Mr. Browning... ...Maurice Fischer\\'s policy is always one of avoiding litigation. Well, shall we voice your concerns with Maurice directly? Not sure that\\'s necessary. No, no, no. I think we should. BROWNING: How is he? I don\\'t want to bother him unnecessarily, but-- MAURICE: Robert, I told you keep out the damn-- Wait. So do it. Get-- NURSE: Mr. Fischer. MAURICE: Put it through. Never, never. Never do the same as I asked. Leave that. Here. BROWNING: Must be a cherished memory of his. I put it beside his bed. He hasn\\'t even noticed. Robert... ...we need to talk about a power of attorney. - I know this is hard, but it\\'s imperative-- - Not now, Uncle Peter. EAMES: The vultures are circling. And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the more powerful Peter Browning becomes. I\\'ve had ample opportunity to observe Browning... ...and adopt his physical presence, study his mannerisms, and so on and so forth. So now in the first layer of the dream, I can impersonate Browning. And suggest concepts to Fischer\\'s conscious mind. Then, when we take him a level deeper... ...his own projection of Browning should feed that right back to him. So he gives himself the idea. Precisely. That\\'s the only way it will stick. It has to seem self-generated. Eames, I am impressed. Your condescension, as always, is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you. [DOOR OPENS] Were you going under on your own? No, no, I was just, uh, running some experiments. I didn\\'t realize anyone was here, so.... Yeah, I was just-- I was working on my totem, actually. Here, let me take a look. So you\\'re learning, huh? An elegant solution for keeping track of reality. - Was it your idea? - No, it was, uh.... It was Mal\\'s, actually. This.... This one was hers. She would spin it in the dream and it would never topple. Just spin and spin. Arthur told me she passed away. How are the mazes coming along? Each level relates to the part of the subject\\'s subconscious... ...that we are trying to access. So I\\'m making the bottom level a hospital, so Fischer will bring his father. You know, l-- Actually, I have a question about this layout. No, no, no. Don\\'t show me specifics. Only the dreamer should know the layout. Why is that so important? In case one of us brings in our projections. We don\\'t want them knowing the details of the maze. You mean in case you bring Mal in. You can\\'t keep her out, can you? - Right. - You can\\'t build... ...because if you know the maze, then she knows it. Well, she\\'d sabotage the whole operation. - Cobb, do the others know? - No. No, they don\\'t. You\\'ve gotta warn them if this is getting worse. No one said it\\'s getting worse. I need to get home. That\\'s all I care about right now. Why can\\'t you go home? Because they think I killed her. - Thank you. - For what? For not asking whether I did. \"I will split up my father\\'s empire.\" Now, this is obviously an idea that Robert himself would choose to reject... ...which is why we need to plant it deep in his subconscious. The subconscious is motivated by emotion, right? Not reason. We need to find a way to translate this into an emotional concept. How do you translate business strategy into emotion? That\\'s what we\\'re here to figure out. Robert\\'s relationship with his father... - ...is stressed, to say the least. - Can we run with that? We suggest breaking up his father\\'s company as a \"screw you\" to the old man. No, because I think positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time. We all yearn for reconciliation, for catharsis. We need Robert Fischer to have a positive emotional reaction to all this. All right, well, try this. Um.... \"My father accepts that I want to create for myself, not follow in his footsteps.\" That might work. Might? We\\'re gonna need to do a little better than \"might.\" Thank you for your contribution, Arthur. Forgive me for wanting a little specificity, Eames. Specificity? Inception\\'s not about being specific. When we get inside his mind, we\\'re gonna have to work with what we find. EAMES: On the top level, we open up his relationship with his father... ...and say, \"I will not follow in my father\\'s footsteps.\" Then the next level down, we feed him, \"I will create something for myself.\" Then, by the time we hit the bottom level, we bring out the big guns. - \"My father doesn\\'t want me to be him.\" EAMES: Exactly. [MACHINE HISSING] Three layers down, the dreams are gonna collapse with the slightest disturbance. Sedation. For sleep stable enough to create three layers of dreaming... ...we\\'ll have to combine it with an extremely powerful sedative. [MACHINE HISSING] Good night. YUSUF: The compound we\\'ll be using to share the dream... ...creates a clear connection between dreamers... - ...whilst accelerating brain function. - In other words, more time on each level. Brain function in the dream will be about 20 times normal. And when you enter a dream within that dream, the effect is compounded. It\\'s three dreams, that\\'s 10 hours times 20-- Math was never my strong subject. How much time is that? It\\'s a week, the first level down. Six months the second level down, and the third level-- That\\'s 10 years. Who\\'d wanna be stuck in a dream for 10 years? Depends on the dream. So once we\\'ve made the plant, how do we get out? I\\'m hoping you have something more elegant than shooting me in the head. - A kick. - What\\'s a kick? EAMES: This, Ariadne, would be a kick. It\\'s that feeling of falling you get that jolts you awake. - Snaps you out of the dream. - We gonna feel a kick with this sedation? YUSUF: That\\'s the clever part. I customized the sedative to leave inner-ear function unimpaired. That way, however deep the sleep, the sleeper still feels falling. Or tipping. The trick is to synchronize a kick that can penetrate all three levels. We could use a musical countdown to synchronize the different kicks. [\"NON, JE NE REGRETTE RIEN\" PLAYING] EAMES: He hasn\\'t got any surgery scheduled, no dental, nothing. COBB: Wasn\\'t he supposed to have a knee operation? Nothing. Nothing that they\\'ll put him under for, anyway. And we need-- We need at least a good 10 hours. Sydney to Los Angeles. One of the longest flights in the world. He makes it every two weeks. He must be flying private, then. SAITO: Not if there were unexpected maintenance with his plane. ARTHUR: It would have to be a 747. - Why\\'s that? On a 747, the pilot\\'s up top... ...the first-class cabin\\'s in the nose, so no one would walk through. You\\'d have to buy out the entire cabin and the first-class flight attendant. I bought the airline. It seemed neater. Well, looks like we have our 10 hours. Ariadne? Terrific work, by the way. [MACHINE HISSING] MAL: You know how to find me. You know what you have to do. You remember when you asked me to marry you? Of course I do. You said you had a dream. That we\\'d grow old together. And we can. COBB: You shouldn\\'t be here. Just wanted to see what kind of tests you\\'re doing on your own every night. - This has nothing to do with you. - This has everything to do with me. - You\\'ve asked me to share dreams with you. - Not these. These are my dreams. ARIADNE: Why do you do this to yourself? It\\'s the only way I can still dream. Why is it so important to dream? In my dreams, we\\'re still together. These aren\\'t just dreams. These are memories. And you said never to use memories. I know I did. You\\'re trying to keep her alive. You can\\'t let her go. You don\\'t understand. These are moments I regret. They\\'re memories that I have to change. Well, what\\'s down there that you regret? Listen, there\\'s only one thing you need to understand about me. ARIADNE: This is your house? Mine and Mal\\'s, yes. Where is she? She\\'s already gone. That\\'s my son, James. He\\'s digging for something, maybe a worm. [JAMES GIGGLING] That\\'s Phillipa. I thought about calling out to them... ...so they\\'d turn and smile and I could see... ...those beautiful faces of theirs, but it\\'s all too late. MAN: Right now or never, Cobb. COBB: Then I start to panic. I realize I\\'m gonna regret this moment... ...that I need to see their faces one last time. WOMAN: James! Phillipa! Come on in! COBB: But the moment\\'s past. And whatever I do, I can\\'t change this moment. As I\\'m about to call out to them... ...they run away. If I\\'m ever gonna see their faces again, I\\'ve gotta get back home. The real world. [TRAIN APPROACHING] [SIREN WAILING IN THE DISTANCE] What are you doing here? My name is-- I know who you are. What are you doing here? I\\'m just trying to understand. How could you understand? Do you know what it is to be a lover? To be half of a whole? No. I\\'ll tell you a riddle. You\\'re waiting for a train. A train that will take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you... ...but you don\\'t know for sure. But it doesn\\'t matter. How can it not matter to you where that train will take you? COBB: Because you\\'ll be together. MAL: How could you bring her here, Dom? - What is this place? This is a hotel suite where we used to spend our anniversary. What happened here? You promised! You promised we\\'d be together! Please, I need you to stay here just for now! You said we\\'d be together! You said we\\'d grow old together! I\\'ll come back for you. I promise. [YELLING] Do you think you can just build a prison of memories to lock her in? Do you really think that that\\'s gonna contain her? SAITO: It\\'s time. Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney. - When\\'s the funeral? - Thursday. In Los Angeles. Robert should accompany the body no later than Tuesday. We should move. All right. - Cobb, I\\'m coming with you. - I promised Miles. No. The team needs someone who understands what you\\'re struggling with. And it doesn\\'t have to be me... ...but then you have to show Arthur what I just saw. Get us another seat on the plane. COBB: If I get on this plane and you don\\'t honor our agreement... ...when we land, I go to jail for the rest of my life. Complete the job en route... ...I make one phone call from the plane... ...you have no trouble getting through lmmigration. - I\\'m sorry. - Oh, yeah, absolutely. Thank you. Excuse me, I think this is yours? You must have dropped it. FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Would you care for a drink? Oh. Water, please. Oh, um, same, please. Um.... Thank you. You know, I couldn\\'t help but notice... ...but you wouldn\\'t happen to be related to the Maurice Fischer, would you? Yes, he, um.... He was my father. Well, he was a very inspiring figure. I\\'m sorry for your loss. - Here you go. - Thank you. COBB: Hey. To your father. May he rest in peace, huh? [MACHINE HISSING] [HORN HONKS] - Couldn\\'t have peed before you went under? - Sorry. Bit too much free champagne before takeoff? Ha, ha, bloody ha. We know he\\'s gonna be looking for a taxi in this weather. - Asshole! Hey, man, why don\\'t you try--? - Walk away. [MAN SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ON RADlO] [TURNS OFF RADlO] Just have him ca-- I gotta go. All right. Taxi. Thank you. All right, Third and Market. Snappy. - What are you doing? - Sorry, I thought it was free. - It\\'s not. - Maybe we could share. Maybe not. Can you pull over and get this--? Great. Come on. There\\'s $500 in there. The wallet\\'s worth more than that. You might at least drop me at my stop. I\\'m afraid that it doesn\\'t-- [GUNFIRE THEN EAMES GRUNTS] [TIRES SCREECHING] - Cover him! EAMES: Down! Down now! What the hell is going on? ARIADNE: This wasn\\'t in the design. Cobb? Cobb? [GUNFIRE] [YELLS] Get him! Are you all right? Yeah, I\\'m okay. I\\'m okay. Fischer\\'s okay, unless he gets carsick. Saito? COBB: Get Fischer in the back room now. - Get him in the back room. Move. ARTHUR: What the hell happened? COBB: Has he been shot? Is he dying? ARTHUR: I don\\'t know. - Jesus Christ. ARTHUR: What happened to you? - Blocked by a freight train. Why put a train in a downtown intersection? - I didn\\'t. ARTHUR: Where\\'d it come from? Why the hell were we ambushed? Those were not normal projections. They\\'d been trained, for God\\'s sakes. - How could he be trained? - Fischer\\'s had an extractor... ...teach his subconscious to defend itself, so his subconscious is militarized. It should\\'ve shown in the research. COBB: Why the hell didn\\'t it? - Calm down. COBB: Don\\'t tell me to calm down! This was your job, goddamn it! This was your responsibility! You were meant to check Fischer\\'s background! - We are not prepared for this! - We have dealt with sub-security before! We\\'ll be more careful and we\\'re gonna be fine! This was not a part of the plan! He\\'s dying. Put him out his misery. - No, don\\'t do that! Don\\'t do that. - Cobb, hey, hey. He\\'s in agony. I\\'m waking him up. No. It won\\'t wake him up. What do you mean, it won\\'t wake him up? When we die in a dream, we wake up. Not from this. We\\'re too heavily sedated to wake up that way. Right. So, what happens when we die? - We drop into limbo. - Are you serious? - Limbo? ARTHUR: Unconstructed dream space. ARIADNE: Well, what the hell is down there? - Just raw, infinite subconscious. Nothing is down there, except for what might have been left behind... ...by anyone sharing the dream who\\'s been trapped there before. Which, in our case, is just you. - How long could we be stuck? YUSUF: Can\\'t even think about... - ...trying to escape until the sedation-- - How long? Decades. It could be infinite. Ask him, he\\'s the one who\\'s been there. ARTHUR: Let\\'s get him upstairs. [GROANING] Great. Thank you. So now we\\'re trapped in Fischer\\'s mind, battling his own private army. And if we get killed... ...we\\'ll be lost in limbo till our brains turn to scrambled egg, hmm? ARTHUR: Someone got first aid? - You knew these risks and didn\\'t tell us? - There weren\\'t meant to be risks. - I didn\\'t know we\\'d be dealing with gunfire. - You had no right. This was the only way to go three layers deep. You knew about this and went along with it? I trusted him. When? When he promised you half his share? No. His whole share. Besides, he said he\\'d done it before. What, with Mal? Because that worked so good? That has nothing to do with it. I did what I had to to get to my children. You led us into a war zone with no way out? There is a way out. We continue on with the job, and we do it as fast as possible... ...and we get out using the kick, just like before. Forget it. We go any deeper, we just raise the stakes. I am sitting this one out on this level. COBB: Fischer\\'s security is surrounding this place. Ten hours of flight time is a week at this level. That means each and every one of us will be killed. That I can guarantee you. We have no other choice but to continue on and do it as fast as possible. Downwards is the only way forwards. Get ready. You, come on. Let\\'s go shake him up. I\\'m insured against kidnapping for up to 10 million. - This should be very simple. COBB: Shut up! It won\\'t be. ARTHUR: In your father\\'s office, below the bookshelves... ...is his personal safe. We need the combination. [SIGHS] I don\\'t know any safe. COBB: That doesn\\'t mean you don\\'t know the combination. Tell us what it is. I don\\'t know. We have it on good authority you do know. Yeah? Whose authority? - Five hundred dollars, this cost. EAMES: What\\'s inside it? Cash, cards, lD. And this. Useful? Maybe. You\\'re on. You\\'ve got an hour. An hour? I was supposed to have all night to crack this. And Saito wasn\\'t supposed to be shot in the chest. You\\'ve got one hour, now get us something useful, please. [SCREAMING] - What\\'s that? - Good authority. Uncle Peter. Just make them stop. - The combination. - I don\\'t know it. - Why does Browning say you do? - I don\\'t know. Just let me talk to him and I\\'ll find out. You have one hour. Start talking. FISCHER: You all right? [GROANING] You okay? Those bastards have had at me for two days. They have someone with access to your father\\'s office. - They\\'re trying to open his safe. - Yeah. They thought I\\'d know the combination, but I don\\'t know it. - Yeah, well, neither do l, so.... - What? Maurice told me that when he passed, you were the only one able to open it. No, he never gave me any combination. Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you just didn\\'t know it was a combination. Well, what, then? I don\\'t know, some meaningful combination of numbers... ...based on your experiences with Maurice. We didn\\'t have very many, uh, meaningful experiences together. Perhaps after your mother died. After my mother died, you know what he told me? \"Robert, there\\'s really nothing to be said.\" Oh, well, he was bad with emotion. I was 11, Uncle Peter. - How\\'s he doing? - He\\'s in a lot of pain. When we get down to the lower levels, the pain will be less intense. And if he dies? Worst-case scenario? When he wakes up, his mind is completely gone. Cobb, I\\'ll still honor the arrangement. COBB: I appreciate that, Saito. But when you wake up, you won\\'t even remember that we had an arrangement. Limbo is gonna become your reality. You\\'re gonna be lost down there so long that you\\'re gonna become an old man. Filled with regret? Waiting to die alone. No. I\\'ll come back. And we\\'ll be young men together again. Breathe. These people are gonna kill us if we don\\'t give them the combination. - They just wanna ransom us. - I heard them. They\\'re gonna lock us in that van, and then drive it into the river. All right. What is in the safe? Something for you. Maurice always said it was his most precious gift to you. - A will. - Maurice\\'s will is with Port and Dunn. That\\'s an alternate. This would supersede the other if you want it to. It splits up the component businesses of Fischer Morrow. It\\'d be the end of the entire empire as we know it. Destroying my whole inheritance? - Why would he suggest such a thing? - I just don\\'t know. He loved you, Robert. In his own way. FlSCHER: In his own way. At the end... ...he called me in to his deathbed. He could barely speak. But he took the trouble to tell me one last thing. He pulled me close. And I could only make out... ...one word. \"Disappointed.\" [SIGHS] When were you in limbo? You might have the rest of the team convinced to carry on with this job. - But they don\\'t know the truth. - Truth? What truth? The truth that, at any minute, you might bring a freight train through the wall. The truth that Mal is bursting through your subconscious. And the truth that, as we go deeper into Fischer... ...we\\'re also going deeper into you. And I\\'m not sure we\\'re gonna like what we find. We were working together. We were exploring the concept of a dream within a dream. I kept pushing things. I wanted to go deeper and deeper. I wanted to go further. I just didn\\'t understand the concept that hours could turn into years down there... ...that we could get trapped so deep... ...that when we wound up on the shore of our own subconscious... ...we lost sight of what was real. We created. We built the world for ourselves. We did that for years. We built our own world. How long were you stuck there? Something like 50 years. Jesus. How could you stand it? It wasn\\'t so bad at first, feeling like gods. Eventually, it just became impossible for me to live like that. And what about for her? She had locked something away, something deep inside her. A truth that she had once known, but chose to forget. Limbo became her reality. What happened when you woke up? Well, to wake up from that after years, after decades... ...to become old souls thrown back into youth like that? I knew something was wrong with her. She just wouldn\\'t admit it. Eventually, she told me the truth. She was possessed by an idea. This one very simple idea that changed everything. That our world wasn\\'t real. That she needed to wake up to come back to reality... ...that in order to get back home... ...we had to kill ourselves. - What about your children? - She thought they were projections... ...that our real children were waiting for us up there somewhere. MAL: I\\'m their mother! COBB: Calm down. I can tell the difference. If this is my dream, why can\\'t I control this? You don\\'t know you\\'re dreaming! COBB: She was certain there was nothing I could do... ...no matter how much I begged, no matter how much I pleaded. She wanted to do it, but she could not do it alone. She loved me too much, so she came up with a plan on our anniversary. - Sweetheart, what are you doing? - Join me. Just-- Just step back inside. All right? Just step back inside now, come on. No. I\\'m going to jump, and you\\'re coming with me. No, I\\'m not. Now, you listen to me. If you jump, you\\'re not gonna wake up, remember? You\\'re gonna die. Now, just step back inside. Come on. Step back inside so we can talk about this. We\\'ve talked enough. - Mal. - Come out onto the ledge... - ...or I\\'ll jump right now. - Okay. We\\'re gonna talk about this. All right? - I\\'m asking you to take a leap of faith. - No, honey. No, I can\\'t. You know I can\\'t do that. Take a second, think about our children. Think about James. Think about Phillipa, now. If I go without you, they\\'ll take them away anyway. - What does that mean? - I filed a letter with our attorney... ...explaining how I\\'m fearful for my safety. How you\\'ve threatened to kill me. - Why did you do this? - I love you, Dom. Why did--? Why would you do this to me? I\\'ve freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them. We\\'re going home to our real children. Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me, all right? Mal, look at me, please? You\\'re waiting for a train. - Mal, goddamn it, don\\'t do this! - A train that will take you far away. James and Phillipa are waiting for you! You know where you hope this train will take you, but you can\\'t know for sure. - Mal, look at me! - But it doesn\\'t matter. - Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me! - Because you\\'ll be together. Sweetheart! Look at me! Mal, no! Jesus Christ! She had herself declared sane by three different psychiatrists. It made it impossible for me to try to explain the nature of her madness. So I ran. [CHILDREN GIGGLING] MAN: Right now, or never, Cobb. WOMAN: James! Phillipa! Come on in! Come on! All right, let\\'s go. I left my children behind and I\\'ve been trying to buy my way back ever since. Your guilt defines her. It\\'s what powers her. But you are not responsible for the idea that destroyed her. And if we are gonna succeed in this... ...you have to forgive yourself, and you\\'re gonna have to confront her. But you don\\'t have to do that alone. - No, you\\'re not.... - I\\'m doing it for the others. Because they have no idea the risk they\\'ve taken coming down here with you. We have to move. Time\\'s up. All right. I don\\'t know any combination. - Not consciously, anyway. COBB: How about instinctively, huh? I got somebody in your father\\'s office right now ready to tap in the combination. Give me the first six numbers that come to your head right now. - I have no idea. - Right now! I said, right now! Right now! Five, two, eight, four, nine, one. You\\'ll have to do better than that. All right. Bag them. You\\'re going for a ride. FISCHER: We\\'re worth more to you alive. You hear me? What\\'d you get? Relationship with his father is worse than we imagined. This helps us how? The stronger the issues, the more powerful the catharsis. - How are we gonna reconcile them? - I\\'m working on that. Work faster. The projections are closing in quick. We gotta break out of here before we\\'re totally boxed in. Damn it. You mustn\\'t be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling. We need to shift his animosity from his father to his godfather. - Destroy his one positive relationship? - No, repair his relationship with his father... ...whilst exposing his godfather\\'s true nature. We should charge Fischer a lot more than Saito for this job. His security is gonna get worse as we go deeper. - I think we run with Mr. Charles. - No. EAMES: Who\\'s Mr. Charles? - Bad idea. The second we get into that hotel his security\\'s gonna be all over us. We run with Mr. Charles like on the Stein job. - You\\'ve done it before? ARTHUR: Yeah, and it didn\\'t work. The subject realized he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces. Excellent. But you learned a lot, right? - I need some kind of distraction. EAMES: No problem. How about a lovely lady that I\\'ve used before? Listen to me. You drive carefully, all right? Everything down there is gonna be unstable as hell. Don\\'t jump too soon. We only got one shot at that kick. We gotta make it. I\\'ll play the music to let you know it\\'s coming. The rest is on you. - You ready? - Ready! Sweet dreams. WOMAN: Am I boring you? I was telling you my story. I guess it wasn\\'t to your liking. Um, I have a lot on my mind. There goes Mr. Charles. Mr. Fischer, right? Pleasure to see you again. Rod Green from marketing. I-- Hmm. - And you must be? - Leaving. In case you get bored. Must\\'ve blown you off. That is, unless her phone number really is only six digits. Funny way to make friends, someone stealing your wallet like that. [SCOFFS] Goddamn it. The wallet alone is worth at least 500-- About $500, right? Don\\'t worry about it. My people are already on it as we speak. Who or what is Mr. Charles? It\\'s a gambit designed to turn Fischer against his own subconscious. ARIADNE: And why don\\'t you approve? It involves telling the mark that he\\'s dreaming... ...which involves attracting a lot of attention to us. - Didn\\'t Cobb say never to do that? - Hmm. So now you\\'ve noticed how much time... ...Cobb spends doing things he says never to do. Mr. Saito, can I have a moment? - I\\'m sorry, but.... MAN: Hold on! Wait! You look a bit perkier. Very amusing, Mr. Eames. [RUMBLING] Turbulence on the plane? No, it\\'s much closer. That\\'s Yusuf\\'s driving. [TIRES SCREECHING] [GLASSES CLINKING] Um, I\\'m sorry. Who did you say you were? COBB: Rod Green from marketing. But that\\'s not true at all, is it? My name is Mr. Charles. You remember me, don\\'t you? I\\'m the head of your security down here. Get out on a different floor, keep moving. Dump the wallet. Security will be looking for that. - Okay. - We need to buy Cobb a little more time. [COUGHING] Security, huh? - You work for the hotel? - No, no. I specialize in a very specific type of security. Subconscious security. You\\'re talking about dreams? Are you talking about, um, extraction? I am here to protect you. [GLASS SHATTERS] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [CHATTERING STOPS] Mr. Fischer, I\\'m here to protect you in the event... ...that someone tries to access your mind through your dreams. You\\'re not safe here. They\\'re coming for you. [YELLS] Strange weather, isn\\'t it? You feel that? What\\'s happening? Cobb\\'s drawing Fischer\\'s attention to the strangeness of the dream... ...which is making his subconscious look for the dreamer. For me. Quick, give me a kiss. - They\\'re still looking at us. - Yeah, it was worth a shot. We should probably get out of here. [GUNFlRE] COBB: You feel that? You\\'ve actually been trained for this, Mr. Fischer. Pay attention to the strangeness of the weather, the shift in gravity. None of this is real. You\\'re in a dream. Now, the easiest way for you to test yourself... ...is to try and remember how you arrived at this hotel. Can you do that? Yeah, l.... COBB: No, breathe, breathe. Remember your training. Accept the fact that you\\'re in a dream, and I\\'m here to protect you. Go on. Mm-hm. - You\\'re not real? - No. No. I\\'m a projection of your subconscious. I was sent here to protect you in the event... ...that extractors tried to pull you into a dream. And I believe that\\'s what\\'s going on right now, Mr. Fischer. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Can you get me out of here? Right away. Follow me. Hold on a second. Jesus Christ! What are you doing? These men were sent here to abduct you, all right? If you want my help, you have to remain calm. I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer. If this is a dream, I should just kill myself to wake up, right? I wouldn\\'t do that if I were you, Mr. Fischer. I believe they have you sedated, and if you pull that trigger... ...you may not wake up. You may go into a further dream state. Now, you know what I\\'m talking about. You remember the training. Remember what I said to you. Give me the gun. - This room should be directly below 528? - Yeah. [SAFE BEEPS] Think, Mr. Fischer, think. What do you remember from before this dream? There was, um, a lot of gunfire. There was rain. Uncle Peter. - Oh, my God, we\\'ve been kidnapped. - Where were they holding you? - They had us in the back of a van. - That explains the gravity shifts. You\\'re in the back of a van. Keep going. It had something to do with, um.... Something to do with a safe. God, why is it so hard to remember? It\\'s like trying to remember a dream after you\\'ve woken up. Listen, it takes years of practice. You and Browning have been pulled into this dream... ...because they\\'re trying to steal something from your mind. I need you to focus and try and remember what that is. What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think! A combination. They demanded the first numbers to pop into my head. They\\'re trying to extract a number from your subconscious. It can represent anything. We\\'re in a hotel right now. We should try hotel rooms. What was the number, Mr. Fischer? Try and remember for me. This is very important. Five. Five, two-- It was something, it was a long number. That\\'s good. We can start there. Fifth floor. Yep. - So do you use a timer? - No, I have to judge it for myself. While you\\'re all asleep in 528, I wait for Yusuf\\'s kick. - Well, how will you know? - His music warns me. And then when the van hits the barrier of the bridge, that should be unmistakable. So we get a nice synchronized kick. If it\\'s too soon, we won\\'t get pulled out. But if it\\'s too late, I won\\'t be able to drop us. - Well, why not? - Because the van will be in freefall. - Can\\'t drop you without gravity. - Right. They\\'re with me. Go on. Mr. Charles. - Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer? - Yeah, I think so. They were trying to put you under. - I\\'m already under. - Under again. What do you mean, a dream within a dream? Hey. I see you\\'ve changed. I\\'m sorry? Oh, I\\'m sorry. I mistook you for a friend. Oh. Good-looking fellow, I\\'m sure. No, no, no. That\\'s Fischer\\'s projection of Browning. Let\\'s follow him and see how he behaves. - Why? - Because how he acts will tell us... ...if Fischer is starting to suspect his motives the way we want him to. Shh. [DOOR OPENS] - Uncle Peter. - You said you were kidnapped together? Well, not exactly. They already had him. They were torturing him. And you saw them torture him? The kidnappers are working for you? Robert. You\\'re trying to get that safe open? To get the alternate will? Fischer Morrow has been my entire life. I can\\'t let you destroy it. I\\'m not gonna throw away my inheritance. I couldn\\'t let you rise to your father\\'s last taunt. - What taunt? - The will, Robert. That will? That\\'s his last insult. A challenge for you to build something for yourself... ...by telling you you\\'re not worthy of his accomplishments. - What, but that he was, um, disappointed? - I\\'m sorry. But he\\'s wrong. You can build a better company than he ever did. Mr. Fischer? He\\'s lying. - How do you know? - Trust me, it\\'s what I do. He\\'s hiding something, and we need to find out what that is. I need you to do the same thing to him that he was going to do to you. We\\'ll enter his subconscious and find out what he doesn\\'t want you to know. All right. [MACHINE HISSING] COBB: He\\'s out. - Wait. Whose subconscious are we going into exactly? We\\'re going into Fischer\\'s. I told him it was Browning\\'s so he\\'d be a part of our team. He\\'s gonna help us break into his own subconscious. COBB: That\\'s right. Security\\'s gonna run you down hard. And I will lead them on a merry chase. - Just be back before the kick. - Go to sleep, Mr. Eames. ARTHUR: You good? Hey. You ready? Yes, yes. I\\'m fine. I\\'m ready. ARIADNE: Cobb? Cobb? What\\'s down there? Hopefully, the truth we want Fischer to learn. I mean, what\\'s down there for you? [SHOTGUN COCKS] [GUNFIRE THEN YUSUF YELLS] [ELEVATOR DINGS] [YUSUF YELLS] [BOTH GRUNTING] [METAL GROANING] [SECURITY GUARD SCREAMING] [YELLING] [GUNSHOT] [LAUGHS] Did you see that? COBB: Eames, this is your dream. I need you to draw the security away from the complex, understand? - Who guides Fischer in? COBB: Not me. If I know the route, everything could be compromised. - I designed the place. COBB: No, you\\'re with me. SAITO: I could do it. All right. Brief him on the route into the complex. - Fischer, you\\'ll be going with him. - All right. What about you? You keep this live. I\\'ll be listening in the whole time. The windows on that upper floor are big enough for me to cover you from that tower. FISCHER: You\\'re not coming in? In order to find out the truth about your father... ...you\\'re gonna need to break into Browning\\'s mind on your own. SAITO: Come on, Fischer! [BUZZER SOUNDING] - Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm! - Go, go, go! Move! Go! [GUNFlRE] YUSUF: Sod it. I hope you\\'re ready. [\"NON, JE NE REGRETTE RlEN\" PLAYING] [SONG ECHOING] No, it\\'s too soon. [SONG ECHOING] Cobb, do you hear that? I first noticed it about 20 minutes ago, I thought it was the wind up here. Yeah, I hear it. It\\'s music. So, what do we do? We move fast. Yusuf\\'s 10 seconds from the jump. Which gives Arthur three minutes. - Hey! - That\\'s him! - Which gives us what? - Sixty minutes. - Can they make that route in an hour? - They have to climb to the terrace. Then they need a new route, a more direct route. [SHOUTS lNDlSTlNCTLY] It\\'s designed as a labyrinth. There must be access routes that cut through the maze. Eames? [GUNFlRE] Did Eames add any features? I don\\'t think I should tell you. We don\\'t have time for this. Did he add anything? He added an air-duct system that can cut through the maze. Good. Explain it to them. ARlADNE: Saito? - Go ahead. [SECURlTY GUARD GRUNTS] Paradox. [SCREAMS THEN THUDS] [BOTH GASPING] ARlADNE: What was that? - The kick. Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it? Yeah, we missed it. FISCHER: Man. Couldn\\'t someone have dreamt up a goddamn beach? Huh? Uh-huh. EAMES [OVER RADlO]: Well, what the hell do we do now? We finish the job before the next kick. - What next kick? - When the van hits the water. WOMAN [ON RECORDING]: If you\\'d like to make a call, please hang up and try again. If you need help, hang up.... How do I drop you without gravity? Arthur has a couple minutes, and we have about 20. [SAITO COUGHING] You okay? SOLDlER: Run! Turn around! Move to base! Move to base! Go, go, go! There\\'s something wrong. They\\'re heading your way, like they know something. Just buy us more time, all right? - Come on! - On my way. SOLDlER: Come on! Move! [SlLENCED GUNSHOT] [BOTH GRUNTING] All right. [SlLENCED GUNSHOT] Okay. That\\'s the antechamber outside the strong room. - Does the strong room have windows? - lt wouldn\\'t be very strong if it did. Let\\'s hope Fischer likes what he finds in there. - Are those projections his subconscious? - Yes. - Are you destroying parts of his mind? - No. They\\'re just projections. [COUGHS] [SAITO COUGHING] - We\\'re here. - You\\'re clear, but hurry. There\\'s an entire army headed your way. [WHlSPERS] I\\'m in. [STATlC OVER RADlO] [TURNS RADlO OFF] SOLDlER: There he is. - There\\'s someone in there. - Fischer, it\\'s a trap. Get out. Come on. Come on, a little lower. ARlADNE: Cobb. No, she is not real. How do you know that? She is just a projection. Fischer. Fischer is real. [GRUNTS] Hello. ARlADNE: Eames! Eames, get to the antechamber now! EAMES: What happened? - Mal killed Fischer. I couldn\\'t shoot her. There\\'s no use in reviving him. His mind\\'s already trapped down there. It\\'s all over. So that\\'s it, then? We failed? We\\'re done. I\\'m sorry. It\\'s not me that doesn\\'t get back to my family, is it? Shame. I wanted to know what was gonna happen in there. I swear we had this. Let\\'s set the charges. No, there\\'s still another way. - We have to follow Fischer down there. - Not enough time. No, but there will be enough time down there. And we will find him. Okay, as soon as Arthur\\'s music kicks in, just use the defibrillator to revive him. We can give him his own kick down below. Look, you get him in there. As soon as the music ends, you blow up the hospital... ...and we all ride the kick back up the layers. It\\'s worth a shot, if Saito can hold the guards off while I set the charges. Saito will never make it, will he? - Cobb, come on. We\\'ve gotta try this. - Go for it. If you are not back before the kick, I am gone with or without you. She\\'s right. She\\'s right. Come on. Let\\'s go. Can I trust you to do what needs to happen here? Mal\\'s gonna be down there. I know where to find her. She\\'ll have Fischer. - How do you know? - Because she wants me to come after him. She wants me back down there with her. All right? - This is your world? - lt was. And this is where she\\'ll be. Come on. [GUNFlRE] Saito. Saito. I need you to take care of Fischer while I go set some charges, okay? No room for tourists on these jobs. Don\\'t be silly. ARlADNE: You built all this? This is incredible. We built for years. Then we started in on the memories. This way. COBB: This was our neighborhood. Places from our past. That was our first apartment. Then we moved to that building right there. After Mal became pregnant, that became our home. You reconstructed all of this from memory? Like I told you, we had lots of time. ARlADNE: What is that? That\\'s the house Mal grew up in. - Well, will she be in there? - No. Come on. We both wanted to live in a house, but we loved this type of building. In the real world, we\\'d have to choose, but not here. [GRUNTS] [GUNFlRE] [GRUNTS] [BEEPS] [BEEPS] [BEEPS] How are we gonna bring Fischer back? We\\'re gonna have to come up with some kind of a kick. What? I\\'m gonna improvise. Listen, there\\'s something you should know about me. About inception. [BOTH GRUNTING] [GUNFlRE] An idea is like a virus. Resilient. Highly contagious. And the smallest seed of an idea can grow. It can grow to define... ...or destroy you. MAL: The smallest idea, such as: \"Your world is not real.\" Simple little thought that changes everything. So certain of your world. Of what\\'s real. Do you think he is? Or do you think he\\'s as lost as I was? COBB: I know what\\'s real, Mal. No creeping doubts? Not feeling persecuted, Dom? Chased around the globe... ...by anonymous corporations and police forces... ...the way the projections persecute the dreamer? Admit it. You don\\'t believe in one reality anymore. So choose. Choose to be here. Choose me. [COUGHS] You know what I have to do. I have to get back to our children because you left them. Because you left us. - You\\'re wrong. COBB: I\\'m not wrong. You\\'re confused. Our children are here. And you\\'d like to see their faces again, wouldn\\'t you? Yes, but I\\'m gonna see them up above, Mal. [GUNFlRE] [BEEPS] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [SAITO COUGHING] Up above? Listen to yourself. These are our children. Watch. James? Phillipa? Don\\'t do this, Mal. Please. Those aren\\'t my children. You keep telling yourself that, but you don\\'t believe it. - No, I know it. - What if you\\'re wrong? What if I\\'m what\\'s real? You keep telling yourself what you know. But what do you believe? What do you feel? Guilt. I feel guilt, Mal. And no matter what I do, no matter how hopeless I am... ...no matter how confused, that guilt is always there... ...reminding me of the truth. What truth? That the idea that caused you to question your reality came from me. You planted the idea in my mind? What is she talking about? The reason I knew inception was possible was because I did it to her first. - I did it to my own wife. - Why? We were lost in here. I knew we needed to escape, but she wouldn\\'t accept it. She had locked something away, something deep inside. A truth that she had once known, but chose to forget. And she couldn\\'t break free. So I decided to search for it. I went deep into the recess of her mind and found that secret place. And I broke in... ...and I planted an idea. A simple little idea that would change everything. That her world wasn\\'t real. That death was the only escape. You\\'re waiting for a train. [METAL GROANING] A train that\\'ll take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you... ...but you can\\'t know for sure. Yet it doesn\\'t matter. - Now, tell me why! - Because you\\'ll be together! COBB: But I never knew that that idea would grow in her mind like a cancer... ...that even after she woke.... That even after you came back to reality... ...that you\\'d continue to believe your world wasn\\'t real. That death was the only escape. Mal, no! Jesus! - You infected my mind. - I was trying to save you. You betrayed me. But you can make amends. You can still keep your promise. We can still be together, right here... ...in the world we built together. [COUGHING] [BEEPS] [GUNFlRE] [GRUNTS] [\"NON, JE NE REGRETTE RlEN\" PLAYING] [SONG ECHOING] [DEFlBRlLLATOR CHARGING] [THUNDER CRASHING] Cobb, we need to get Fischer. You can\\'t have him. - lf I stay here, will you let him go? - What are you talking about? Fischer is on the porch. - Go check he\\'s alive, Ariadne. - Cobb, you can\\'t do this. Go check he\\'s alive right now. Do it. [ARlADNE GRUNTING] He\\'s here! And it\\'s time, but you have to come now! COBB: You take Fischer with you, all right? - You can\\'t stay here to be with her. I\\'m not. Saito\\'s dead by now. That means he\\'s down here somewhere. That means I have to find him. I can\\'t stay with her anymore, because she doesn\\'t exist. I\\'m the only thing you do believe in anymore. No. I wish. I wish more than anything, but... ...I can\\'t imagine you with all your complexity... ...all your perfection, all your imperfection. - You all right? - Yeah. Look at you. You\\'re just a shade. You\\'re just a shade of my real wife. And you were the best that I could do, but... ...I\\'m sorry, you\\'re just not good enough. Does this feel real? [GUNSHOT] - What are you doing? - lmprovising. [GASPING] No, no, no! In there, now. Go, go, go. I was dis-- I was dis-- Disa-- - I know, Dad. - Dis-- I know you were disappointed... ...I couldn\\'t be you. No. No, no, no. I was disappointed... ...that you tried. [BEEPING] What? Come on, come on. Dad? [SOBBING] That\\'s the kick, Ariadne! You have to go now! Don\\'t lose yourself! Find Saito and bring him back! I will! You remember when you asked me to marry you? Yes. You said you dreamt that we\\'d grow old together. But we did. We did. You don\\'t remember? I miss you more than I can bear... ...but we had our time together. And I have to let you go. I have to let you go. I\\'m sorry, Robert.

He\\'s gaining on the pack. <font color=\"#808080\">ANNOUNCER:</font> And down the front stretch. Moving into fourth position... third... Now, second! Going to the outside as they cross the bricks!

It\\'s just that you guys are, you know, kind of slow-ish. <font color=\"#808080\">ALL:</font> Oh! Really? To our faces? Theo, what are you doing? Now, I\\'m gonna pretend I didn\\'t hear what I clearly just heard. Heard what? <font color=\"#D900D9\">(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)</font> I didn\\'t hear anything. Nothing out of order, did you, Theo? Oh, I meant what I said. Then you better put your money where your mouth is. Snails don\\'t have money. Otherwise, we\\'d be able to pay the bills. Remember? Your trash talk is needlessly complicated. Is it? Or is it that your unpaid bills are overdue? Enough talk. It\\'s time for action. It\\'s simple. First one to the top of that shooting star wins. <font color=\"#D900D9\">(SCOFFS)</font> You guys? Way up there, huh? Awesome. Let me get my calendar so I can time you. <font color=\"#D900D9\">(SCOFFS)</font> Oh, you got jokes, rookie? Laugh it up, garden snail.

Planning a \"taco-volution\"! It\\'s a little concept that I came up with. When you combine the words... \"Taco\" and \"revolution.\" I get it. But how is that supposed to help us sell tacos? Patience, bro. Taco-volutions don\\'t happen in a day. <font color=\"#D900D9\">(SINGING)</font> Tacos, I say Talking about a taco-volution <font color=\"#D900D9\">(GROANS)</font> Sauce and chips Mmm. .. <font color=\"#808080\">TOUR BUS DRIVER:</font> And next up on our tour is the L.A.

So, what\\'s your plan, huh? Stay here in this rundown strip mall? With a bunch of lunatic snails, and a nutso taco man who is using you to sell Mexican food? Because if that\\'s your plan, then whoopty-skippy-do, sign me up! My ears are burning. I hope you\\'re not talking about me. You two seem to have a special connection, Little Amigo, and Snail Who Seems To Be Friends With Little Amigo. Is this your mother? <font color=\"#D900D9\">(LAUGHING)</font> Your sister? Oh! Say no more. It\\'s your girlfriend. <font color=\"#D900D9\">(SNORTING)</font> <font color=\"#D900D9\">(GRUMBLES)</font> Ah, she\\'s a cutie. Ow! Hmm. Women. <font color=\"#D900D9\">(SIGHS)</font> I have to admit, I was kind of hoping the taco-volution would\\'ve started by now. <font color=\"#D900D9\">(SIGHS)</font> <font color=\"#D900D9\">(GROANS)</font> It doesn\\'t make sense. With my brains and your speed, we should be destined for greatness, right? We need to think big, Little Amigo. I\\'m talking commercials, talk shows, county fairs. Flea markets. No, farmers\\' markets. No, supermarkets. We\\'ll cover all the markets. Quinceañeras, confirmations, graduations. <font color=\"#D900D9\">(GASPS)</font> The Indy 500. Ooh, I got it. We can have our very own telenovela! What? No. Oh... <font color=\"#808080\">THEO:</font> <font color=\"#D900D9\">(LAUGHING)</font> Whoo! This is it, Chet. I knew we ended up here for a reason. <font color=\"#808080\">CHET:</font> Will you just slow down for a second? Slow down? Are you kidding? I\\'m never going slow again! Theo, stop. Oh! What are you trying to say? I wanna enter him in the Indy 500. The Indy 500? What are you talking about? What is he talking about? Now, look, I know it may sound a little crazy... No, no, no, Tito, that doesn\\'t sound crazy. Dos Bros Tacos and Sushi. That was crazy. What? People love sushi. Dos Bros Tacos and Monkey Petting Zoo. That was crazy. The babies were cute. The adults were just so mean. Taco Man and his sidekick, the Churro. Oh, that was off-the-hook crazy! <font color=\"#D900D9\">(SCOFFS)</font> Crazy awesome. But this, Tito? This is in a category all by itself. Angelo, please. Come on, Chet. Just hear me out. Theo, a snail cannot race in a competition meant for cars. There are rules. Actually, I\\'ve been doing a lot of research, and there\\'s nothing in the rules that says a snail can\\'t enter the race. There\\'s nothing that says this sponge can\\'t enter the race either, but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s ever gonna happen. Millions of people watch that race. Uh-huh. This could put us on the map, bro. Trying to work, here. Oh, come on, Angelo. All we have to do is raise the $20,000 registration fee. What? I figured, once we sell the truck... Sell the... Are you even listening to yourself, Tito? You want to invest our entire life savings in a snail! I\\'m telling you, this snail crawled into our lives for a reason. I think he could be our little shooting star. Did you hear that, Chet? This guy believes in me. That guy is as crazy as you are. They\\'ll never let you into that race. And even if they did, you wouldn\\'t survive one lap. Yeah, but... Angelo, listen... Tito! Theo! Not every dream is meant to come true. Yeah, what he said. <font color=\"#D900D9\">(BOTH SIGH)</font> <font color=\"#D900D9\">(CHUCKLES)</font> A snail in the Indy 500. What will you think of next? <font color=\"#D900D9\">(SIGHS)</font> <font color=\"#D900D9\">(REVVING)</font> <font color=\"#D900D9\">(CHUCKLES)</font> Don\\'t worry, Little Amigo. We\\'ll get that entrance fee somehow. <font color=\"#D900D9\">(METAL DOORS CLOSING)</font> Hmm. Now, I know some people may say $20,000 sounds like a lot of money. It is a lot of money. And I know some people may say I\\'m crazy. But I say, when a snail crawls into your life at 200 miles an hour, then you\\'d have to be crazy not to grab onto that shell, and take a ride of a lifetime. <font color=\"#D900D9\">(GASPS)</font> Now, in case you\\'re still not convinced... Boom!

Who\\'s ready to sponsor the next Indy 500 champion? <font color=\"#D900D9\">(SQUEAKING)</font> Sorry, Tito, but I\\'ve got work to do. No, you don\\'t. None of you do. I don\\'t get it. That poster was awesome. Oh, well, good try, you did your best. Time to go home, Theo. Oh, we\\'re going to Indianapolis, Chet. Don\\'t you worry your chubby little face about that.

Good luck out there, Turbo! <font color=\"#D900D9\">(ENGINES ROARING)</font> Did anybody bring earplugs? What? Oh, I can\\'t watch this. The pace car is off and the parade laps are underway.

      " \"            For the past   5 days, I have   been battered to a black and blue Jennifer. Wednesday, volleyball camp started. Although I was siked to start the season, I was a bit dicey when it came to the new coaching staff. Our head coach, Amber, and her assistant, Jess, are both 24 year old recent graduates of Alderson Broadus. When sports teams have a two week window in June when they can practice, we worked our butts off learning a new defense. Instead of running the defensive rotation that has been pounded into our heads since freshman year, we are now told to do the complete opposite. It might actually work if everyone on the team knew what was going on, but when we get out on the court everything falls apart. It doesn't look good.    After camp ended at 4pm everyday, I raced home to quickly take a shower. As fast as I could, I would eat a small dinner and head to work. I seriously almost fell asleep at work one day. Working till 9 each night, then going to bed at 10 is not my idea of a cool summer. I've missed Footloose, my friends, my family, and meals.    I've just now started to recover from this volleyball-then-work life. But guess what! I can't write anymore right now because I must be at work in 15 minutes.     &nbsp;   Current Mood - Where's my Starbucks doubleshot expresso?     &nbsp;   Currently Playing - 'Eye of the Tiger' - the one in the Starbucks commercial.             \"\n",
      " 'What if, once upon a time, there were no stars in the sky at all? What if the stars are not what we think? What if the light from afar doesn\\'t come from the rays of distant suns... but from our wings as we turn into angels? Destiny calls to each of us. And there is a world behind the world where we are all connected. All part of a great and moving plan. Magic is everywhere around us. You just have to look. Look. Look closely. For even time and distance are not what they appear to be. Next. Sir, you\\'re next. I\\'m sorry. You\\'ll have to go back. What? No. No. Why? We... It\\'s pulmonary. Ah... What about the baby? Is there place for him? If we have to go back, we leave him. I\\'m sorry. No. You do not understand. We are all connected. Each baby born carries a miracle inside. A unique purpose. And that miracle is promised to one person and one person alone. We are voyagers, set on a course towards destiny... lo find the one person our miracle is meant for. But be warned: As we seek out the light... darkness gathers. And the eternal contest between Good and Evil is not fought with great armies... but one fife at a time. Stop right there! Get back here, Pete! - Get back here! - Unh! Pete, them was just orders! No. Not like that. We have him now. Let\\'s do it slowly... with the knives. Get him! Horse. Horse. Horse. Go, go, go! Go on! Whoa. Whoa, whoa! Whoa. Horse! Come on! Other away! Other way! Horse! What are you? He\\'s got the goddamn horse. Good afternoon. The butler told me I should leave my coat on. Mm. We have fever in the house. Is it your wife that needs spectacles, Mr. Penn? Dead. I\\'m sorry. It\\'s eight years ago. Still, you never stop missing them. It\\'s for my daughter. She\\'ll be finished soon. It is nice, isn\\'t it? Brahms. Beverly... this man has come to make you some new glasses. Don\\'t worry, it\\'s not contagious. No, no. My sister... she had it. Oh, I\\'m sorry. Better this way... or this way? How old was she? Your sister? Twenty... when she died. You never think you\\'re as old as you\\'re ever going to get. No. I suppose not. This way... or this? First. The fever, it can make things wonderful. Even now... I can see winter as it turns around the room on the light... darting from white lances... to rays... to silver crosses... to the optical glass... to the flames, to the reflective windows. And illuminating each of us. The sicker I become... the more clearly I can see that everything is connected by light. Do you have glasses for that? Hey, Cecil. Jesus, Mary and Joseph. Yeah, he\\'s something, isn\\'t he? And, boy, can he jump. I want a saddle, oats... and I want a nice blanket for him. Cashmere. He\\'s the best duff you ever stole, Pete. Oh, he ain\\'t duff, Cecil. He\\'s me new partner. Aren\\'t you, horse? - You can\\'t keep hiding out up in the attic. - Why? Word went out, Pearly\\'s tripled the reward. He\\'s got his guys looking everywhere. Ugly son of a bitch. He found me this morning. Horse saved my life. I think I\\'ll get out of town till summer, you know? Me and horse. Steal enough to get us by. Just let this whole thing blow over, you know? I don\\'t see Pearly much as the blowing-over kind. Yeah. - That\\'s because you worry too much, Cecil. - Heh. Just board him for me, will you? Thanks. Pete! You forgot your.. Change. I was wondering when you\\'d get here. May I have your attention please. Train number 43... is now boarding on Track Number 4. Enter! The fire at St. Paddy\\'s is set for Sunday Mass. That\\'s not what matters to me. We got the word out to everyone: 500 for his head. - And the horse? - The same. Seems like a lot for a horse. Well, that\\'s because it\\'s not a horse. - It\\'s a dog. - You just said it was a... As far as we can tell, he hasn\\'t left the city. Woola boys are watching all the bridges. New York\\'s not that big. We\\'ll find him. - You better. - I know, boss. People are scared and unhappy all over the city. Miracles are down by half. More if you count Brooklyn. What\\'s so special about Peter? You used to like him. Never met me a better thief. - Why all of a sudden, we gotta kill him? - Romeo, Romeo. Do you spend time... wondering about the world? The workings of things. - No, sir. - Right. Well... better not to start now. Do you think I, uh, steal gold and gems for wealth? No. What makes these most precious... it\\'s the way they accept the light. Peter Lake is human. But that horse... That horse might leave a trail. And Yahtzee! Grand Central Station. Let\\'s go and kill him. And while we\\'re at it, let\\'s try and grab that horse. You just said it was a dog. Go and get the boys. Hi. Hey. Everybody\\'s all packed to go up to the lake tomorrow. I\\'ll come up the next day, sweetheart. Daddy just has to get my tent ready. So you can stay cold? So I can stay cold. You can\\'t die, Bev. Sweet girl... it\\'s not up to me. Tell me again. There\\'s this great dance... and we all have our part. And when we\\'re done here... if it\\'s after one life, or a thousand... we rise up into the sky and we become stars. Tell me their names again. Castor... Pollux... Capella... It\\'s a great night\\'s work, my friend. We head south to Florida. Or Maryland, maybe. That sounds like the kind of place you might like. All right, let\\'s go. Horse. Horse. Come on. Horse, it\\'s gonna be light soon. We need to get out of town. Pearly\\'s got a hundred eyes looking after us. Come on. Come on. Hor... You\\'re just getting greedy now. Fine. But this is our last score. Don\\'t know who\\'s a bigger fool: A horse who won\\'t listen to his master, or a master who listens to his horse. God, make me cold. Hello, you beauty. James... James the Lesser, Bartholomew... Squeaks. What? It squeaks. Age. You have a gun. Right. What are you doing here? I was just robbing the place, you know. Or that was the idea, anyway. Is that still your intention? Uh... No. No, it isn\\'t. Well, then... I suppose the polite thing to do would be to offer you a cup of tea. Wow. You did understand the part about me... coming here to steal from you, yeah? It\\'s my father, technically. I broke in. Where? He takes epic measures to bar entry. Well, actually, you left the door to the roof wedged open. So I just... - Did I? - Yeah. I must stop doing that. Yeah. I mean, you should be scared. Well, I\\'m not. No, I can see that. The tea is lovely. It\\'s called Lapsang Souchong. It\\'s black and from China. It\\'s too hot for me to drink... but the smell always reminds me of London. I\\'ve never been to London. I didn\\'t think so. No. Heh. I was born there. What\\'s wrong with you, if you don\\'t mind me asking? Consumption. I\\'m 21 and I\\'ve never been kissed on the mouth. Sorry, that came out wrong. I don\\'t know anyone, you see. I can\\'t go out. I can\\'t dance. I sleep in a tent on the roof to keep my body temperature within reason. I have maybe... according to one doctor who came up from Baltimore, a year and a half. In Boston, they said six months. But that was eight months ago... so really, I\\'m already two months dead. I\\'m Peter Lake. And where are you from, Peter Lake? A boat. - A boat? - Yeah. I never knew my parents. Boat washed up ashore in Brooklyn. So I was told. And you steal things. I do steal things. Yeah, from time to time. It wasn\\'t always that way, though. I always wanted to be a mechanic. You know, I always had a knack... for fixing things, getting to the insides of things. Like safes. Well, that\\'s how it ended up, anyways. Lately, I\\'ve been having a bit of a disagreement with an old boss. I should imagine disputes in your line of work are hard to settle. Challenging, yeah. What\\'s the best thing you\\'ve ever stolen? I\\'m beginning to think I haven\\'t stolen it yet. Aren\\'t you the charmer. It\\'s been lovely. Lovely to meet you, Peter Lake. Listen, I have to leave New York. A few months at most. Let that disagreement blow over. But maybe when I get back, I was wondering if... I\\'m going to the country myself. And by the time you get back... I\\'ll already be dead. Please don\\'t steal anything on your way out. Horse. What have you gotten me into, horse? Table! That one. Mr. Soames, sir. How many are you going to have? Just keep them coming. I\\'ll tell you what they\\'re trying to do. What they\\'re trying to do is to fill the whole sky with stars. They got little spots all picked out up there for each and every virtuous soul. Ain\\'t no room in the heavens for the likes of us, though, boys. Heh. No room for Pearly Soames. No room at all. I wonder how they choose the color of their wings. I\\'ve always wanted wings. I\\'d like a pair of wings myself, you know? Anything more, sir? Oh, yes, please. I would like to have a South African spotted eagle owl... uh, if you could butterfly it, thank you... and pan-fry it, uh, with some potatoes would be lovely. A little bit of parsley on top. Take off the beak and the feet, please. I\\'m sorry, sir. Don\\'t got no owl. Find her. You find her, and you\\'re gonna find him. - Find who? - The girl. - What girl? - The red-haired girl. Which red-haired girl? That one. You see, Romeo? That red-haired girl. The one who is his destiny. That all of it, miss? All of it? Heh. No, not even close. What? I just remembered the day we pulled you out of the drink in that silly little boat. I need some friendly advice. I met a girl. - Oh, I see. - We\\'ve nothing in common. Hmm. - She\\'s dying. - Well, aren\\'t we all? Well, not just dying. She\\'s consumptive. - Ah. - Near death. We\\'ve only just met. - I feel like I\\'ve known her a thousand years. - Hmm. Pearly\\'s on top of me. If I don\\'t get out of town, I\\'m as good as killing myself. Peter, is there a question here? What should I do? When I think of her... I\\'ve never felt this way before. Why now? Peter, our people have 10 songs. The songs tell us that inside of each of us is a miracle. And that miracle is meant for one person, and one person alone. And when we\\'re close, the universe reaches down... and helps us fulfill our destiny. And the universe helps us? How, exactly? Well, the universe sends us spirit guides. Sometimes they speak to us through small children. They often appear as animals. One is Athansor. He\\'s the Dog of the East. He sometimes appears as a white horse. Perhaps this girl is the person that your miracle is for. But if so, know this: - Chaos has agents too. - What are you talking about? God and the devil? Angels and demons? Those are some of the newer names, yes. All I know... is that I\\'m pulled to her... like air when I\\'m under the water. So, what are you standing here talking to me for? Driver? I\\'m afraid he\\'s become indisposed. Suddenly come into a small fortune by his standards, I imagine. Pearly Soames. And you might be? Beverly Penn. Beverly Penn. Well... Peter does like to reach above his station, doesn\\'t he? And you\\'ve got a touch of the fever, haven\\'t you, button? Already only half here. Interesting. You know Peter? Peter Lake? Know him? Oh, yes. We\\'re associates, you might say. Well... past tense, anyway. The boy had such potential. Could he steal. Like art, like physics. I raised him as my own. I had him pegged to inherit the keys to the kingdom. But little Peter... he started to having ideas. There\\'s how to steal a diamond brooch without spilling blood. Here\\'s how to take a ring and leave the finger. But, you see, Beverly Penn... in my line... it\\'s the ripples that give the work meaning. Ideas... they can do more good than harm. And that would be the opposite of the plan, you see. It\\'s doing harm that is the very point. I might not go upstate until tomorrow. - Hmm. - No bother at all. - I\\'d be very happy to pay you. - Beautiful. Sick. - Too young to die. - I\\'m not afraid of you. I\\'ll bet that you\\'re who his miracle is for. My father has a strict policy when it comes to kidnappers. He has to save you. If you can\\'t be saved by him... job\\'s done. Mission accomplished. I love blood on the snow, Beverly Penn. Especially virginal blood. Unspoiled. Unmolested. Beverly! No! - Hold on. - Peter Lake. - Go fast! - Yes, clearly. We can\\'t outrun them forever. I know! We have to get above the city. Go north along the river. - Peter! That\\'s way too far down! - Hold on! - Hold on? - Hold on! Peter. Peter, wait! How is that even possible? I don\\'t know. This horse. We can\\'t follow them up there. - Why not? - The rules. A little dispute a couple hundred years ago. Shortsighted. Well, we almost had him. Almost is not good enough, Romeo. Do you want the job or not, Dingy? I need to see the Judge. Are you all right? All the excitement... and your condition. I\\'m perfect. Good. Head upriver. Beverly! Thank you. - Okay? - Yeah. Hello, little one. Mm. I\\'ve only known the city. It\\'s called the Lake of the Coheeries. I\\'ve been coming here since I was a little girl. My father says nothing happens here that isn\\'t supposed to. Hello. Hi. I\\'m Willa. Willa. How are you, Willa? Are you Beverly\\'s boyfriend? Let\\'s go inside. I\\'m sure Father will have something to say about the matter. Do you take wine with your meals? Sometimes. That\\'s good. We\\'ll have wine tonight. Okay. - Would claret be all right with you? - Anything. But, uh, don\\'t you pronounce it... \"claret\"? No. Claret. You pronounce the T. Just as in fillet. Fillet? I always thought it was \"fillet.\" No, it\\'s fillet. Just as in wallet. You don\\'t say \"wallet,\" do you? You say wallet. L SEE. - You know what? - Sir? You look like a crook. Who are you? What do you do? What is your relationship to Beverly? Are you aware of her special condition? What are your motivations, intentions and desires? Tell the absolute truth. Don\\'t elaborate. Stop if a neighbor, child or servant comes in. And be brief. Be brief? These are complicated questions. If you were one of my journalists, you\\'d be finished by now. God created the world in six days. Ape him. - Heh. I\\'ll try. - It\\'s unnecessary. - All right. - Unnecessary. My name is Peter Lake. You\\'re right, I\\'m a thief, and I\\'m a damn good one. I love Beverly. Our relationship goes by no name. I have no intentions. I desire her, and I am moved by love. Do you understand? How do I know that you\\'re not moved by vanity or curiosity? How do I know you\\'re not here for the money in this family? I was an orphan. Orphans don\\'t have vanity. I\\'m not sure why, but one needs parents to be vain. And the money? I wouldn\\'t take a penny from you, for a start. I would accept no favors, not even a kind word said on my behalf. And of her condition? I\\'ve never loved much before. So death... hasn\\'t been something to be avoided. But now when I think of losing her... Is it possible to love someone so completely they simply can\\'t die? No. But I\\'m a thief... as you so keenly observed. Can\\'t I steal just one life? Well, we\\'ll see about you. Does that mean I might try some of that claret now? Let\\'s both, shall we? One more thing: She sleeps in her tent on the roof. And you do not. Some locals found me while they were digging up clams. I spent a few years on the bounce from orphanage to orphanage. Just got on better on the streets, I suppose. What did you do? To live, I mean. I danced and sang in the streets for coins. Picked pockets. I lived with two girls for a while. - Two? - Two. Aren\\'t you the playboy. Ah, it wasn\\'t like that. Mostly. I was young. And then Pearly scooped me up. He said I had talent. I take it it wasn\\'t for your singing. It\\'s not working, is it? You\\'re not getting any cooler. No. Here, let me try something. Come here. Actually, this isn\\'t helping. Can you hear your heart? When the fever comes, it\\'s about the only thing I can hear. When you crack your first safe, your heart beats so loud you can\\'t hear the tumblers. You have to learn to quieten it, slow it down, so you can work between the beats. The trick to it is lists. Meaningless words... you say, as you exhale to slow down the breath. Inhale quietly... exhale and say the words until the breath is gone. - Got it? - I think so. Do you need a list? Animals are good. Colors. Saints. Castor. Pollux. Capella. Ursa Major. Ursa Minor. Polaris. Peter.. - Heh. - ... It\\'s working. Go on. Pleiades. Perseus. Cassiopeia. Hello. Those are mine. The paper too. Yeah, I figured as much. I couldn\\'t sleep. I like to draw by the moon. See, I\\'m not very good and the light helps hide it. Is it Beverly? I don\\'t know anyone else with red hair. Do you love her? With all my heart. Do you swear? I swear. Okay. Come with me. It\\'s a princess bed. I made the neighbor boys make it for her. They listen to me. Daddy told me a story about a princess who died... and a kiss that made her not dead anymore. If you kiss her here... she won\\'t die. I know it. Okay? Say okay. Okay. Okay. You can put me to bed now. Pearly Soames. I have an appointment. Hello, Pearly. Ah. Hello, Your Honor. Sir. Oh, of course. Eh... I\\'m here to request special dispensation regarding the boundaries of jurisdiction. Proceed. I\\'d like permission to travel north of the city, Your Honor. Wow, that is quite a request, Pearly, considering what happened last time. Well, you know, it was a misunderstanding. Yeah. Well, demon, let\\'s get this over with. Pearly Soames, Warden of Manhattan and the Five Boroughs... on what grounds do you make this request? I\\'ve come to believe that a human is on the verge of using his miracle... which would be a formidable advancement for the other side. - Evidence? - Presence of guardian angels, Your Honor. Both the White Dog of the East and Cecil Mature. - What else? - Well, I\\'ve had a vision. A red-haired girl I\\'ve drawn in a fugue with the blood of a virgin. Pearly, that could be anyone. Okay, Lu, I mean, he\\'s already been seen with a girl matching that exact description. Uh... She\\'s dying. And he loves her? Purely, entirely, and with all his heart. So you believe it is his miracle to save her. I do, sir. Yes, Your Honor. I do. A man\\'s destiny is often not what it seems. I understand that, sir, I do. I do. I understand that. But I... Heh. I, uh... I have a feeling about this one, you know? You trained him. Picked him up off the street. The son you never had. Embarrassing, no? Shit happens. Your Honor... I just need the permission to go north. Denied. This one is too personal. Your prohibition from the northern territories is upheld. Lucifer! I need to stop this one, now! N aw? You have no idea what \"now\" is. Now, I was flying. Now, I breathed fire and I ate them as they fled. Now, I whipped my tail and the winds trembled. Now, I am hidden in this pale shade of flesh and bone. Now, I am witness to man\\'s eternal salvation. Now, I am witness to his demise. Do not speak to me of time, demon. Its simplest ebbs and turns elude your meager understanding. Find another way! Now! Let me take you dancing. How about New Year\\'s Eve? Can you? Dance, I mean. I have done. A bit. Some. Well, I know them all. From books, anyway. It seems wonderful. So it\\'s sorted, then. I can\\'t, Peter. Is it me? Because I\\'m not a gentleman with a driver and the right clothes? You know it\\'s not that. What, then? Well, my father says that dancing will kill me. Ah. Fathers are overprotective. Coat stays on. We\\'re all to go next door for an afternoon peppermint. What is it? What\\'s wrong? It\\'s been happening all afternoon. Has something to do with the furnace. Your father\\'s been down there for an hour with the mechanic. He sent the rest of the staff to the Gamelys\\' and asked that you join them. Now, Willa, please. Go on next door, Bev. I\\'ll, uh, see if I can help them out downstairs. Miss. The little one. Miss. She\\'s jammed up. Let me take a look. We\\'re in the red already. You should go next door. What about you? This sounds like it\\'s about to blow sky-high. Go down with the ship, as it were. Yeah, it\\'s a house, not a ship. My wife made this place. She picked every stitch of furniture. Every pillow, every sconce and window frame. Wouldn\\'t do to leave it. Listen, you should go now. Winston, go, go. Now, you. The steam can\\'t come. - Are you mad? - Wait. I have a sympathy for complex systems. How things go together and come apart. Like locks. Aah! Just need to feel for the connection. That pipe\\'s too hot, avoid it, avoid it. This one\\'s blocked. Means the problem\\'s before it. It\\'s stuck. - Uh-oh. - Uh-oh? - Oops. - Oops? Am I light or heavy? Heh. Light as a feather. Good night, Peter Lake. Good night, little Willa. My father says you saved all our lives. He\\'s overstating things. It was just him and the furnace man\\'s. And yours. Yeah, mine too, I suppose. Thursday is New Year\\'s Eve. I\\'d like to go dancing. You take great risk coming to me for this. You owe me, angel. And this is me calling in my marker. You know I cannot directly intervene. Relax, flyboy. It just makes the heart beat a little faster. Someone would have to be real excited to experience any deleterious effects. You know the rules. Debts must be paid. And then ours is settled. Then we\\'re square. Yes, indeed. You\\'re a good man yourself. Well done. I\\'ve been wondering. With all these trying to go up... and you come down. Was it worth it, becoming human? Or was it an impulse buy? You must miss the wings, right? Oh, come on. You must. You look good in that suit. You... are impossibly beautiful. So are you. Stop it. Or I\\'ll melt all the snow I\\'m standing on. Give me a chance and you\\'ll melt all the snow in the world. Come on. My mother always said that it was bigger on the inside than it was on the outside. - Shall we? - Yes. You\\'re late. I\\'m sorry. If you don\\'t make love to me now, no one ever will. Well, that\\'s exactly what I\\'ll do, then. Places. What, love? Places we\\'ve been. What do you mean? Beverly? Beverly? Beverly? Beverly. Bev. No, no, no. No. Beverly. Baby. This isn\\'t right. This isn\\'t right. Beverly. Beverly. Beverly! Don\\'t leave me. Please don\\'t go. I\\'m sorry. They spotted him. Otter did. Peter Lake, I mean. He\\'s back. Where? He was at a graveyard in Queens burying some girl... then went back to Grand Central for his horse. Do they still have him? Well, that\\'s just the thing. They can\\'t lose him. - They\\'re just walking. - Just walking? Let\\'s go for a little walk ourselves. With little Peter Lake. Shh. It\\'s all right, horse. I know they\\'re coming for us. A fight will do us good. You failed. You couldn\\'t save her. Your beloved red-haired girl. Ha, ha. Was she gonna be somebody important? The president? The pope? The great-grandmother of the first man on Mars? Or was it something simpler? That she was capable of great love? The kind of love that makes the world all warm and light. And gives the others hope. The kind of love that tilts the scales. Well, it doesn\\'t matter. She\\'s dead. Cold. Dead. And already in the ground. Quit me? You don\\'t quit me, boy. I\\'ve been blackening souls... and crushing miracles for longer than I can remember. Do you ever ask yourself why the universe goes to all this trouble... to help you fulfill your destiny and then throws me in your path? Maybe it\\'s because God is just as bloodthirsty as the rest of us. Maybe he doesn\\'t like eternal benevolence and light. Maybe he just likes a good fight. I have no idea what you\\'re talking about. But I\\'ll tell you one thing: It\\'s a shame your daddy didn\\'t do a better job on your neck with that soda bottle. Is that right, little Peter Lake? Well, let\\'s see what we\\'re gonna do with you. Come on. Move! Move it! Stop right there! - Come on, Pete! - How are you, lads? - Skin that white dog alive. - No! Bring in the net! - Get him! - I want you to go. Horse, go! Hold, boys. Horse! Horse. Go. Go. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Well, well, well. Hey, pal. You looking for someone in particular? I... I don\\'t know. I can\\'t remember. I can\\'t remember anything. When true love is lost... life can bleed of all meaning. We are left blank. But the possibility of destiny remains. What we are meant for may yet be discovered. And once in a very long while... that journey to find our destiny may defeat even time itself. Who are you? Pete, here\\'s your change. I smashed into you. You did. Are you all right? Am I light or heavy? Light as a feather. I\\'m Abby. What\\'s your name? I don\\'t know. Everybody knows their name. Not me. You\\'re silly. Look. There\\'s a star. Even the stars have names. - What? - The stars. I just can\\'t remember them. Castor. Abby. Nice to meet you. Sorry. That son of a bitch. He can\\'t still be alive. - Romeo, find this man. - Cesar. Romeo was my grandfather. Cesar... drop everything else. Find this man. Boss, this is like a hundred years old. Do I, uh, strike you as a man who wouldn\\'t know that? No, sir. I didn\\'t... I\\'m sorry, sir. I didn\\'t... Remember I told you how I killed your grandfather? Sorry, sir. Find that man. Find him. We may have killed the wrong redhead. Isaac Penn, please. The woman out front said he was back here. This is the Isaac Penn Reading Room. Yeah, I mean, I\\'d like to speak with him if I could. Be a neat trick. Penn\\'s been dead 90 years. Heh. There\\'s a theater on Hudson Street called the Theater of the Coheeries. Could you, uh, tell me if you have any information on it, please? Isaac Penn donated it. Nope. I see it here... but the information on it hasn\\'t been cataloged from the microfiche. Okay, might I see them, please? These micro fish. Sure. Two forms of ID, fill this out, two-week approval period... and you can search to your heart\\'s delight. Can I just...? I mean... I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t help you. There\\'s so many regulations these days. - Hi, I\\'m Virginia Gamely. - Hi, Peter Lake. - Hi. - Hi. Do I know you from somewhere? I don\\'t think so, no. No. Although I can\\'t be sure. I\\'ve had no memory... - ... for as long as I can remember. - Oh. Maybe there was once a blow on the head, although I can\\'t find a scar. And the whole world has seemed like a deep fog that\\'s just now beginning to lift. Although not fast enough for my liking. I\\'ve become convinced... that if I could just learn what this Coheeries is... it may help jog my memory. But now they\\'re telling me I have to wait two weeks... and I have to have two forms of ID that I don\\'t have just to even get back there. But I have a growing suspicion that I may be able to get what I need faster... as soon as everybody goes home for the night. If only I knew what a micro fish looked like. You know, places like this have all sorts of security systems. Well, somehow I find myself undaunted. Well, you\\'re in luck. I work here, so I don\\'t need any approvals. Isn\\'t that right, Jack? Reporters come and go as they please, Ms. Gamely. - There you go. - I appreciate the help. I wasn\\'t having any luck anyway. What were you looking for? A cure for cancer, I suppose. So... this should go... here. And... Aw. Wait a sec. Let me see. Thought you didn\\'t even know what microfiche were. I just got a knack with machines. Try it now. Well, that\\'s not a theater. Damn. Guess it\\'s mislabeled. Coheeries isn\\'t a theater. It\\'s a town. Oh. That\\'s old man Penn. She played Brahms. Beverly. Her name was... Her name was Beverly. That\\'s... It can\\'t be. Your father? What\\'s happening here? She\\'s dead. She\\'s long gone. They\\'re all dead a hundred years. Not all of them. - Yes? - Hi. Um... My name is Virginia Gamely. Uh, I work here. - Yes? - I write the food column. - Yes? - Is she in? Do you have an appointment I\\'m not aware of? Thank you, Mr. Ambassador. I\\'m glad we could come to an understanding. I think I\\'ll have a milkshake for lunch, Marge. Do you think Dr. Levi would kill me? Chocolate with whipped cream. Ms. Penn? Willa. Little Willa. Peter Lake. It\\'s right up there. Where did you find him? I think he found me. How is this really possible? Well, in a life this long, you do see things. Things that don\\'t always add up to the world we think we know. Hmm. I\\'ve always held on to that table. Nothing special, can\\'t say why. He loved my sister terribly. She was like a bright light. How did she die? Consumption. The night she died... The night she died... I searched the sky for her. And I found her there in Orion\\'s Belt, I think. She used to say that when we finished our work on Earth... we would fly up and become stars. What work? She was 21. How could she have possibly been finished? Why am I still alive? Well, I look at you, Peter, unchanged after all these years. Maybe there\\'s something you are still meant to do. What? I have no idea. May I make you some tea? Please. Thank you for bringing me back here. I have a feeling we won\\'t see each other again, will we? It\\'s poor manners to talk back to your elders. Technically, I think I\\'m older than you. No, I have a feeling we won\\'t. Goodbye, Peter Lake. Goodbye, little Willa. I\\'m looking forward to your next recipe, young lady. I rather like pecans. I have to pick up my daughter at 3:30. So, um... I live down on 12th Street. I\\'ve got a chicken... if you like chicken. I would like that, but, um... - Well, I have a few things I need to... - Okay. - Okay. - Hey. - Take care. - Thank you. Tell the boss that we found him. How is he still alive? What are we talking about here, Lu? We\\'re talking about what we are always talking about: Stars in the sky. Miracles. - I stopped him from saving her. - Pearly. Not his miracle. Hers. What? You were so fixated on stopping him... you missed her entirely. She made him love her so much that he could not die. He was her miracle. I want to kill him, and I want him to stay dead. I want him turned into snow and scattered to the four winds. Mm. Older rules would apply. You would be fighting as a mortal. That\\'s rather extreme, don\\'t you think? I\\'ll tell you something that should chill your blood. No matter how far we tip the scales our way... no matter how many of them we turn dark... nothing seems to break their capacity for hope. They pass it back and forth like the flu at a preschool fair. We\\'re losing, Lucifer. One bright star at a time, we\\'re losing. You will have to say the words, Pearly. Right. I, Pearly Soames... Demon Enforcer of the Five Boroughs... Black Knight of the Armies of the Fallen... and faithful and willing servant to Lucifer, your good self... hereby request that the loser of the fight... between the human, Peter Lake, and myself... die the one true death. Reconsider. No. Last chance, Pearly. Granted. Pearly. Watch out for the starlight. What are you talking about, Lu? Be careful. I would hate to lose you. Why? You get used to people. Did you try the Brussels sprouts yet? I\\'m not really that hungry, Mom. Just try to eat something, baby, okay? Okay. Here you go. - Mama? - Yes, baby? Where do you think we go when we die? Come here. Hello? You said 12th Street, and you\\'re the only Gamelys on 12th Street. And I do like chicken. - You floated here? In a boat? - That\\'s what I was told. We have chocolate, strawberry... and pistachio. Pistachio. Pistachio? - She hates vanilla. - I hate vanilla. Mama. Lay her down. Hey, baby. All right. Relax. Relax, relax. Mama\\'s here. It\\'s all right. It\\'s all right, darling. Mama\\'s here. She gets seizures. She\\'ll sleep now. Abby has red hair. We have to go. Now. No. There\\'s nowhere to go. The girl in the pictures... the girl I\\'ve been drawing... it was her all along. She has cancer, Peter. Her doctors say she\\'s dying. I think I know how to save her. They said only a miracle. Me. That\\'s why I stayed alive. For her. I\\'m her miracle. This is crazy. I can save her. I know I can. We have to go. There are men coming who mean to harm me. I think they mean to harm Abby too. Trust me, please. There\\'s a horse on the roof. There is. Hello, my old friend. It\\'s been a very long time. Here. Give her to me. Come on. - You know where to go, horse. - What? Shh. Let him do the math. Okay. - How is she? - Still sleeping. Hey. Coheeries. It looks forgotten. Come on, this way. What about those, uh...? Whoever they were. Christ. I don\\'t think they can follow us up here. You don\\'t think. That\\'s reassuring. No, I\\'m fairly sure. Rules change. Little Peter wants to save someone. But I want to fight. Good to see you, Peter. In fairness, I can\\'t say the same thing about you, Pearly. Well, it seems I got my redheads mixed up. Honest mistake. I\\'ll fix it. There\\'s 20 of us. And there\\'s just the one of you. There\\'ll be no miracles tonight. And her destiny is getting skewered. Horse. I suppose you know what to do, horse. Always a coward, that White Dog! Boys. Why do you do it, Pearly? Do you even know? I know my destiny. And it\\'s high time you met yours. Off the ice! Right, then. Abby? Abby. Oh, Jesus. No. A bed of wishes made 100 years ago by a little girl who\\'s now an old woman. A bed made to save a girl with flaming red hair from dying too young. A place made for a miracle. Now, I\\'m just a mechanic, but what are we if not machines? Machines that need a little help from the universe to run. Abby. Is this why we love at all? To save? You were always the one, weren\\'t you? Please, you were always the one I was meant to save. Come back. Please come back. No. Mama? Why is everybody crying? Did I get sick and pass out again? Yes, Abby. But you\\'re better now. Why would so many things conspire to save one little girl\\'s life? But what if it wasn\\'t just Abby? What if she is no more or less special than any of us? What if we are all unique... and the universe loves us all equally? So much so that it bends over backwards across the centuries... for each and every one of us. And sometimes, we are just lucky enough to see it. No life is more important than another. And nothing has been without purpose. Nothing. What if we are all part of a great pattern that we may someday understand? And one day, when we have done what we alone are capable of doing... we get to rise up and reunite with those we have loved the most... forever embraced.'\n",

      " 'The optical flow of natural scenes is a combination of the motion of the\\nobserver and the independent motion of objects. Existing algorithms typically\\nfocus on either recovering motion and structure under the assumption of a\\npurely static world or optical flow for general unconstrained scenes. We\\ncombine these approaches in an optical flow algorithm that estimates an\\nexplicit segmentation of moving objects from appearance and physical\\nconstraints. In static regions we take advantage of strong constraints to\\njointly estimate the camera motion and the 3D structure of the scene over\\nmultiple frames. This allows us to also regularize the structure instead of the\\nmotion. Our formulation uses a Plane+Parallax framework, which works even under\\nsmall baselines, and reduces the motion estimation to a one-dimensional search\\nproblem, resulting in more accurate estimation. In moving regions the flow is\\ntreated as unconstrained, and computed with an existing optical flow method.\\nThe resulting Mostly-Rigid Flow (MR-Flow) method achieves state-of-the-art\\nresults on both the MPI-Sintel and KITTI-2015 benchmarks.'\n",

appellant\\'s application filed on 15 November 2006 be dismissed.The appellant\\'s application to the Federal Magistrates Court was for constitutional writs directed to the Refugee Review Tribunal (\"the Tribunal\") in relation to a decision handed down by the Tribunal on 26 October 2006.The decision made by the Tribunal was that the decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs not to grant a Protection (Class XA) visa (\"protection visa\") be affirmed.The appellant is a national of the People\\'s Republic of China (\"China\").She was born in 1967 in Fuqing City, Fujian Province, China.She arrived in Australia on 12 October 1998 using a Chinese passport in the name of another person.On 1 October 2004, nearly six years after she arrived in this country, the appellant was detained by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.On 30 November 2004, she applied for a protection visa.A delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs refused her application.The appellant\\'s application for review by the Tribunal was refused on 22 April 2005, but that decision was set aside by consent by the Federal Magistrates Court on 20 July 2005.A second Tribunal decision affirming the delegate\\'s decision was set aside, again by consent, by the Federal Magistrates Court.The application for review was remitted to the Tribunal a second time.It is the decision of the Tribunal on the second remitter which was the subject of the application for constitutional writs made to the Federal Magistrates Court, and the decision of that Court which is the subject of the present appeal.The appellant\\'s application for a protection visa The appellant put her claim for refugee status on a number of grounds.The Tribunal rejected all of her grounds and the Tribunal\\'s rejection of a number of grounds is not challenged by the appellant.In terms of setting out the factual background, it is sufficient for me at this point to summarise the claims made by the appellant in her application for a protection visa.In her application, the appellant stated that she was a Christian.She stated that she had been employed in a number of unskilled jobs in both China and Australia.She stated that she was married in 1987 and that she separated from her husband in 1997.She had two children, and they live with relatives in China.The appellant stated that, in 1996, she became pregnant for a third time.She was detained and forced to have a termination of the pregnancy.She also received a notice that she had to have a pregnancy prevention operation, but she ignored it.Her husband and her family wanted her to have the operation to avoid a fine which she and her family would have to pay if she did not have the operation.She moved back to her mother\\'s home.Some time later, she made an unsuccessful attempt to reconcile with her husband.The appellant stated that she encountered problems in China due to her father\\'s previous political activities.Her father was in gaol from 1967 to 1972, and, following his release, he was harassed and tormented by the authorities and members of the community.He died in 1994.The appellant stated that she had been mistreated at school and had had difficulties in obtaining employment because of her father\\'s reputation.The appellant also stated that she encountered problems because of her religion.She attended an underground Christian church.At a time at which she was not present, the authorities raided the church and arrested several members.In her application, the appellant claimed that she had been persecuted by the Chinese authorities because (1) she was a woman; (2) she had had a third pregnancy; 3) she had a \"bad\" family background; and (4) she had Christian beliefs.She also claimed that her husband and his family persecuted her because she had not given birth to a boy.The appellant claimed that she feared persecution if she returned to China.She feared that she would be detained for avoiding the one child policy and that she would be forced to have a pregnancy prevention operation.She also feared that she would be unable to find employment, and further stated that she feared harm by her husband and his family.The Tribunal\\'s decision The Tribunal\\'s decision included the above summary and a summary of the material the appellant provided to it, including the evidence she and a witness she called gave to the Tribunal.The Tribunal also referred to country information it had examined.The Tribunal then proceeded to its findings and reasons.The Tribunal first examined the appellant\\'s claim that she had a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of her religion.In that context, the Tribunal found the following: (1) The appellant attended a local house church only occasionally and because her siblings did so.If her siblings had attended a church registered with the authorities, she would have done so.(2) The appellant did not attend church in Australia for a period of about six years because she does not regard herself as a practising Christian.(3) The religious activity engaged in by the appellant in 2004, and in the period thereafter, was for the sole purpose of strengthening her claim to be a refugee and must be disregarded: Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (\" Migration Act \") s 91R(3).(4) If the appellant wished to practise Christianity on her return to China, she could do so at one of the officially recognised churches and she would not be persecuted if she did so.The Tribunal rejected the appellant\\'s claim for refugee status on the ground that she had a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of her religion, and the Tribunal\\'s conclusion with respect to that conclusion is not challenged on the appeal.The Tribunal then examined the appellant\\'s claim for refugee status based on the fact that she faced a sterilisation operation and a large fine if she returned to China.I will need to come back to the Tribunal\\'s reasoning on this issue because it lies at the heart of the appeal.It is sufficient to say at this point that the Tribunal rejected the appellant\\'s claim on this basis because the risk of harm arises from \"a non-discriminatory penalty for contravention of a law of general application\".The Tribunal then turned to consider whether the appellant\\'s treatment following her third pregnancy, and the termination thereof, may have been influenced by a number of factors involving discrimination, which may have led to her being treated unduly harshly.The Tribunal said: \"[t]he relevant Convention reasons which arise on the evidence appear to be her religion and/or her membership of a particular social group, being her family, for the reason of her father\\'s political opinion.\" The Tribunal again examined the appellant\\'s religious activities, and concluded that the authorities had no adverse interest in the appellant because of them.As I have said, there is no challenge on the appeal to the Tribunal\\'s conclusions with respect to the appellant\\'s religious activities.The Tribunal then considered the appellant\\'s claim that she had a well-founded fear of persecution due to her father\\'s political opinion.The Tribunal made the following findings: (1) There was no evidence that any person referred to her late father or his history during the period in which she was having problems with family planning officers.(2) The appellant\\'s father faced no discrimination because of his background for the final five or so years of his life, that is, since the late 1980s.(3) The appellant did not claim to face any discrimination as an adult because of her family background, and the fact that she did not was consistent with evidence from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.There is no challenge on the appeal to the Tribunal\\'s conclusions with respect to the previous political activities of the appellant\\'s father.The Tribunal examined the appellant\\'s claim that she had a well-founded fear of persecution because the Chinese authorities might know of her application for a protection visa.The Tribunal said that there was no evidence the authorities would come to know of that fact, and there was no evidence the appellant might face persecution for a Convention reason for making such an application.There is no challenge on the appeal to these conclusions.The Tribunal rejected any suggestion that the appellant faced a risk of harm from her husband, and it said that even if her husband\\'s family tried to harm her it could not be satisfied that \"this treatment might amount to persecution, nor that there might be a Convention reason for it\".The Tribunal also rejected any suggestion that the circumstances surrounding the death of the appellant\\'s sister supported the conclusion that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of her religion.There is no challenge on the appeal to these conclusions.The issues which are raised on the appeal centre on the Tribunal\\'s conclusion that the prospect of forced sterilisation and a large fine did not establish the appellant\\'s claim to refugee status.In this regard, it is important to note the following findings of fact made by the Tribunal.(1) The appellant gave birth to two daughters, and the birth of her second daughter was not in breach of the then valid local family planning regulations.(2) In 1997, the appellant fell pregnant a third time under pressure from her husband to have a son.(3) The appellant was forced by family planning authorities to have her third pregnancy terminated.Forced terminations were taking place at the time and there was no evidence that the termination was anything other than the enforcement of family planning regulations as they were interpreted at the time, or that it was done to her for any of the reasons set out in the Convention.(4) At or after the termination of her third pregnancy, the appellant was ordered to undergo a sterilisation operation and/or pay a large fine.The appellant faces a risk, which is not remote, that these penalties will be enforced if she returns to China.(5) The Tribunal found that forcible sterilisation, whether accompanied by a large fine or not, may amount to persecution if imposed for a Convention reason.The effect of the Tribunal\\'s findings is that it was satisfied that the appellant had a well-founded fear of serious harm if returned to China.(6) The Tribunal appears to have found that the order that she undergo a sterilisation operation was the result of the application of a law of general application.(7) The second of the appellant\\'s daughters remains unregistered and that has come about as a result either \"of a failure by anyone to argue that case with the authorities or may be a result of the outstanding debt\".The Tribunal referred to what it said was well established, namely, that enforcement of a generally applicable law does not ordinarily constitute persecution for the purposes of the Convention, for the reason that enforcement of such a law does not ordinarily constitute discrimination.The Tribunal acknowledged that Convention protection may be attracted if laws of general application are selectively enforced, \"in that the motivation for prosecution or punishment for an ordinary offence can be found in a Convention ground, or the punishment is unduly harsh for a Convention reason\".The Tribunal said that it was not satisfied that the motivation for the initial imposition of a fine and enforced sterilisation on the appellant can be found in a Convention ground.The Tribunal concluded that, in forcing the appellant to have her pregnancy terminated, in ordering her to have sterilisation, and in sending the appellant and her husband a bill, the authorities were enforcing in a non-discriminatory way a law, which, although harsh, was a law of general application.The Tribunal noted that the fine appeared to be higher than that required by law, but was not satisfied that that was for a discriminatory reason.The Tribunal referred to the fact that the appellant\\'s second daughter is unregistered.It considered that the denial of registration was contrary to China\\'s law, and, as I have said, was due to the failure of anyone to argue the case with the authorities, or may be the result of the outstanding fine.In any event, as the appellant was not persecuted for a Convention reason before she left China, the Tribunal was not satisfied that the continuing denial of registration of one of her daughters pointed to any change in the official perception of her.The Tribunal then turned to express its conclusions as to the future.It said:  \"I have accepted that [the appellant] may be at risk still of sterilisation and/or may have to pay the outstanding fine.However, for the reasons set out above I am satisfied that this arises from a non-discriminatory penalty for contravention of a law of general application.\"  The application for constitutional writs made to the Federal Magistrates Court The application for constitutional writs made to the Federal Magistrates Court by the appellant was put on one ground, and that was an alleged failure by the Tribunal to comply with s 424A of the Migration Act .The appellant appeared in person before the Federal Magistrates Court and was unsuccessful.At the first hearing of the appeal before me, the appellant was not represented.After some delay, the appellant came to be represented pro bono by Kah Lawyers and Mr L J Karp of counsel.The Court is grateful for the assistance provided to it by that firm and by Mr Karp.The appellant\\'s submissions, and indeed those of the first respondent, were concise and to the point.The grounds raised in the original notice of appeal were abandoned and new grounds were formulated in a Further Amended Notice of Appeal.Leave to file and serve the Further Amended Notice of Appeal was not opposed by the first respondent and was granted.That document did not in any way suggest that the Tribunal had failed to comply with s 424A of the Migration Act .The appellant\\'s mental condition is such that I appointed a tutor for her under O 43 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules .Grounds of appeal There are three grounds of appeal in the Further Amended Notice of Appeal.First, it is alleged that the Court below erred in failing to find that the Tribunal failed to consider a case advanced on behalf of the appellant, namely, that she feared persecution for her membership of a particular social group comprised of the parents of \"black children\".Secondly, it is alleged that the Court below erred in failing to find that the Tribunal erred in failing to consider whether the appellant would face a well-founded fear of being forcibly sterilised for the reason of her membership of a particular social group comprised of women who had more than one child and had experienced a forced abortion.Thirdly, it is alleged that the Court below erred in failing to find that the Tribunal erred in concluding that the well-founded fear of the risk of forcible sterilisation arose pursuant to the non-discriminatory enforcement of a law of general application where there was no evidence of a law which required forced sterilisation of parents who had infringed, or may infringe, the one child policy, and any law which did exist was not one of general application.Furthermore, the Tribunal failed to consider whether any law authorising forcible sterilisation was appropriate and adapted to achieving a legitimate object of the society.The appeal raises issues as to the principles governing the ascertainment of a particular social group , the applicable principles where it is said that alleged serious harm results from the application of a law of general application and that therefore there is no discrimination, the Tribunal\\'s obligation to deal with all claims advanced by an applicant and the circumstances in which an error of fact constituted by a finding for which there is no evidence amounts to a jurisdictional error.Relevant principles The following is a statement of the principles which are relevant to the issues raised by this appeal.Section 65(1) of the Migration Act provides that if the Minister is satisfied that the criteria for a visa are satisfied then he or she is to grant the visa.In the case of a protection visa, one of the criteria is that the applicant has refugee status under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol.These two terms are defined in s 5.For present purposes, that part of the criterion for acquiring refugee status which is relevant appears in Art 1A(2) and provides that a refugee is any person who:  \"... owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion , is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.\" (Emphasis added.)  Each element of this part of the definition of a refugee has been the subject of extensive judicial consideration.Furthermore, some of the elements are affected by sections of the Migration Act .For example, s 91R provides a statement of the necessary Convention nexus and of persecution.The reason or reasons must be the essential and significant reason or the essential and significant reasons for the persecution.The persecution must involve serious harm to the person, and systematic and discriminatory conduct.Without limiting the definition of serious harm, s 91R(2) provides a list of instances of serious harm.Section 91S excludes from the notion of a fear of being persecuted certain circumstances where the Convention reason is said to be membership of a particular social group consisting of the applicant\\'s family.For the purposes of this case, it is unnecessary to set out the details.An applicant for a protection visa may rely on more than one Convention reason, either in the alternative, or cumulatively.Clearly, there must be a causative link between the well-founded fear of persecution and the Convention reason.This must be so, having regard to the concept of persecution, including the statutory requirement that the persecution involve conduct which is discriminatory, and the use of the words \"for reasons of\" in the definition of a refugee.Where an applicant claims a well-founded fear of persecution because of membership of a particular social group then, in the ordinary case, the first question is whether the alleged group is a particular social group within the definition.That question involves, at least in part, a question of law.The next question is one of fact and it is whether the applicant is a member of the group.The questions thereafter are whether the applicant has a fear of persecution, whether that fear is well-founded and whether it is for a Convention reason (see Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 77 ALJR 1088 ; 197 ALR 389 (\" Dranichnikov \") at 1092; 394 [26] per Gummow and Callinan JJ (with whom Hayne J agreed)).Particular problems have arisen in cases where the applicant claims that he or she is a member of a particular social group and fears serious harm, but the claim is made that there is no pre-existing social group and that the serious harm claimed arises from the application of a law of general application.I was taken in some detail to three decisions of the High Court and one decision of a single judge of this Court, and it is to those decisions that I now turn.In Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225 (\" Applicant A \"), a husband and wife, who were nationals of China, arrived in Australia and shortly thereafter the wife gave birth to a son.They claimed refugee status by virtue of the fact that they were the parents of one child and did not accept China\\'s one child policy, which included, if necessary, enforcement by sterilisation.They claimed that they had a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to China.By a majority of 3:2, the High Court decided that they were not entitled to refugee status.Dawson J said that a particular social group for the purposes of the definition of refugee could not be defined by the persecution the members of the group feared.His Honour considered the meaning of the term \"particular social group\" and said (at 241):  \"A particular social group, therefore, is a collection of persons who share a certain characteristic or element which unites them and enables them to be set apart from society at large.That is to say, not only must such persons exhibit some common element; the element must unite them, making those who share it a cognisable group within their society.\" (Citation omitted.) His Honour considered the relationship between the concept of a particular social group and a policy applied generally and said (at 243):  \"Rather, the persecution is carried out in the enforcement of a policy which applies generally.The persecution feared by the appellants is a result of the fact that, by their actions, they have brought themselves within its terms.The only recognisable group to which they can sensibly be said to belong is the group comprising those who fear persecution pursuant to the one child policy.For the reasons I have given, that cannot be regarded as a particular social group for the purposes of the Convention.\"  McHugh J discussed the concept of persecution and the circumstances in which conduct or action under a general law or a law of general application may constitute persecution.His Honour said (at 258-259):  \"Conduct will not constitute persecution, however, if it is appropriate and adapted to achieving some legitimate object of the country of the refugee.A legitimate object will ordinarily be an object whose pursuit is required in order to protect or promote the general welfare of the State and its citizens.The enforcement of a generally applicable criminal law does not ordinarily constitute persecution.Nor is the enforcement of laws designed to protect the general welfare of the State ordinarily persecutory even though the laws may place additional burdens on the members of a particular race, religion or nationality or social group.Thus, a law providing for the detention of the members of a particular race engaged in a civil war may not amount to persecution even though that law affects only members of that race.  However, where a racial, religious, national group or the holder of a particular political opinion is the subject of sanctions that do not apply generally in the State, it is more likely than not that the application of the sanction is discriminatory and persecutory.It is therefore inherently suspect and requires close scrutiny.In cases coming within the categories of race, religion and nationality, decision-makers should ordinarily have little difficulty in determining whether a sanction constitutes persecution of persons in the relevant category.Only in exceptional cases is it likely that a sanction aimed at persons for reasons of race, religion or nationality will be an appropriate means for achieving a legitimate government object and not amount to persecution.\"  (Citations omitted.)  His Honour made the point (at 264) that, although persecutory conduct cannot define a social group, conduct of the persecutors may over time (perhaps over a short period of time) create a particular social group.Gummow J\\'s reasons were to the same effect as those of McHugh J.His Honour said (at 286):  \"With McHugh J, I conclude that the RRT made a finding that the relevant group comprised \\'those who, having only one child, either do not accept the limitations placed on them or who are coerced or forced into being sterilised\\'.As to those who are so coerced or forced, the RRT erred in law by defining membership of the group by reference to acts giving rise to the well-founded fear of persecution.As to those persons having one child who \\'do not accept the limitations placed upon them\\', they were, at best, merely a group for demographic purposes.\"  In Chen Shi Hai v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] HCA 19 ; (2000) 201 CLR 293 (\" Chen \"), the High Court held that an applicant born in breach of China\\'s one child policy who contended that he was a member of a social group called \"black children\", and who contended that he would suffer legal, social and economic disadvantages if returned to China, could form part of a particular social group for the purposes of the definition of a refugee.Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ delivered joint reasons (\"joint reasons\") and their Honours made the point (at 301 [19]) that the fact that there is said to be a law of general application is more directly relevant to the question of persecution than to the question whether a person is a member of a particular social group.As to the latter question, their Honours said in the joint reasons:  \"The question whether \\'black children\\' can constitute a social group for the purposes of the Convention arises in a context quite different from that involved in Applicant A .That case was concerned with persons who feared the imposition of sanctions upon them in the event that they contravened China\\'s \\'one-child policy\\'.In this case, the question is whether children, who did not contravene that policy but were born in contravention of it, can constitute a group of that kind.To put the matter in that way indicates that the group constituted by children born in those circumstances is defined other than by reference to the discriminatory treatment or persecution that they fear.And so much was recognised by the Tribunal in its finding that a \\'child is a \"black child\" irrespective of what persecution may or may not befall him or her\\'.\"  As to the issue of persecution and the reasons for it, their Honours considered when discriminatory conduct may or may not fall within the terms of the definition of a refugee.Their Honours said (at 302-303 [26], [27], [29]):  \"The need for different analysis depending on the reason assigned for the discriminatory conduct in question may be illustrated, in the first instance, by reference to race, religion and nationality.If persons of a particular race, religion or nationality are treated differently from other members of society, that, of itself, may justify the conclusion that they are treated differently by reason of their race, religion or nationality.That is because, ordinarily, race, religion and nationality do not provide a reason for treating people differently.  The position is somewhat more complex when persecution is said to be for reasons of membership of a particular social group or political opinion.There may be groups --- for example, terrorist groups --- which warrant different treatment to protect society.So, too, it may be necessary for the protection of society to treat persons who hold certain political views --- for example, those who advocate violence or terrorism --- differently from other members of society.  ...   Whether the different treatment of different individuals or groups is appropriate and adapted to achieving some legitimate government object depends on the different treatment involved and, ultimately, whether it offends the standards of civil societies which seek to meet the calls of common humanity.\"  In Applicant S v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 25 ; (2004) 217 CLR 387 (\" Applicant S \"), the High Court held that a young Afghan man who had a well-founded fear of being forcibly conscripted to fight for the Taliban could fall within the definition of a refugee.It was not necessary that society perceive young able-bodied men as comprising a particular social group in order to conclude that they were a particular social group within the definition of a refugee.It is sufficient if they are cognisable within the community as a particular social group.Such conclusions are clearly objective, although, that is not to say that subjective perceptions within the community may not be relevant.Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ said (at 400-401 [36]):  \"Therefore, the determination of whether a group falls within the definition of \\'particular social group\\' in Art 1A(2) of the Convention can be summarised as follows.First, the group must be identifiable by a characteristic or attribute common to all members of the group.Secondly, the characteristic or attribute common to all members of the group cannot be the shared fear of persecution.Thirdly, the possession of that characteristic or attribute must distinguish the group from society at large.Borrowing the language of Dawson J in Applicant A , a group that fulfils the first two propositions, but not the third, is merely a \\'social group\\' and not a \\'particular social group\\'.As this Court has repeatedly emphasised, identifying accurately the \\'particular social group\\' alleged is vital for the accurate application of the applicable law to the case in hand.\"  (Citations omitted.) The Court rejected a submission that there can only be persecution if enmity or malignity is present (at 401 [38]).The Court also addressed a submission that there was no persecution where the foreseeable risk of harm arose from the application of a law of general application.Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ said (at 402-403 [42]-[44]):  \"A law of general application is capable of being implemented or enforced in a discriminatory manner.  The criteria for the determination of whether a law or policy that results in discriminatory treatment actually amounts to persecution were articulated by McHugh J in Applicant A .His Honour said that the question of whether the discriminatory treatment of persons of a particular race, religion, nationality or political persuasion or who are members of a particular social group constitutes persecution for that reason ultimately depends on whether that treatment is \\'appropriate and adapted to achieving some legitimate object of the country [concerned]\\'.These criteria were accepted in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Chen .As a matter of law to be applied in Australia, they are to be taken as settled.This is what underlay the Court\\'s decision in Israelian .Namely, that enforcement of the law of general application in that particular case was appropriate and adapted to achieving a legitimate national objective.  In Applicant A , McHugh J went on to say that a legitimate object will ordinarily be an object the pursuit of which is required in order to protect or promote the general welfare of the State and its citizens.His Honour gave the examples that (i) enforcement of a generally applicable criminal law does not ordinarily constitute persecution; and (ii) nor is the enforcement of laws designed to protect the general welfare of the State ordinarily persecutory.Whilst the implementation of these laws may place additional burdens on the members of a particular race, religion or nationality, or social group, the legitimacy of the objects, and the apparent proportionality of the means employed to achieve those objects, are such that the implementation of these laws is not persecutory. (Citations omitted.) The Court concluded that, by the application of the correct principles, the Tribunal correctly would have concluded the Taliban was not pursuing a \"legitimate national objective\" spoken of in Chen because, by international standards, the Taliban was a ruthless and despotic political body, founded on extremist religious tenets, and this affected the legitimacy of the object of protecting the nation.In any event, even if the object was a legitimate national objective, it was not appropriate and adapted (in the sense of being proportionate) in the means used to achieve that objective because the policy of conscription was implemented in a random and arbitrary manner (see at 404 [47]-[49]).The appellant in the present case relied heavily on the decision of Merkel J in VTAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 927 ; (2004) 81 ALD 332 , and it is necessary to consider that decision.There were three applicants for protection visas in that case: a Chinese couple and their third child, who was born in Australia.The applicants claimed a well-founded fear of persecution as a result of the contravention of China\\'s one child policy.The harm feared by the parents was forced sterilisation of the applicant mother, a substantial financial penalty which they could not pay and limitations on employment opportunities.In the case of the child, the fear was that, as a black child, he would face significant discrimination and disadvantage.For present purposes, it is necessary to discuss the reasons only in so far as they deal with the claim of the applicant parents.The Tribunal found that the parents were not members of a particular social group because the harm suffered or feared was the sole defining characteristic of the group.It found that the child was a member of a social group, but that he would not suffer persecution as a black child.It found that China\\'s family planning laws were not discriminatory because they applied to all citizens equally, and are directed at a legitimate purpose, namely, limiting population growth.It further found that the financial burden on the parents was serious, but was not persecution within the Convention or s 91R of the Act.Merkel J held that, as far as the parents\\' claim was concerned, the Tribunal had committed a jurisdictional error.It had failed to consider the correct question in determining whether the parents were members of a particular social group.The correct test was (at 345 [32]):  \"...whether, over time, the singling out of parents of \\'black children\\' for discriminatory treatment under China\\'s family planning laws might have been absorbed into the social consciousness of the community with the consequence that a combination of legal and social factors (or norms) prevalent in the community indicated that such parents form a social group distinguishable from the rest of the community: cf Applicant S at ALR 251; ALD 550 [31].\"  As far as the question of whether the parents\\' claim was foreclosed by a finding that any harm resulted from no more than the application of laws of general application, his Honour referred to evidence that the one child laws did operate or impact in a discriminatory way on certain groups, and that, on a remitter, the Tribunal would be required to consider whether there was a real chance of that occurring in relation to the applicant parents.Independently of that point, the Tribunal would be required to consider whether China\\'s general family planning laws were appropriately adapted to meet the varying situations of parents who have more than one child.After quoting a passage from the reasons of Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ in Applicant S , Merkel J said (at 347 [41]):  \"The RRT did not enquire whether the harm feared by the applicant parents was appropriate and adapted to achieving the legitimate object of population control.That issue is to be determined by reference to \\'the standards of civil societies which seek to meet the calls of common humanity\\': see Chen at CLR 303; ALR 560 ; ALD 328 [29].As was explained in Chen , visiting the \\'sins\\' (if they be that) of the parents on the child can be persecutory of the child.Similarly, there are many instances where the view may be taken that the birth of a second child may not have come about as a result of any \\'sin\\' on the part of the mother.The birth of twins, or a child born as a result of a rape, or even failed contraception, are examples.A law of general application mandating the imposition of severe penalties on the mother irrespective of her personal circumstances may be regarded as a measure that, according to the standards of civil societies, is not appropriately adapted to achieving a legitimate object.\"  In the ordinary case, the Tribunal must consider the applicant\\'s case by reference to the particular social group articulated by him or her.In Dranichnikov , the appellant claimed that he had a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of membership of a particular social group, being Russian businessmen who publicly criticised law enforcement authorities for failing to take action against crimes or criminals.The appellant submitted that the Tribunal erred because it failed to consider his claim to refugee status by reference to that particular social group and only considered it by reference to the group of Russian businessmen.The appellant sought from the High Court special leave to appeal and relief under s 75(v) of the Constitution .The Court granted leave and relief under s 75(v).Gummow and Callinan JJ (with whom Hayne J agreed) considered that a failure by the Tribunal to respond to a substantial, clearly articulated argument relying upon established facts was a failure to accord natural justice to the appellant (which was not a statutory ground of judicial review by reason of the then provisions of the Migration Act ) and was a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction.As cited above, their Honours said (at 1092; 394 [26]):  \"At the outset it should be pointed out that the task of the Tribunal involves a number of steps.First the Tribunal needs to determine whether the group or class to which an applicant claims to belong is capable of constituting a social group for the purposes of the Convention.That determination in part at least involves a question of law.If that question is answered affirmatively, the next question, one of fact, is whether the applicant is a member of that class.There then follow the questions whether the applicant has a fear, whether the fear is well founded, and if it is, whether it is for a Convention reason.\"  (Citation omitted.) The Tribunal had failed to decide the first question; it, in fact, had decided another question.Accordingly, it had failed to exercise jurisdiction.(See also at 1101; 407 [89] per Kirby J; at 1102; 408 [95] per Hayne J; Gleeson CJ dissented, but on the ground that, in fact, the Tribunal had not misunderstood the applicant\\'s case.) The Full Court of this Court has held that a similar result may follow where the Tribunal fails to consider a claim put forward in the material before the Tribunal, even though the claim is not expressly articulated in the oral submissions and evidence at the hearing: Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1802 ; (2001) 194 ALR 244 at 248 [13] - [14] per Merkel J; at 259 [41]-[42] per Allsop J; at 245 [1] per Spender J.The Full Court of this Court has also emphasised that, for the principle to be engaged, the claim must be one which emerges clearly from the materials before the Tribunal: NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1 at 22 [68] .Notwithstanding these principles, it is not necessarily an error for the Tribunal not to begin with (or even to deal with) the question of whether there is a particular social group.The relevant part of the definition of refugee consists of a number of elements and, although they each form part of a compound conception (see Applicant A at 242 per Dawson J; at 256 per McHugh J; Chen at 299 per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ), failure to comply with one is sufficient to defeat the claim.If the serious harm results from the application of a law of general application and there is no discrimination and therefore no persecution, the claim must fail: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Israelian [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at 354-355 [93] - [97] per McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ.Finally, I address the principles as to whether an error of fact on an important matter constituted by a finding of fact for which there is no evidence may amount to a jurisdictional error.In this context, I am assuming the fact is not a jurisdictional fact.A decision-maker who makes a finding of ultimate fact for which there is no evidence commits an error of law: Sinclair v Mining Warden at Maryborough [1975] HCA 17 ; (1975) 132 CLR 473.Not all errors of law are jurisdictional errors and therefore outside the reach of the privative clause in s 474(1) of the Migration Act : Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 76 ALJR 966 ; 190 ALR 601.An error constituted by making a finding of fact for which there is no evidence could indicate that the decision-maker applied the wrong legal test, or failed to apply the correct legal test, or took into account irrelevant considerations or failed to take into account relevant considerations and, in those circumstances, the error would constitute a jurisdictional error: Craig v The State of South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 176-180; Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth of Australia (2003) 211 CLR 476.In SFGB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 231 ; (2003) 77 ALD 402 (\" SFGB \"), the Full Court of this Court suggested that an error consisting of the making of a finding of fact for which there is no evidence may well constitute a jurisdictional error, even if it cannot also be concluded that the decision-maker applied an incorrect test or failed to apply the correct test or took into account irrelevant considerations or failed to take into account relevant considerations.The Court said (at 407 [19]-[20]):  \"This argument, if it were made out, would be sufficient to establish that the tribunal had made a \\'jurisdictional error\\' so as to found jurisdiction in this court to intervene.If the tribunal makes a finding and that finding is a critical step in its ultimate conclusion and there is no evidence to support that finding then this may well constitute a jurisdictional error: Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 355---7 [1990] HCA 33 ; ; 94 ALR 11 at 37---8 [1990] HCA 33 ; ; 21 ALD 1 at 23---4.If the decision of the tribunal was \\' Wednesbury \\' unreasonableness or if the material on which the tribunal relied was so inadequate that the only inference was that the tribunal applied the wrong test or was not, in reality, satisfied in respect of the correct test, then there would also be jurisdictional error: see Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 198 ALR 59 at 62, 67, 76, 90---91 [2003] HCA 30 ; ; 73 ALD 1 at 4, 8---9, 18, 31---3.( S20 ).  On the other hand, if there is sufficient evidence or other information before the tribunal on which it could reach the conclusion it did then it is for the tribunal to determine what weight it gives to that evidence.Indeed, unless the relevant fact can be identified as a \"jurisdictional fact\", there is no error of law, let alone a jurisdictional error, in the tribunal making a wrong finding of fact: Attorney-General (NSW) v Quin (1990) 170 CLR 1 at 35---6; 93 ALR 1 at 24---5.\"  The principle which I have identified by reference to the reasons of the Full Court has been applied by single judges of this Court: see, for example, SZDTZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1824 ; SZDFZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 390 ; (2008) 168 FCR 1 ; SZKMX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 856.The first respondent submitted that the principle identified in [53] above is inconsistent with the decision of the High Court in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 [2003] HCA 30 ; (2003) 77 ALJR 1165 ; 198 ALR 59.I have examined that decision carefully and I do not think there is anything in the decision which is inconsistent with the principle identified by the Full Court.Leaving aside the question of whether, sitting as a single judge exercising the appellate jurisdiction of this Court, I could or should decline to follow a decision of the Full Court, I am not persuaded that the decision is clearly wrong and I think I should follow the principle identified by the Full Court.Issues on the appeal In this case, the appellant through her solicitors made a written submission to the Tribunal that she is a member of a particular group of people, namely, Chinese parents of black children and that the punishments she has suffered and might suffer are not appropriate and adapted to achieving a legitimate end.The appellant submitted that her breach of the one child policy had not come about as the result of any \"sin\" on her part, bearing in mind the pressures imposed by Chinese society to bear a male child.She submitted that she suffers and continues to suffer serious psychological harm as a result of the persecution of her black child.In this case, the Tribunal did not approach the matter by determining whether there was a particular social group of the type identified by the appellant, or, indeed, any other particular social group which might be reasonably arguable on the facts.The Tribunal approached the matter by considering whether the serious harm which the appellant feared, and which the Tribunal found, arose, or resulted from, the application of a law of general application.As I have said (at [50]), that is not necessarily an error.However, the appellant submitted that the Tribunal made an error in determining that an order requiring a sterilisation operation arose, or resulted from, the application of a law of general application.That submission is correct.I accept the first respondent\\'s submission that there are limitations on the Tribunal\\'s ability to determine with precision the provisions of China\\'s family planning laws and that there would be a temptation to think, as the order that the appellant undergo a sterilisation operation followed \"hard on the heels\" of the termination of the appellant\\'s third pregnancy, therefore it was part of a law of general application.However, when regard is had to the evidence the Tribunal referred to in relation to this question, it seems to me that there was no evidence that sterilisation was part of a law of general application.In fact, the evidence was to the contrary.In determining the parameters of China\\'s population policy, the Tribunal relied on evidence from various sources.It referred to the one child policy launched by the Chinese Government in 1979.It referred to the fact that there is no national legislation, and family planning policy is left to provinces and municipalities to implement, and each province has drafted its own regulations in support of the policy.The Tribunal noted sources indicating that family planning policy varied widely across China and that penalties for contravening the one child policy can also vary across regions.The Tribunal noted a source suggesting that, in general, Fujian had one of the least coercive family planning regimes in China and that \"some local governments enforce family planning rules more vigorously than others\".This has created \"a patchwork of different rules and enforcement across the province\".In dealing with coercive measures, the Tribunal referred to the following: (1) A statement by the United States of America Department of State in 1999; (2) A Canadian report dated 2000; (3) Reports prepared by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 2004; (4) A news article, another Canadian report and other reports of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.These sources suggested that government policy forbade forced sterilisations, although they occurred from time to time.They tended to result from the actions of overzealous officials and they were becoming rarer.It seems to me that the finding that sterilisation was part of a penalty for the contravention of a law of general application was in error and the error was that there was no evidence to support the finding.The error was an error of law and, following the Full Court\\'s decision in SFGB , a jurisdictional error.The finding was a critical step in the Tribunal\\'s ultimate conclusion.It seems to me that it would be open to the Tribunal to conclude that the appellant belonged to a particular social group, being those women who became pregnant in contravention of China\\'s family planning laws and who have been required to have that pregnancy terminated.The Tribunal found the appellant had a well-founded fear of serious harm (that is, forced sterilisation) and it seems to me that it would be open to it to conclude that the harm was for reasons of her membership of the social group and not for the reason of the application of a law of general application.In those circumstances, the appeal must be allowed and the matter remitted to the Tribunal.Conclusion The orders of the Court are as follows: 1.The appeal be allowed.The orders of the Federal Magistrates Court made on 21 February 2008 be set aside and in lieu of those orders there be orders that: (a) a writ of certiorari issue quashing the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal handed down on 26 October 2006 (RRT Case Number 060341569); and (b) a writ of mandamus issue directed to the Refugee Review Tribunal requiring it to hear and determine the appellant\\'s application for review according to law.I will hear the parties as to any other orders.I certify that the preceding sixty-six (66) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Besanko.Associate:   Dated: 6 April 2009  Counsel for the Appellant: The Appellant appeared in person (29 May 2008)Ms A J Ye appeared as McKenzie friend (27 and 28 August 2008)Mr L J Karp (10 October 2008) (Pro Bono)   Solicitor for the Appellant: Kah Lawyers (10 October 2008) (Pro Bono)   Counsel for the Respondents: Mr G R Kennett   Solicitor for the Respondents: Australian Government Solicitor  Date of Hearing: 29 May, 27 and 28 August, and 10 October 2008   Date of Judgment: 6 April 2009    AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback  URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2009/315.html   '\n",
      " 'When the sun starts to dip in the Hollywood Hills the light often takes on the saturated loveliness of color by Technicolor. The homes of the movie stars in the late 1930s, said to be fabulous, were. And the cocktails and dinner gatherings saw the film colonies crème de la crème draining highballs , exchanging rumors, making deals and trading gossip. No A-list affair was complete without the presence of Phil Stern, one of the towns most high powered agents and his lovely wife, Karen. Brilliant and dynamic, Stern could invariably be found holding court. I saw Paul Muni on stage in New York and I was the first one to determine that he could do films. I pegged it. I saw him long before anyone else knew he would be a film actor. - You had the idea? - I knew that he could make the transition. What was his quality? Watch the spilling please. It\\'s a good party. Excuse me. - A telephone call, Mr. Stern. - For me? I better take this. I\\'m expecting a call from Ginger Rogers. I told her I could be reached here. She\\'s not happy with her representation, so who knows? Phil Stern here. Phil, it\\'s Rose. Rose? Your sister! How did you find me here? Your housekeeper gave me the number. What\\'s wrong? Bobby quit Marty\\'s jewelry business. - And he\\'s coming to Hollywood. I was hoping you could find something for him in your agency. Who? Bobby. My son. Your nephew. Phil. We\\'re talking to Warner Brothers for next summer if they get the rights to the book. - And Bette Davis would be perfect. If they get the rights to the book, we\\'ll talk. Until that happens, trying to make that deal is like trying to light a wet match. - Let me just get off this call. - Get off the phone, we\\'ll sit down. - Hello? Yes? - He does not know a soul out there. So what the hell is he coming out here for? I mean, I don\\'t know what I can do for him, meanwhile this call is costing you a fortune. Look... I gotta go. Ginger Rogers is trying to get in touch with me. Two weeks later, a cab from the train station pulls up in Hollywood at the Ali Baba Motel. And emerging from it was a young man hoping to make a life for himself. This was Robert Jacob Dorfman. Bobby Dorfman, from the Bronx, away from home for the first time. The son of the poor jeweler, Marty Dorfman, and his beleaguered wife, Rose. His parents bickered on all subjects, particularly Phil Stern. He\\'s not a Jewish man... And what are you? You\\'re no example. You don\\'t prey, you don\\'t fast... and you don\\'t have a traditional Jewish head. You\\'re stupid! Then there was the middle sister Evelyn, the school teacher... married to Leonard, the intellectual, the professor, the Communist. \"Religion is the opium of the people.\" A ponderer of big questions. A mench, A match made in heaven for Evelyn. Finally there was the eldest brother, Ben. Simply put, Ben was a gangster. Bobby loved his brother and chose to see Ben\\'s livelihood as the restaurant supply business. But while Ben serviced bars and nightclubs... there was a darker aspect to his life. And so, on a sun drenched day on Wilshire Boulevard, Bobby Dorfman approaches the office of his Uncle Phil Stern. Hi, I\\'m here to see Phil Stern. - You have an appointment? - I do... I\\'m Bobby Dorfman, his nephew. He is actually in conference at the moment. Why don\\'t you have a seat. Mr Dorfman? - Yes? - Mr Stern will not be available today. There\\'s a little bit of a crisis that\\'s come up. Can you come back Friday? Er, that\\'s three days away. Yes, the 19th. Thank you. Always to Sid I\\'m sorry, Mr Stern had to leave for Acapulco. He said to tell you he had promised the trip to his wife for her birthday. Christ, he went from Mexico to Chicago on business I\\'m here 3 weeks, I can\\'t get near him... It\\'s M.G.M., it\\'s Ginger Rogers, it\\'s Ronald Coleman... That\\'s why Phil Stern is a big man. He\\'ll be back so make the best of it. Here, your brother, he came over for potato pancakes. Take the phone. Hey pal, you bored already? I was there for 3 weeks, that\\'s why I never go back. It\\'s sunny and warm but it\\'s not New York. I don\\'t know anybody here. here they call danish \"sweet rolls\" and they give you coffee before you eat... the minute you sit down, even before the orange juice. Let me give you some phone numbers. Ok hang on... Toni White, Klondike 0079. She knows lots of girls. I know you\\'re shy. You don\\'t have to make conversation... Just pay em\\' $20 bucks. She knows some beauts. Hey, I\\'m not paying for it. There\\'s nothing sexy about a commercial transaction. You\\'re right kid, its the worst but some nights it\\'s the only game in town. Good bye. He\\'s a good kid, he\\'ll do ok. Meanwhile her phoney brother is giving him the runaround. He is busy! You don\\'t know what is is to be busy! The man eats with Fred Astaire and Gary Cooper. I\\'m impressed. Here. Good pancakes. Buy yourself a hat. What\\'s this? 1500$ ? So go to Florida a few days. I don\\'t want this money if it came from anything fishy. My partner and I might buy a nightclub. Would it make you feel better if I was in the nightclub business? As long as it\\'s all above board. - When will you know? - We have to see if the owner will sell. We\\'re trying to persuade him. If you ask politely, people listen. I\\'m at the Ali Baba Motel, it\\'s on Grace and Yucca... It\\'s room 222, I\\'m Bobby Dorfman, so... 10.15? That seems fine, 10.15. No, I don\\'t care... No, of course not... Blonde, brunette ... whatever. Great. I\\'ll be waiting. This is the room you want. Your dig got my room by mistake. Oh God, oh sorry! Hi, come on in. Sorry, sorry... Jesus. What the hell did you do? I\\'m sorry, I wrote it down wrong. I live here so now everybody has to know. - Do I look like a working girl? - Look at yourself, are you kidding me? Where were you ? I\\'m ready to go to sleep. I know, I know my car got a flat. I\\'m sorry I\\'m late. My name\\'s Candy. You\\'re late, you get the wrong room ... I could use one. Yeah? Fine help yourself. You know, I do not usually do this. Oh, can I let you in on a secret? I\\'ve never taken money before so we\\'re both in the same boat. What are you saying, this is your first job? It is... so if I seem a little disorganized... My god. Tony sent you over here and you\\'re not even a real pro. Not yet. You don\\'t have any qualms about going down this road? I need a job. My acting career is not going anywhere... Ok, but think. I need the money. You know what... You don\\'t have to sleep with me but I\\'ll give you the money. No it\\'s ok. I\\'ve made up my mind. I don\\'t want it on my conscience, it\\'s too much for me. It\\'s alright, I\\'m willing. Willing? thank you very much, like taking medicine? No, you\\'re not some big fat schiener. Hey look, you\\'re nervous and now you\\'re making me nervous. I\\'m not nervous to go to bed. I actually just got out of a pretty hot romance... But I\\'ve never paid anyone to do it with me before. Incidentally I need the $20 in advance. There\\'s nothing sexy about the two of us going through the motions... Take the money and go. Don\\'t you want to try me? I\\'m so lonely I would have been happy just to talk but now I\\'m too tired for that. Am I not attractive? You\\'re ok, you\\'re fine, it\\'s me I have a headache. This town is full of fantastic looking girls. They come from all over looking to get into the movies. So you don\\'t want to go to bed with me? I\\'m not in the mood, sorry. I lost it. Oh Jesus, don\\'t cry. Come on, if it\\'s going to kill you we\\'ll do it. All I ask is that we turn the lights out. I got a feeling this line of work is not really right for you. Hey look... I came over here a little late... but now it\\'s you that\\'s backing down. Because you\\'re making me tense. Give me the bottle I need another drink. Maybe if we just took our clothes off and got into bed. No I can\\'t, it\\'s too mechanical. Here, just take the $20. Forget it, I\\'ll go. I\\'m sorry I screwed everything up. I\\'m sorry too. I should never have started this, it\\'s not really my style. Don\\'t be upset. It has nothing to do with your looks. Don\\'t take it personally. - You don\\'t want to do it? - If it\\'s so important to you we\\'ll do it! Come on. We\\'ll do it. Let\\'s go. Come on. Here, take the money. So what is your name, Cindy? It\\'s Candy. Candy? Is that a real name? What is that? Candice? No, not really... But it\\'s a sexy name don\\'t you think? It\\'s ok. My real name is Shirley. Shirley Garfein. You\\'re a Jew? Yeah, so? A Jewish hooker. Is this a first? Don\\'t act so shocked. I\\'m not going to make a career of it. Take the $20 and go. Please go. Oh no, what\\'s wrong? Nothing, I just, can\\'t.... Please? Are you sure? I\\'m very sure. It was nice to meet you. Please don\\'t talk to anyone on the way out. - I\\'m sorry. - It\\'s fine. It\\'s just down this hall. Come in! Come in! Sorry I\\'ve been so hard to get to. I\\'ve been going through all this Howard Hawks thing at Chicago. That\\'s okay, Uncle Phil. Sit. So... what\\'s the story? Rose tells me you want to live out here? Yes. I could not go on in my father\\'s business... It was stultifying. I want to do something more interesting with my life. Hello? Hi Paul. Yeah it\\'s a mess down there. Adolphe Menjou is threatening to walk off the picture. I\\'ll give you the details Friday. You\\'ll be at the poker game, right? Alright, we\\'ll talk then. I\\'m tied up right now. Great. You can\\'t believe the last couple of weeks... Christ, it\\'s all about ego. This town runs on ego. I\\'m Bobby. Ben is my brother though, so it\\'s understandable. So, what the hell... What can I do for you? Hold on... Oh Jesus what? Absolutely. Yes. Lunch on Friday at the Brown Derby. And bring Harry because I agree Joel McCrea would be perfect to play the lead. Absolutely, see you Friday. And don\\'t disappoint me by canceling with some phoney excuse. What do you think of Joel McCrea? I think he\\'s a great movie star. What I like about Joel is he can play drama and give me the light touch... Great range... So? What are you plans? Are you planning on staying out here? I thought if you know of something I can get started with? Something at your agency? Here, like what? I don\\'t know. Like something... I kind of need a job. We have nothing here at the moment, if you\\'re talking about the mail room. The mail room? Yeah... Sure, something to begin with. If something comes in the mail room I could let you know. There is nothing here now then? Unless... I put you on working for me. We can come up with some title... I always have some errands to run... I\\'ll do anything. You know anybody in town? No, I don\\'t. Hotel life is the worst right? Karen and I will invite you over for dinner... we have these parties... Sunday brunches, we\\'ll invite you. You\\'ll meet some nice people. Vonnie, come in here can you? Check in with me each day and I\\'ll have some odd jobs for you to do. This is so nice of you Uncle Phil. Stop with the \"Uncle\". It\\'s Phil. We don’t want to over emphasis the nepotism. Bobby. This is my nephew. He just moved out here... Maybe you could help get him orientated. Show him the town. Right now he\\'s at sea. Absolutely. Anytime this weekend? Are you free Saturday? Yes, great. Fantastic. Very nice to meet you. When you leave I\\'ll get your information. She looks nice. Dear Evelyn, just a note to say hello. I\\'d call more frequently but between Mom and Dad and you and Ben... the long distance calls are probably bankrupting everybody. Ben sent me a few bucks so I\\'m managing. I gotta job with Uncle Phil... not much of a job but he\\'s going to have me to dinner and introduce me to some contacts. His secretary is going to show me around this weekend. She is very pretty. Dear Bobby, It\\'s raining here today. Very pretty, but a bit melancholy. Leonard says it\\'s the poignancy of life: and not only do we have to embrace it\\'s meaninglessness... but celebrate life because it has no meaning. It\\'s too deep for me but Mom always boils it down to... \"Live every day like it\\'s your last. \"And someday you\\'ll be right.\" - Thank you very much for driving. - Of course. - So? - So... So where shall we start? The Beverly Hills homes? The fancy-smancy movie stars homes? Great. I\\'m game. This is Spencer Tracy\\'s house. I think it\\'s one of the prettiest ones. It\\'s not all done up. And wait, who is that one? I don\\'t know. A little pretentious though, don\\'t you think? Is it? To me these all seem like the Taj Mahal. I know the feeling. And here is where Joan Crawford lives. It takes your breath away. Look at that car. - You know I met Miss Crawford once? - Really? She is a client of your Uncle\\'s. - What is she like? - Beautiful. You really knew why she was a movie star. She was larger than life. I can not imagine what it would be like to be larger than life. Sure it would be fun for a while... I think I\\'d be happier being life sized. This is Robert Taylor\\'s house. If you could choose one house to live in on the block... which would you pick? I don\\'t think I would choose Beverly Hills. Why not ? I love living by the beach, you know... My apartment is just a short ride from the ocean. I get to stare at it all day... I feel sorry for these people, needing to feel important in these big houses. I talk like this now... I\\'m the same as every other girl in town with all the same ambitions, but... You wanted to be a movie star? I liked acting. In school. Where was school? Nebraska. I thought I\\'d come to Hollywood and live in one of these big houses with a swimming pool... hob-knob with all the glamorous types. Go to openings... You grow up and... quickly realise if you have half a brain what a silly life that can be. Lovely, charming, and uncorrupted by the values of a seductive city, that worshiped fame and box-office records, Vonnie enchanted him, although he was too scared to ask if she had a boyfriend. To quote his brother, the great philosopher: \"Some questions you don\\'t wanna know the answers to.\" Meanwhile, he labored at the trivial errands his Uncle had him doing. and it was only the thought that she was free again the following Saturday and he could see her... that gave him something to look forward to. - Here you go two beers. - Thank you sir. Wow that movie! - I loved it, did you like it? - Yeah, of course. Barbara Stanwyckis really one of my favorites. This place is great and you were not kidding when you said it was a joint. It\\'s not the Brown Derby or Chasen\\'s, where you have to make an entrance or sit at the right table... next to Mr. Goldwyn or James Cagney. Have you ever heard Mr. Goldwyn speak? He sounds like a comic. He\\'s accent is extreme. It\\'s hilarious. I didn\\'t expect that. What are you thinking? Just that... you\\'re very beautiful. Thank you. I don\\'t think that a very good idea actually... I\\'m seeing someone. Oh. What\\'s he like? Doug is a journalist. I just thought, since you have so much free time on your hands... He travels a lot. And I really like spending my time with you if that\\'s ok... You\\'re very sweet. Have you heard that before? You have this deer in the headlights quality. Thank you. If I was your boyfriend, I would not travel. Or if I did I would take you with me. I hope he knows how to kiss you and all the rest... It\\'s between us. I\\'m just looking out for your best interests. - Thank you! - I am. - What would I do without you ? - I dunno. Honey! - You know Karen. - Actually we never really met. Phil speaks very highly of you... He\\'s been meaning to invite you to one of our brunches for the longest time Thank you so much and I appreciate everything he\\'s done for me. I may have some good news for you... I thought I saw Joan Blondell here. Is that possible? She\\'s around here somewhere. I hear Louis is going absolutely out of his mind... because his new picture is gonna bomb. Spencer is great. Spencer is always great. Am I right? They\\'ll never see their money back. Gentlemen, say hello to Bobby Dorfman. Hi, how are you? Mike was just saying what a bath M.G.M.\\'s gonna take with their new film. Howard, Rad, Steve, come on over here! It\\'s not the best news of your life? Howard Fox, Bobby Dorfman. Howard\\'s a two time academy award winner. - Wow, congratulations! - Thank you. If you\\'ve never heard of me I am writer. Rad Taylor, Bobby Dorfman. Rad and Steve are New Yorkers, just like you. Steve runs our New York law firm. I do run their New York law firm but I have a question for you Phil... you said that during this trip I could meet Greta Garbo. Where is she? Oh, she\\'s impossible. She\\'s alone somewhere, there\\'s where she is! - Bobby, who would you like to meet? - Er, Babe Ruth. Present company excepted. I don\\'t care how many men she sleeps with, she\\'ll never get that part. Have you seen her in a bathing suit? Huge thighs. Not M.G.M.thighs. It is your faithful Hollywood reporter calling like he said he would... Yes, yes it\\'s me. I think you\\'re actually lucky that your boss doesn\\'t invite you to these things... It is everything that you can\\'t stand, its... all industry talk and name dropping and catty backstabbing. Yeah but there are a few faces that you\\'d recognise from the screen. Oh, me ? I\\'m kinda half bored, half fascinated, I\\'m... I would trade it for Tacos with you at that little Mexican joint. Yeah, I\\'m sure if you were here we\\'d have a million wicked laughs together. Yeah but, no of course, go... No, no. I will speak to you later. If you look closely I\\'m in there. These photos are incredible. I recognise so many famous faces. Keep going until you get to a unknown 10 year old. What? No, is this you? That\\'s me, right next to DW Griffith. Oh my goodness! I grew up in this town but thank god I married a confirmed New Yorker. Oh yeah, that\\'s right. What do you do there? I run a modeling agency. Oh really? Are there are more beautiful girls in Hollywood or New York? Why? Is that how you\\'ll decide where you\\'ll live? No, I\\'m just curious. There\\'s more out here. I\\'m sure you\\'ll have no trouble finding suitable companionship. Unfortunately the most beautiful woman I\\'ve met out here already has a boyfriend. That\\'s life! That\\'s why Rodgers & Hart get rich. Sorry, I think I\\'m a little drunk. I\\'ve never mixed champagne and bagels before. Welcome to Hollywood. What do you do? Menial errands are my specialty but I don\\'t see a big future in it. - We met down stairs. - Absolutely. he\\'s a fellow New Yorker suffering from unrequited love... Oh no. Unrequited love kills more people per year than tuberculosis. I believe you! - I\\'m kidding! - I know, but it sounds... If you ever find yourself back in New York and you\\'re still broken hearted... call us and I will introduce you to any number of eligible young goddesses... who, believe me, are just as lonely as you... despite their fabulous measurements! Thank you, maybe I\\'ll take you up on that. Listen Bobby, If you\\'re bored out here we can always invite you to a screening of... a new film I\\'ve wisely invested in last week. Really? I would love to go. - Does that sound good? - Yes, of course. thank you so much. Bring your girlfriend if you can pry her loose from her lover! There you are! I was looking for you. I have some good news. Vonnie... Hi. You free tonight ? I\\'m not. You sure? I was hoping to take you out to celebrate. - Celebrate what? - I got a promotion. And a raise. I\\'m going to be reading scripts. That is fantastic! I\\'m so happy for you! I was hoping to take you to a screening. I got invited by... some big producer. Can I take a rain check? Yes! Of course, but I was hoping to buy you champagne. How about dinner on... Wednesday? Yes Ok... Dinner it is. I\\'ll take you someplace very fancy. I will have to get all dressed up... maybe we can stay at your place? And I can cook for us. You cook? I don\\'t make pheasant or souffle or anything like that, but ... I can manage spaghetti and meatballs? Yes, that\\'s great. You can play me those Jazz records I\\'ve been dying to hear... My mother cooks spaghetti and meatballs... but when a Jew cooks something it\\'s always overcooked. they wanna make sure to kill all the germs, so... I think I\\'ll prefer yours! It was his first experience of a private screening in a producers home... and it was a good movie. And he wished Vonnie could have been there with him to share it. But she had warned him from the start she had a boyfriend. Sorry I\\'m late. There was traffic, can you believe it? Late or on time you always look beautiful to me. Could I have a white wine please? I\\'m sure it\\'s just the candlelight. I\\'ve made up my mind... I\\'m going to have a talk with Karen as soon as she gets back from Toronto. Her Mother is much better. Are you sure this is what you want? I can\\'t go on sneaking around... grabbing moments with you in hotel rooms and dark bars. I\\'m in love with you. You\\'ve been saying that, I just don’t want to feel that I\\'ve broken up... your marriage. I want to be honest, Karen and I have a long history and not a bad one. Would I walk out on her if I hadn\\'t met you? Probably not. But I did meet you. Of course I want to be with you. I just hate the duplicity of this. I know. It\\'s not fair for you to live this. You\\'ve been  so understanding about it. Too understanding, really. I love you, Vonnie. Oh, my heart beats faster when you say that to me. Looks like my hope not anxiety. Yes, with excitement. I\\'m excited. Dare I kiss you? I dare you not. Dear Bobby, I understand you met some girl you\\'re crazy about. Your last letter said she had a boyfriend. A journalist. My advice is to not give up. Send her some flowers and keep trying. You said she\\'s not the type that gets impressed with presents but women appreciate little gifts. Just a word to the wise... As for Ben, he\\'s getting involved in the nightclub business. What does he know of running a club? He\\'s up to his neck in Union problems but so far he\\'s been able to deal with them. Ben Dorfman, Benny to his friends. Ten typewriters were stolen over the weekend! He was always in trouble with the Law, even going back to school days. He grew up in a Jewish neighborhood and most of the kids got educations... and lots of them became doctors or lawyers. But not all. Some were tough Jews and picked the streets. Harry Cantor owes me $ 6,000. Collect if for me, I\\'ll give you a third. You do it this week, I\\'ll take you to Duffinetti\\'s for a nice steak. He wasn\\'t going to struggle like his father going from one menial job to another. His friend Abe got 20 cents an hour for lugging big crates of stationary. He got $50 for fixing up some furs in the garment district. Tony Rondalino taught them to hold up craps games. The games were illegal and when he took the money they couldn\\'t go to the cops. He split the money with Tony. One night he was sitting in his car with Tony. He had enough to buy a car. A guy came up, calm as can be... put his gun through the window and killed Tony. Education in the streets came violently. Now he and his partners owned the club Hangover. He wore expensive suits... but under those suits he was still Benny from the streets. Have a good trip. I envy you. I miss New York so much right now. My business can\\'t be without me for too long or everyone falls apart. I\\'m sure they do. Good luck with everything. Thank you. She\\'s coming over to cook spaghetti this week. I keep deluding myself... If only I had the right wine, music, candlelight ... Take it from me, she likes you if she spends so much time with you. Steve and I are rooting for you. - Stay in touch. - You too. Bobby, I want to tell you that I can\\'t make it tonight. Something came up. It\\'s an emergency. I have to reschedule. But I\\'ve laid everything out. I\\'ve opened the wine to let it breathe. Can I make it up to you? I promise I will. I got you an anniversary present... Look... It\\'s a letter written and signed by Rudolph Valentino. It\\'s paper. Our first year is paper, so... I found this amazing memorabilia shop. I can\\'t do it, Vonnie. Can\\'t do what? I can\\'t leave Karen. It was your idea... I can\\'t see you anymore. This is putting me in an early grave. I thought I could tell her... But Christ, we\\'ve been married for 25 years, we have kids. You don\\'t owe me any explanation. I can\\'t lead a double life. It\\'s not fair to you. Or to Karen or to myself. Okay. It\\'s not that I do not love you ... It\\'s just the situation is too difficult. And it\\'s pointless to move on... I understand. That\\'s what you were going to say, right? Something like that. Look, I know ... that we can\\'t just both... forget that this happened. Your secret is safe with me if that\\'s what your worried about? I would never tell anyone. Oh my gosh! Are you okay? I\\'m probably too late for dinner, right? Dinner? Well... Are you OK? I do not want to impose on you like this... It\\'s not an imposition. What\\'s wrong? I can\\'t stop crying. This is so stupid. Tell me what happened. My boyfriend just dumped me. Sorry. Yes, it\\'s all over. I\\'m so sorry. What happened? I brought him an anniversary present. It was our paper anniversary so one year. It was a Valentino letter. It was beautiful... signed and written by Valentino. That is so nice. He can\\'t leave his wife, I know that... - We can\\'t go on like that forever. - I didn\\'t realise he was married. - Can we have a glass of white wine? - Yes, of course. If it hasn\\'t evaporated. It\\'s been breathing for hours. Sorry, that happens in this motel. It should be over soon. I had never suspected he was married, although... I am so slow to pick up on anything. That is one of your sweetest qualities. You\\'re very naive. Thank you. I guess you must have really loved him. He was very wonderful. I\\'m sure. I\\'ll forget about it. I have to be honest... I\\'m of two minds... I feel sorry for you but I\\'m glad you don\\'t have a boyfriend anymore. But for selfish reasons. I\\'ve always known how you\\'ve felt about me... and it\\'s been flattering. I\\'ve been in love with you from the first moment I laid my eyes on you... and I thought you were a movie star. Honestly I don\\'t think I ever want to fall in love again. It just happened, you need time. I\\'ll get over it. I\\'m not usually such a fragile person... but it took me by surprise. It really did. That is always the risk, when you get involved with with a married man. That\\'s what my roommate said. But he just over-whelmed me. He... is incredibly alive and... and very exciting. That\\'s a very imaginative gift you got for a paper anniversary... a love letter from Rudolph Valentino. That is very charming. I thought so. Maybe next year I\\'ll be lucky enough to get you a love letter from your favorite actress Barbara Stanwyck. It\\'s sweet. Maybe Vonnie was heartbroken the way things had turned out with the affair... but Bobby decidedly was not. He took it upon himself with great pleasure... to try and help her forget her former lover... and try she did. They spent weekends at the beach... and went to the movies almost every night. -\" I\\'ll be there\". -\"You go right ahead, I trust you\". They visited all the great movie palaces in Hollywood... which were grand and beautiful, and not very expensive. And as time passed... Vonnie did start to succumb to Bobby\\'s charm and loving attention. And what began originally as a casual friendship... blossomed into a genuine romance. Lets move to New York. What? What I\\'d really like to say is...marry me and lets move to New York. We\\'ll get a spot in Greenwich Village... I will find work there and I\\'ll spoil you... I think it would be great. Look the truth is... I\\'m a little disillusioned with the whole scene out here. I was like you, I dreamed of the house and pool, the exciting movie stars but... but it is really kind of a boring, nasty, dog eat dog industry. Come on, let\\'s get married and move to New York. It will be great. Greenwich Village, that\\'s where all the poets and painters live, right? I can\\'t promise we\\'d ever be rich but we\\'d have each other. And my brother Ben owns a nightclub. He\\'s asked me to help him run it. I don\\'t know anything about it but Ben\\'s a great guy. And I\\'m a quick learner. And a nightclub\\'s not like working in some drab office. Let\\'s face it, even though you had a boyfriend you\\'ve had a feeling for me underneath. You have. We\\'d make a great team in New York. It sounds exciting, it really does. Yeah? Come here. Phil, what\\'s wrong? You sounded so upset on the telephone. You want a drink? No thank you. What\\'s on your mind? Just let me... You alright? Why do you ask? Lately you\\'ve been smoking more and drinking more. You\\'re been a little crotchety at work. I\\'m not alright. I hope you are not ill. I need to talk, Bobby ... to somebody I trust. You can certainly talk to me... You\\'re family. So what\\'s the matter? I\\'ve decided I\\'m going to leave my wife. I\\'ve been back and forth about this decision many times but the conclusion I\\'ve come to is I\\'ve fallen in love with another woman and I can\\'t live without her. I\\'m no expert in this area but these things do happen. Not to me, they don\\'t! I never cheated. Never looked at another woman in 25 years. Jesus, you know Karen, she\\'s wonderful! She\\'s wonderful! She is, I agree. And the a year ago... this dream, this angel ... dropped out of the sky. I became hooked. I know... but when it\\'s right I think you just know it. Yes, this is right! This is right! And this woman loves you I\\'m assuming? I believe that she does. Although I have jerked her around for a year... telling her I was going to leave Karen... and then I couldn\\'t and then I would and I didn\\'t. I can\\'t tell her I\\'m going to do it yet again and not... get her hopes up. I have to just do it. Hope she hasn\\'t met someone else. No, I\\'m sure if she really loves you... She is much younger than I am. So what is age? Nothing means anything if your actually in love. I am so consumed with guilt over Karen because she has done nothing to alienate me... She is bright and cheerful and loyal. - Her sex was always very good. - Oh nice. But with this other woman, it\\'s fantastic! Good, but ... people go through these things and with time they come out ok. I\\'m sure she\\'ll be fine. Yes. Karen will be well taken care of. Christ, she\\'ll get half of everything I\\'m worth! If there\\'s anything I can do for you...ever... I just wanted to talk. I\\'ve been carrying this knot around in my chest for so long. Sorry you\\'ve been burdened with that. You can always talk to me. Thanks. So is it true? Maybe getting a little homesick? Yes, I needed to move away from Manhattan to realise what a New-Yorker I am at heart. Do you mind if I?... It\\'s understandable. People come out here all the time... and decide the life\\'s not for them. You have a girl back in New York? I\\'m hoping I will and If I have you can take 10% for it. For what? For introducing me to Vonnie. I think she\\'s going to marry me and move to Manhattan with me. Phil Stern could not believe what he was hearing. He had worried Vonnie had found someone else... but never dreamed it was his nephew. He had been taken with his new secretary from that first day. Veronica Sybel. I have a masters degree in English lit\\' and drama. And yes, I can type. He was smitten with her face, and she was captivated... by his charm and his take charge vitality. And over the next months he overwhelmed her. And took risks doing it. I want to send fifty roses. That\\'s fifty ... Fifty percent. Yes, fifty red roses. And I want the card to read... \"Thanks for a fabulous weekend. \"I told you you wouldn\\'t get seasick, with me there. \"I love you. Philip.\" You know what? Make that a hundred red roses. You are amazing. - No, you are. - Thank you. I was in the moon. The thought of the two of us in some great village apartment... Who would have thought when I first came out here... I know. Everyone\\'s lives are so unpredictable. It\\'s funny, my Uncle Phil, your former employer, who\\'s so dynamic and full of confidence actually confided in me... He\\'s been so hopelessly miserable lately. Apparently he\\'s been having an affair with a woman who he\\'s very much in love with... But he\\'s been having trouble bringing himself to leave his wife. But apparently he is so in love with this other person that he has decided to leave Karen... and plans to marry this other woman. He\\'s been suffering so much because he likes and respects his wife but he can not live without the other woman. I did not have the nerve to ask if it was a movie star! - What\\'s the matter? - Is he leaving his wife...? He tried and backed down a dozen times, but he said... he cannot live without this other person. That\\'s what he said. There is no question if you hear him, he is very much in love. What are you thinking? You seem... so lost in thought. Sorry. No, nothing. What are you thinking about? Just, nothing. Oh no... I\\'ve made you nervous with my babbling about about marriage and us moving to New York. That it ? That\\'s it. That is quite a big thought. It is. Sorry. Thank you, have a wonderful night. Phil, we\\'ve been over this a million times. Things have changed. can we go someplace and talk? Where? Our usual dark bar? No, absolutely not I work here. I told Karen. That was a little presumptuous given the circumstances don\\'t you think? What do you mean? Are you actually considering moving to New York with my nephew? Do you know about that? Who told you? No secret is safe for very long in this town. Ours was. Don\\'t tell me you\\'ve changed your mind? Hi, Louis. - Any word on the MGM thing? - We should know by the end of the week. I love you. Is all that we meant to each other nothing? I do not know what I think, I\\'m confused. Can you blame me? No, I can\\'t. And if you tell me to go to hell I\\'ll understand. I will kill myself but I\\'ll know where you\\'re coming from. First you\\'re leaving, then you\\'re not then you are then you can\\'t. I never pushed you to leave her. In fact I never even asked you to leave over me. And now you\\'re here telling me you\\'ve left? What am I supposed to do with that? I know, I\\'ve been wishy-washy but the thought of losing you ... It is a white ermine fur. Can you believe the studio requires us to wear fur in this weather! - There you go. - That\\'s the one. Thank you. I understand that it hasn\\'t been easy but if it is so hard... why should we have to... You\\'ve never got back to me about Bill Powell? - On what? - William Powell, Paramount. I think he\\'s going to pass but I\\'ll give him another call tomorrow. Vonnie, I don\\'t want you working here. I want to marry you and take care of you for the rest of your life. I can\\'t believe you cooled on me so quickly! And for Christ\\'s sake with who? My nephew? He\\'s a nice kid but where the hell\\'s he going? You said it was possible yourself to have feelings for two people. You love him too? I don\\'t believe it. Believe it. I do. You love me. I do not know. I think so... I\\'m not sure. I\\'m very mixed up. - We on for lunch Thursday? - Absolutely. Sure, sure. I\\'m gonna bring Judy Garland. You\\'ll love this kid. I think we could end up representing her. Really? Well ok, bring her along. I met Judy over at Billy Wilder\\'s dinner party so I know Judy. - See you Thursday. - See you Thursday. I\\'m not going to stand here pleading. I love you. I have loved you for over a year. I handled this as best I could. maybe poorly at times. But of matters of the heart people do foolish things. Think over my offer. I want you to be my wife. Now. I will die if you say no. I\\'m going home to tell Karen. I thought you\\'d told Karen? I told her that I will be speaking about a very serious matter this evening. Charlie, I need to talk to you about that John Ford movie. Vonnie was perplexed. Two men were in love with her. One a dynamic and successful powerhouse... The other, a younger man who clearly adored her. She shared her problem with her roommate, Rosalind, who at first came down strongly for marrying Phil Stern, but then wavered as she found Bobby very likeable, and passionately in love with Vonnie. Sorry, I thought everyone on this floor had gone home. - Have a drink. - That\\'s ok. We are family, we can drink together. Is something the matter? You\\'re part of the only family I have left now I\\'ve left Karen. Did you? I hope it wasn\\'t too painful for you? How are things going with you and Vonnie? It\\'s okay. Although I think she\\'s gotten a little nervous lately. Did she say anything? She\\'s just nervous about our plans to get married and move to New York, So I feel it\\'s best if I don\\'t push it. Although she loves me, I know, and I truly believe she\\'s looking forward to marrying me, because if there were too people ever meant for each other. Come on! Don\\'t look so glum. I\\'m sure your situation will work itself out. Although it may have been more prudent to wait until you\\'d told Karen. Don\\'t lecture me on being prudent! I understand timing. Timing is everything in life. The worst mistake you can make in business it being premature. - I know that... - Just remember! If you marry her I\\'m looking for my 10%. Okay, it\\'s a deal. I don\\'t want to ask you who you\\'re in love with, I guess it must be a ravishing movie star. No, she\\'s not a movie star. I\\'m not shallow. I\\'m not seduced by cheap glamor. I value substance and character. What the hell do you think I am? I wasn\\'t implying anything like that, I thought it might be Hedy Lamarr, I know how much she adores you. Like all your clients do. That is what makes you such a success. That was a gift. I had it framed. It\\'s a love letter from Rudolph Valentino. She gave me that on our one year anniversary, which is paper. What a surprise. What are you doing here? Are you going to marry me or my Uncle Phil? I\\'m going to  marry Phil. It\\'s so nice to get together for the Seder. I have to say, selfishly, It\\'s been so nice since you\\'re back from Hollywood. And we\\'re all together again. So much for your brother taking him under his wing. Phil was helping him, but he didn\\'t take to it out there. I knew you\\'d hate it out there. I only wish my brother Phil was in New York so he could come tonight. I\\'d love to meet his new wife. Wouldn\\'t you, Martin? I don\\'t have to. You know how I feel about your brother. He\\'s not a Jewish man! What kind of man throws out his wife of 25 years... to run off with a 25 year old secretary? I hate to tell you how many go with their secretaries. Bobby says she was really beautiful. So is looks everything? Where\\'s character, where\\'s loyalty? You\\'re no beauty contest winner but I stuck with you. That\\'s enough wine for you. Love is an emotion. And emotions are not rational. You \"fall\" in love. You lose control. I have dated many wonderful women, but the minute I laid eyes on your daughter I knew Evelyn was for me. It was pure luck! If my cab driver hadn\\'t driven his cab through the plate glass window of a restaurant, I never would have met Leonard. He was having coffee. We barreled right into him! It didn\\'t spill. Bobby, you met her. It she so fabulous? She is very lovely. She\\'s now one of those stuck up Hollywood movie queens? No, she\\'s a very down to earth girl. You\\'d like her. I think she\\'ll be good for Phil. I think Daddy\\'s right. A wife is not like a car, you don\\'t just trade her in after years for the latest model. That’s what our neighbor did, he kicked his wife out for a cheap stripper... then knocked her teeth out. He\\'s a lunatic. We live next to a crazy man. I\\'m scared of him. He pushed Leonard. He didn\\'t push me. He\\'s a hothead. He bumped me. I was trying to explain that he was blocking our driveway. Some people only understand a good punch in the nose. That is not Leonard\\'s style. Leonard thinks everyone can be reasoned with. You have to accept the premise of common humanity, otherwise you\\'re in the jungle with the beasts. The idea is to always get in the first punch. You don\\'t wait for the other guy. How\\'d you like working for your big brother? I am very lucky. Thank you. When you came home you were a lost soul for a while. I like working at the nightclub, it\\'s very lively. He took to it like a fish in water. You should see him work the room. Everyone likes him. Not like that first manager. That deadbeat who wound up stealing from you. He\\'s not around anymore. Bobby looked up his socialite friends Rad Taylor and her husband Steve. Who came to the club and spread the word amongst the beautiful models she worked with. She got Bobby to re-decorate, and change the name of the club to the more chi chi... Les Tropiques? I just love it! It sounds upscale and international...and hot! I have you to thank. Soon Les Tropiques was known as the place one could always find the driest Martinis... and the prettiest women in Manhattan. Beautiful girls attracted celebrities and sports figures. Socialites mingled with politicians. And with the smart set came the press, and an ever growing reputation. Bobby moved more and more gracefully amongst the rich and famous. And learned the in\\'s and out\\'s of Café Society, which included any number of prominent figures from New York\\'s glamorous underworld. There were the Rhinebecks, who came almost every night and ordered the finest wines in the world. They seemed like an ideal couple, except he was sleeping with his wife\\'s sister. And there was no shortage of royalty from all over Europe. Like Count Henrick Van Goren who played backgammon for millions. And his wife, the Countess Van Goren, who was actually Chickie Sherman from Passaic, New Jersey. And that ring on Suzy Bancroft\\'s finger, was a mere 41 carats. Of course along with the elite came the tabloid scandals. Like Tom Price the Wall street genius... married to the much taller automobile heiress Linda Ray Harmon. He ran through her fortune on racehorses and showgirls, until one day, out hunting, she mistook him for a deer. And Bobby met them all and shook their hands and joked with them. And heard their sad and happy stories... over thousand dollar magnums of Piper-Heidsieck. And learned about life. and how in the end, Rodgers & Hart had it right. It is so beautiful out here and you two have been so great to me. Oh please, don\\'t suddenly become revoltingly sweet. Your wife hates any show of emotion. But your friendship has meant so much to me. And Steve, you got me with such a brilliant financial adviser. I know you\\'re used to playing with millions and I\\'m a whole other league... but at the rate I\\'m going you may see applying for membership at your golf club. To get into his golf club you have to be a lawyer or stockbroker, and can\\'t be circumcised. Well if nothing else, I owe you everything. And I can never repay you for introducing me... to the most wonderful thing of all... my wife. Enter en que! He was just going to tell us again how you\\'re like a Gershwin tune and you walked in. Stop! Hi darling, how\\'s your martini? Good! You caught me talking about you. Bobby found a wife. After assorted unsatisfying flirtations and affairs... one night in the club, in walked a group. And his eye was caught by an elegant young blonde. That\\'s Veronica Hayes. She just got divorced. Her husband left her for her best friend. It came as a shock to her. My goodness... She\\'s a great girl. We all felt so bad for her. Maybe we can cheer her up. Can you introduce me? - Veronica, you look beautiful! - You too. - Good to see you. - You too. I\\'d like you to meet Bobby Dorfman. He runs the place. Is this your first time here? Yes. The papers were right, it\\'s got real electricity... It does, right? - We\\'re happy to have you. - Thank you. My goodness... She\\'s single? - Yes ! - It\\'s a criminal offense. Excuse me. What are you doing later? Later? There is no later it\\'s 1.30am. I get off in half an hour. I\\'m usually in pajamas by 2 am. I love pajamas. What side of the bed do you like? Slow down! He\\'s pushier than you! Come on, you guys... You like jazz music? At 2 in the morning? At any time in the morning. Your name is Veronica, right? Anybody ever call you Vonnie for short? Not usually, no. It\\'s a pretty name. But you like jazz though? Yeah, I love jazz. Well it\\'s fate. Who doesn\\'t love jazz? I have met one woman... Terrible. This is great. I\\'d love another scotch. My one regret in life is I can\\'t play an instrument. - I used to date a musician. - Did you? A Sax player, very brilliant. He\\'d play those sad songs with so much feeling. It can make you cry. It\\'s a great gift. I would have married him but he was a dope addict. I don\\'t like dope. It messes you up. I tried it a few times when I was with him. We smoked weed first and I even tried opium once. Look at you! What was the effect? I didn\\'t Ike it. I don\\'t have an addictive personality. He did. But Muggles made me feel sexy. - Sorry, Muggles? - The reefers. - You call them Muggles? - He did. So you married a musician? I married a stock broker. You divorced? he divorced me because my best friend was better in bed. - Was she? - Yeah, I guess! He should have saved some of the Muggles. I learned too late that I can get where I need to with two or three drinks. So what do you do? I work in City Hall, the mayor\\'s office. - Really? Doing what ? - Public relations. I hope you don\\'t mind a Democratic liberal? My whole family are democrats, we\\'re Jews so... How quaint! That plays right into my rebellious streak. In Oklahoma, we weren\\'t even allowed to mingle with Jews growing up. You guys are money lenders! We control everything, actually. I didn\\'t even see a Jew until I moved to New York. No horns... I find Jews exotic and mysterious. I wouldn\\'t mind if you had horns. You wouldn\\'t? Ok lets go. We\\'ll go to my place. No, I\\'m not gonna sleep with you... No, Jew or no Jew, we just met! Have one or two more drinks... No thank you. You will just have to wait. My goodness! It\\'s true what they say! You people are pushy! It\\'s part of the charm. - I had a great time tonight. - Me too. Will you call me? Yes I will. I\\'ll call you tomorrow. And since it is tomorrow, I\\'ll call you in 15 minutes. So I should head home. Good night. In all that season they saw each other every single day. And it was a beautiful summer. Thank you, Rad. This is the last one. Then one Saturday afternoon, some months later, she made an announcement. I am pregnant. Are you crushed? No, it\\'s wonderful. So what\\'s our next move? I would like to have the baby. Unless you don\\'t want me to, I could go to Mexico and have it done safely. Vonnie, we are not going to Mexico we are going to... Niagara Falls, if anywhere. - Are you sure this is what you want? - Yes of course! When they call our kid a little bastard, you don\\'t want them to be right do you? You called me Vonnie. You\\'ve never called me that. If I did, I think I\\'ve had too much champagne. That\\'s what you said your old girlfriend was called. Well, ok...two Veronicas. What do you want me to say? I\\'m lucky. Are you going to marry me or not? - Yes of course! - Good. That\\'s the right answer! - We\\'re having a baby! - I love you. The wedding, which was a simple affair, and took place at City Hall two months later... was a happy event. But as Bobby\\'s brother in law said: life has it\\'s own agenda. Yes? What do you want? Could you turn down the radio, just a little? I\\'m not asking you to turn it off. My wife gets these migraines. Don\\'t tell me how to play my radio. Keep your nose outta my business. She rarely gets them... Just lower it. if she\\'s sick call your doctor! We did. He gives her something but migraines are a terrible curse. I work hard, I\\'m gonna play my radio. You don\\'t like it? Too bad! You\\'re not understanding me... I\\'m not asking you not to play it, just modulate the sound a little. I don\\'t want to call the police. You think I\\'m afraid of the police? I can play my radio! What can I say? He has the law on his side. I\\'ll gonna have my brother Ben talk to him. Ben is a hot-head. I am not looking for trouble. Promise me you won\\'t make this into an issue? He makes this into an issue! He needs somebody to read him the riot act! It\\'s not that big a deal. You don\\'t have the migraines! Bobby and Veronica named the baby Susan. In that fall, found the perfect house on the Hudson. We called the police and they spoke with him. and last week, he gets drunk and puts a dent in our car. When Leonard speaks to him about it he threatens to beat him up. He did? I need to talk to this character. Leonard doesn\\'t want trouble... But I think he needs someone to tell him we\\'re not going to stand for this anymore... and to stop making our lives miserable. He accuses us of things we\\'ve never done. He threatened to shoot our dog. He\\'s a crazy man! And my husband keeps deluding himself that he\\'s going to listen to reason, meanwhile... it never stops! He threatened to shoot your dog? I think he\\'s got a gun. He\\'s a security guard at a lumberyard. Joe Wojehowitz. - You Joe Wojehowitz? - Who wants to know? Are you are Joe Wojehowitz? Yeah. What? Joe, get in the car... - Why? - We want to talk. - What? - Get in the car! What are you doing? Get off me! Café Society it was called and Bobby Dorfman was right in the thick of it. There were the millionaire playboys like Buddy Winslow Fain, who bought anything he wanted, from high class models off the covers of every magazine in town... to the best seats at every show and sporting event. Then there were the politicians, who fixed your streets, your parking tickets and your tax returns. As long as the contributions kept coming in. There was Norton Lockerbee and his underage fiancee, the dancer Cherry Grace. And the Remsens, about whom it was said... had stayed a week in Berlin at the home of Adolf Hitler. And of course there were any number of colorful associates of Ben\\'s... some of whom were destined to end up on the front pages of the tabloids, leaking blood on the sidewalk due to cranial lintilation. It seemed Bobby knew everyone in Manhattan society. His wife Veronica now rarely came in, having succumbed to the joys of motherhood. Then one evening, in walked the past. May I help you? Yes. I understand my nephews are around usually. They own the place. Mr Dorfman? Bobby, yes. Or Ben. Ben\\'s not here tonight but Bobby\\'s around. Would you like to be seated? Please. I made a very big deal today. Champagne for the table! Before we start drinking for real. Fred, how are you? You remember Vonnie? We\\'re in town for a few weeks, we\\'ll catch up. It\\'s going to be a very big stock. I\\'m telling you it\\'s going through the roof. Now\\'s the time to get in on it, but you didn\\'t hear that here! - Didn\\'t hear what? - Exactly. Thank you, Marvin. There are some people to see you. They say they know you. Really? Table 4. Everybody knows me. Robert! How you doing? You remember Vonnie? And this is Gloria and Craig Bennett. Have a seat, join us. I wish I could but I\\'m very busy tonight. I can see! This place has a reputation all the way across the country! Please, join us. Sit down for five minutes. You\\'re going to offend us. Five minutes. - Look at you! - You look well! He does look well. We are celebrating because I just made a deal for Irene Dunne at Universal. I just love her. What is she like? She\\'s great, honestly. He has a...for Irene Dunne. Sorry, honey! - Tell her. - No, you tell her. We met Irene first at the Cocoanut Grove. We were with Errol Flynn and one of his gorgeous young \"discoveries\" as he likes to call them. And so... I know his reputation is not so great, but we adore him, he\\'s lovely. He hosted us off the coast of Catalina on his yacht and he was a gracious host. Irene, is ... a little... gorgeous in person but proper. We were at Busby Berkeley\\'s partying... She was asked to have a puff of a cigar. It was if she\\'d been asked to take her clothes off. She was mortified. Then Errol leans in and introduces her to this teenage starlet. Then she asks if it\\'s his daughter. Without missing a beat, Errol looks at her and says: \"No... \"This is my granddaughter.\" I died! In London, he was mobbed. I didn\\'t realise but he\\'s a great hero to the British. - I love London. - I could live there... I love it but I love Paris more. And Venice. We keep vowing to get a place there. Bob Montgomery and his wife have one. You ever met them? They are lovely. A gorgeous couple. Little Bobby... Wow, you really made it big Robert. I always knew you\\'d make it one way or another. I was breaking this kid in as an agent and he said he preferred New York. Which I completely understand. You\\'ll have to excuse me. I didn\\'t expect such a mad house in here tonight. We\\'ll be in town 4 or 5 weeks. Oh! And congratulations on becoming a dad! Absolutely! Frank, let me have a scotch. - Hey Bobby. How\\'s your wife? - She\\'s fine, thank you. We never see her around here anymore. She\\'s become very domestic since our daughter came. That\\'s what happens. They become mothers and everything falls off. If you know what I mean. Because hormones... Sometimes they never come back. Now I see are diapers. Listen. If you say I told you I\\'ll deny it. The DA\\'s office has had some serious discussions, About your brother, And his business friends. Meaning? I do not know yet, but it\\'s possible that things could get hot. I\\'m just giving you a heads up. Thank you. Can you do something about it? Can I help it if we have a clean mayor? So, what are they looking at? Racketeering, extortion, tax evasion... Maybe worse for Ben. My advice to your brother: is to go someplace for a while. He likes Havana. I will definitely tell him, thank you. Thank you for the heads up. Are you looking for something? Just you. Just wanted to say hello. Are you kidding me? Meaning what? Meaning that you should listen to yourself... You\\'ve become everything you used to poke fun at. Everything you couldn\\'t stand. You know... time passes, life moves on. People change. All the talk of the simple life... It would be comical if it wasn\\'t so sad. You\\'re not necessarily the same person you were either. No, you\\'re right. Life moves on ... People grow up. Have lunch with me. So you can impress me with name dropping and describing all the fancy parties you go to? No, I\\'ll behave myself. I won\\'t babble on like a Hollywood wife... if you promise to go easy on me for running off with Phil. Let\\'s just turn back the clock and take a walk. We can do it. I have a lot of time on my hands, I\\'m dying to know what\\'s going on with you. I will say you\\'re still... amazingly beautiful. I haven\\'t seen our next door neighbor in quite a while. Maybe he\\'s away. He was always out watering the lawn. It\\'s getting brown. And his mail is piling up. You think something\\'s wrong? You think he\\'s at home on the floor with a heart attack or something? Count your blessings. It would serve him right if he dropped dead. Don\\'t say that. Take that back! Shall I ask the police to come check? I wouldn\\'t. It\\'s not our business. Of course it\\'s our business. People are responsible for one another, even if he is a louse. I\\'d let it go if I were you. What is that supposed to mean? Is there something you\\'re not telling me? I\\'m worried, Leonard. Why, Evelyn? Is something going on I don\\'t know about? I may have done something wrong. What are you keeping from me? When we saw Bobby and Veronica\\'s baby, I told Ben that we were having trouble with our neighbor, and the police were not very helpful. Ben? I was scared of him Leonard! We have a child. He was a volatile neighbor, he was a drinker, he was nasty... He constantly made trouble. He was a security guard so I know he owns a gun. Who knew when he might fly off the handle! You didn\\'t have Ben threaten him? Or hurt him? I just asked Ben to talk to him. You tried speaking to him but you\\'re so mild mannered! I thought Ben would tell him if he did not start behaving himself... What? That he would break his legs? Has he broken his legs? I just asked Ben to talk to him. Just to tell him to back off. Or what? Ben is a thug, a gangster. Did he put him in the hospital? I don\\'t know, Leonard. And I don\\'t want to know. It\\'s wrong! It\\'s wrong! Is it a proportionate response that this poor guy, is laying in some hospital bed all beat up. This is delicious. And I love this place. It reminds me of our little Mexican joint, it\\'s a dump. It is. It\\'s not the Brown Derby, it\\'s not Busby Berkeley\\'s pool party... You won\\'t be running into Fred Astaire. How\\'s your wife? Tell me about her. I\\'m curious. She is lovely. What is her name? Veronica. - No it\\'s not! - It is. - Stop it. - She pronounces it differently. - I\\'m flattered. - I know. Life is a comedy, written by a sadistic comedy writer. I was in love with you and you decided to marry my uncle, what makes you ... my aunt. Aunt Vonnie. I think I still have a crush on you Aunt Vonnie. I\\'m in here. Honey! What is that? Flowers? - I can\\'t believe you got me flowers. - Why? What\\'s the occasion? I haven\\'t gotten you flowers in a long time. You\\'ve been in a very up mood all week, flowers... Did your numbers come in or are you guilty of something? A husband can\\'t get his wife flowers without getting the third degree! No. I love them. Of course you can. I love you. Thank you. With Phil busy, Bobby used every excuse to spend time with Vonnie. He showed her around Manhattan and took her to Coney Island. And when she remembered she still owed him that dinner she never got to cook for him in Hollywood, he arranged for her to do it Downtown. I hope that it\\'s perfect, I make it the same every time... but I\\'ve been going on about it for years now... If it\\'s not perfect then you can go back in the kitchen and re-cook the whole thing. Or you could put that block of cheese on it... That\\'s true. I\\'m sure it will be fine. In fact I\\'ve known the Pugioni\\'s for years... - Long time. - How long Vito? Real long. For me a really long time but I\\'m glad you\\'ve made good on your promise and cooked for me! Good wine. This is such an inspired idea... You don\\'t have to lie. It was superb. It was absolutely superb. Vito, tell her. - Delicious. - Thank you. Would he lie? - Would I lie? - I don\\'t think so. Where are we going next? I don\\'t want to go home yet. Vito, anything? There\\'s a craps game at Brooklyn. You feel lucky? That\\'s amazing! Loaded dice! Beginners luck. That\\'s her second roll. I just keep going and going? Yes, of course if you\\'re doing well. New York really is fabulous. And I would know, I\\'ve been traveling quite a lot. I know you\\'ve mentioned that. How could you choose anywhere else? I know Hollywood\\'s occasionally exiting but... but nothing beats Broadway or the cheesecake at Lindy\\'s. Listen to you... Drinking wine in Central Park, we haven\\'t slept. You\\'ve... You\\'ve always had a touch of the poet in you. Really? I\\'m not like them... What could I do? I had to choose. As my brother in law says: \"Alternatives exclude.\" Yeah, I loved you and I loved Phil. I was with him a year and a half... and you were this... awkward but adorable, frantic, young, romantic, trying to find yourself. And I had this big shot. It was difficult. I didn\\'t know if it would work out. I didn\\'t want to lose you both... I thought maybe... If you didn\\'t make it the way you wanted you\\'d be resentful and we\\'d be unhappy. Who knows? I never stopped thinking about you. Not for one day. I still dream about you. But... I\\'m Phil\\'s wife. And he\\'s been very good to me. And he loves me and he\\'s changed his life for me. I\\'ve been a good wife to him. Yet you dream about me. You\\'re a happily married man with a child. - You said it yourself. - I know what I said. But we are alone in Central Park. The light\\'s reflecting off the building. Satisfied? As the investigation into Ben proceeded... there was no shortage of evidence or informants. and indictments followed, including murder one. I can\\'t get my mind around it. The whole thing is so horrible. I am firmly against all execution. Thank God, they never found the neighbors body. What difference does that make? We may not be criminally liable but we have to live with our conscious. I only said Ben should talk to him! Don\\'t be naive. You wanted him threatened! Warned! I wanted him warned! What difference does that make? Your brother... Don\\'t keep on me Leonard. Somebody had to deal with that crazy next door... It was becoming intolerable. You don\\'t kill a man because he plays his radio too loud! Calm down. She did not realise, and they have enough on Ben without your neighbor. This is a different issue. Meanwhile, there is a blood sin on our hands. Oh Christ! Don\\'t get so biblical. Evelyn, calm down. Take an aspirin. I\\'m going to give you the name of a very good criminal lawyer, Jake Murray. He\\'s the best you can do. Thank you so much. She is devastated. I think she\\'ll have a nervous breakdown. She\\'s driving me crazy. As if I\\'m not upset enough. What did you think, Rose? Everybody seemed to know he was involved in shady activities. I don\\'t believe he killed anybody. My father always knew he was a wheeler-dealer but as details come out it gets worse and worse. What we need is a great criminal lawyer and I know just the guy... my old pal Peter Bryce. Not Jake Murray? Bryce never loses, but if you like Murray we\\'ll get him as well.. I don\\'t know if Bryce can get him to walk but the trick now is to spare him the electric chair. The trial went as anticipated. The evidence against Ben Dorfman was overwhelming. He was found guilty on all charges, including murder in the first degree. Despite the efforts of two high priced lawyers, he was sentenced to die in the electric chair at Sing Sing. This is Father Brolian. He\\'s guiding me to understand Christianity. Today we discussed the sixth psalm... \"Oh Lord, do not punish me in anger... \"Do not chastise me in fury.\" That right Father? I\\'m flabbergasted. We both didn\\'t have time for this bullshit but when the end is near you need something. You don\\'t want to be buried as a Jew in a Jewish cemetery? The Jewish religion doesn\\'t believe in an afterlife. I guess but I can\\'t believe what I\\'m hearing. I have to know it all doesn\\'t just end. I have to believe part of me keeps going. We all got a soul. Right Father? First a murderer, then he becomes a Christian. What did I do to deserve this? Which is worse? He explained it to you... The Jews don\\'t have an afterlife. We\\'re all afraid of dying Marty. But we don\\'t give up the religion we\\'re born into. I\\'m not afraid of dying. You\\'re too stupid to appreciate the implications. I didn\\'t say I like the idea. And I\\'ll resist death with everything I have. But when the Angel of Death comes with his scythe to cut me down, I\\'ll go. I\\'ll protest. I\\'ll curse. You hear me? I\\'ll go under protest! Protest to who? What the hell you gonna do? Write a letter to The Times? I\\'ll protest in silence! I\\'ll protest because my whole life... I pray and I pray, and there\\'s never an answer! What are you saying? No answer is also an answer. Too bad the Jewish religion doesn\\'t have an afterlife. They would get a lot more customers. In late July, Ben was executed at Sing Sing. He died a Christian and stated he wanted to be cremated. Ben requested his ashes be scattered in Manhattan. And Bobby scattered them outside an establishment that had given Ben many evenings of pleasure. Bobby\\'s friends, Rad Taylor and her husband, stepped up to help Bobby. and arranged financially to take over the club and run it. And the scandal of its gangster charisma... increased the public\\'s fascination with it. Certain investors asked them to go out to California, and explore the idea of opening a nightclub in Hollywood. This time he could afford to stay at the same exclusive place where Rad and Steve always stopped at. Of course, he looked up Vonnie. This is the exact table where I took your hand... and you told me you had a journalist boyfriend named Doug. I remember. So will you open a club here? No, Hollywood already has its great clubs. I don\\'t want to compete with the Cocoanut Grove. Phil and I will be stopping in New York for a brief time on the way back from London, we\\'re going to spend Christmas week with Willie Wyler. The boys want to go to this New Years Eve party in New York so... I guess I won\\'t be seeing you. Maybe it\\'s just as well we don\\'t...see each other. It always... stirs up feelings and... I start dreaming... You probably start dreaming. And dreams are... they\\'re dreams. I guess some feelings never die. Is that good or bad? And as a beautiful dusk sky enveloped New York... the year came to a close. How do I look? Wow, beautiful! Can you tell I\\'m pregnant? No, not at all! In fact you have the same girlish figure you always had. It\\'s true. Here, help me. Can I ask you a question? You ever cheated on me? Why would you ask that? No. I had a dream that when you were in Hollywood, you slept with your old girlfriend who has my name. Dreams are dreams. This is the happiest couple I know... It\\'s a perfect marriage. Tell us please, what is your secret? What is our secret? You tell them... We share the same interests... like the same movies, we both love children... - Other peoples! - Ok! Time flies, another milestone... on a bewildering journey leading where? And why? It\\'s been an awful year. Lets turn the page and move on. You\\'re right, you\\'re right. I was pondering the relentlessness of time. Socrates said: \"The unexamined life is not worth living.\" But the examined one is no bargain. 10 ! 9 ! 8 ! Happy New Year! - Happy New Year. - You too. I love you. Happy New Year. You too. Happy New Year, Bobby! You have that far-out look in your eye. - Do I? - What are you thinking? Nothing. Just that er... the year is changing. It is! Happy New Year my love. You make every year a new and happy year for me. Thank you, that\\'s very sweet. What are you thinking? Nothing, I\\'m fine. Your eyes look so dreamy.'\n",

      " 'Joaquin ”El Chapo” Guzmán had seen his name in headlines. He knew it graced the world’s Most Wanted lists. But it appears that the notorious drug kingpin wanted something more: He wanted his name in lights. Guzmán was recaptured by the Mexican government on Friday, and has been returned to the same prison he broke out of in July. Mexican authorities tracked him down in the seaside city of Los Mochis thanks in part to Guzmán’s desire to make a biopic about his life, Mexico’s attorney general says. The druglord had contacted actors and producers, Arely Gomez says, opening a line of investigation that helped Mexican marines ultimately capture the fugitive. Guzman’s life is certainly dramatic enough for the big screen. In fact, a film based on his story  —   Chapo: El Escape del Siglo, or Chapo: The Escape of the Century  —   is set to open in Mexico next week. And a less glamorous video of his July escape has already seized the attention of the world, as Bill and Laura reported yesterday: ”Surveillance video shot by a security camera in Guzmán’s cell showed one of the world’s most notorious criminals pacing around before dropping behind a partition in the shower area of his cell. ”That cell was in the Altiplano prison, a maximum security facility about 55 miles from Mexico City. Guzmán spent less than 18 months there before his accomplices used a nearly   tunnel to ferry him to freedom. ”Before he was captured in February of 2014, Guzmán had been on the lam since 2001  —   when he escaped from another maximum security prison that was reportedly nearly identical to the one he broke out of last year.” After his 2001 escape, the head of the Sinaloa Cartel ”managed to outmaneuver, outfight or   his rivals to stay at the top of the business for over a decade,” as Reuters put it. This time around, he had months, not years, of freedom. Mexican forces first located Guzmán in October, but he escaped in part because Mexican marines held their fire at the sight of two women and a child with him, Mexican attorney general Arely Gomez said Friday. Officials then tracked Guzmán to Los Mochis, with help from his   dreams and information from one of his tunnel builders, the Associated Press reports. They narrowed his location down to one house in an upscale neighborhood, and moved in early Friday, the wire service says: ”Five suspects were killed and six others arrested. One marine was injured. ” ’You could hear intense gunfire and a helicopter it was fierce,’ said a neighbor, adding that the battle raged for three hours, starting at 4 a. m. She refused to be quoted by name in fear for her own safety. ”Gomez said Guzman and his security chief, ’El Cholo’ Ivan Gastelum, were able to flee via storm drains and escape through a manhole cover to the street, where they commandeered getaway cars. Marines climbed into the drains in pursuit. They closed in on the two men based on reports of stolen vehicles and they were arrested on the highway.” Now Guzmán is back at the Altiplano   prison  —   the site of his July escape. The U. S. has a standing request for Guzmán to be transferred to the States, where he faces drug trafficking charges. Many are calling for that extradition to happen, and quickly. On Friday, Mexican authorities said nothing about extraditing the escape artist to America.'\n",

      " \"Graph self-supervised learning has gained increasing attention due to its\\ncapacity to learn expressive node representations. Many pretext tasks, or loss\\nfunctions have been designed from distinct perspectives. However, we observe\\nthat different pretext tasks affect downstream tasks differently cross\\ndatasets, which suggests that searching pretext tasks is crucial for graph\\nself-supervised learning. Different from existing works focusing on designing\\nsingle pretext tasks, this work aims to investigate how to automatically\\nleverage multiple pretext tasks effectively. Nevertheless, evaluating\\nrepresentations derived from multiple pretext tasks without direct access to\\nground truth labels makes this problem challenging. To address this obstacle,\\nwe make use of a key principle of many real-world graphs, i.e., homophily, or\\nthe principle that ``like attracts like,'' as the guidance to effectively\\nsearch various self-supervised pretext tasks. We provide theoretical\\nunderstanding and empirical evidence to justify the flexibility of homophily in\\nthis search task. Then we propose the AutoSSL framework which can automatically\\nsearch over combinations of various self-supervised tasks. By evaluating the\\nframework on 7 real-world datasets, our experimental results show that AutoSSL\\ncan significantly boost the performance on downstream tasks including node\\nclustering and node classification compared with training under individual\\ntasks.

      " ' Hillary Clinton is overwhelmingly likely to win the Democratic nomination, but it’s been close. So far she’s taken 1, 768 delegates in primaries and caucuses, while Bernie Sanders has secured 1, 497.    The same can’t be said for the   ”invisible primary”: the contest for top endorsements, institutional backing, and key staffers. According to FiveThirtyEight’s endorsement tracker, Clinton is routing Sanders among party elites: 511 members of Congress or governors have endorsed Clinton; only 13 have endorsed Sanders. So while Sanders has 85 percent as many pledged delegates as Clinton, he has only 2. 5 percent as many endorsements from top elected officials. When Sanders complains that the Democratic establishment is in Clinton’s corner, this is the establishment he means. As my colleagues Matt Yglesias and Jeff Stein wrote, ”Party elites  —   including leaders of interest groups whose agenda Sanders has always consistently supported  —   really have worked against Sanders. Not by cheating, but by exercising the normal channels of influence that influential political actors have at their disposal.” (The one exception to the ”normal channels of influence” here was the Democratic National Committee’s scheduling of debates to help Clinton, which really was deplorable.)    There are two ways of reading the establishment’s preference of Clinton. One  —   the reading Sanders and many of his supporters prefer  —   is that it’s evidence the game was rigged from the start.    The other reading, however, is that the Democratic establishment’s preference for Clinton wasn’t inevitable  —   it emerged from strategic choices that both Sanders and Clinton made; choices that helped and hurt them in different ways, and that foretell the kind of president each would be. Bernie Sanders didn’t lose the establishment. He rejected it. Party elites are a constituency like any other, and Clinton campaigned hard for their support. Hell, she’s spent decades campaigning hard for their support. She’s been sending holiday cards to their kids, showing up at their fundraisers, working with them on their bills, meeting with them on their priorities. This is the kind of politics both Clintons excel at.    This is not Sanders’s kind of politics, and that’s putting it mildly. And it’s not because he’s an ”outsider.” Sanders has served in Congress for decades, but he hasn’t invested the same kind of time into winning over interest groups and forging deep relationships with his fellow senators. I remember asking a legislator who frequently voted with Sanders who the Vermonter’s close friends were in the chamber. He got very uncomfortable. Sanders just isn’t a     kind of politician. The results are evident. Clinton, for instance, racked up the endorsements of Vermont’s other senator and its governor  —   even though Sanders overwhelmingly beat Clinton among Vermont’s voters.             But the difference runs deeper than personality  —   it springs from both strategy and ideology. Until this election cycle, Sanders wasn’t actually a Democrat. And he was always honest that his refusal to join the party was a criticism of its leadership and its direction. In an interview with Vox, he made the argument clearly:     The Democrats, to a much too great degree, are separated from working families. Are the Democrats 10 times, 100 times, better on all of the issues than the Republicans? They surely are, but I think it would be hard to imagine if you walked out of here or walked down the street or went a few miles away from here and you stopped somebody on the street and you said, ”Do you think that the Democratic Party is the party of the American working class?” People would look at you and say, ”What are you talking about?” There was a time  —   I think under Roosevelt, maybe even under Truman  —   where it was perceived that working people were part of the Democratic Party. I think for a variety of reasons, a lot having to do with money and politics, that is no longer the case.  Sanders has benefited mightily from this argument and the credibility he’s built by making it. In an   year, His political independence has been core to his brand. He wins   independents frustrated with the Democratic Party because, like them, he’s a   independent frustrated with the Democratic Party. This is the case for Sanders: He isn’t like those other Democrats, he isn’t tied to their institutions or dependent on their funders, and so he won’t betray you the way they have. It’s a way he differs not just from Hillary Clinton but also, implicitly, from Barack Obama. How Sanders 2016 is different from Obama 2008 Clinton’s margin among Democratic elites wasn’t inevitable, and her advantage wasn’t immutable. She started 2008 as the candidate of the Democratic establishment, too, but Obama wooed much of it back from her  —   he got endorsements from key members of Congress like Ted Kennedy and John Lewis, he won over major interest groups like the   and he signed up top policy talent everyone thought would side with Clinton. Obama’s ability to work with the power centers of the Democratic Party was part of the case his campaign mounted for why he would be a better president than Hillary Clinton: It showed, the campaign said, that he could play both the inside game and the outside game better than she could.             But this spoke to a deep difference between Obama and Sanders’s campaigns. Both ran on a critique of a dysfunctional, even corrupt, political system. But Obama believed in an inside game, while Sanders thinks the very existence of an inside game is part of the problem. Obama’s argument was that he would fix the system through dialogue and compromise; Sanders’s argument is that he’ll overwhelm the system with outside activists, ameliorating the need for compromise with Republicans and moneyed interests.    ”The major political, strategic difference I have with Obama,” Sanders told Vox in 2014, ”is it’s too late to do anything inside the Beltway. You gotta take your case to the American people, mobilize them, and organize them at the grassroots level in a way that we have never done before.” This is Sanders’s critique of Obama: He thinks Obama was captured by the existing power centers and funders of the Democratic Party, and it led him to abandon the outside game and turn to an inside game. In Sanders’s view, Obama let his grassroots army wither while he cut deals with the insurance industry to pass Obamacare. Sanders has no intention of making the same mistake, and that’s part of the reason his supporters love him. Clinton and Sanders offer two very different theories of how to be a successful president In contrast to Sanders, Clinton’s mastery of the inside game is core to her appeal. Part of how the president gets anything done is winning over his party’s elected officials, interest groups, and assorted other power brokers. Jimmy Carter, for instance, was famously disliked by congressional Democrats, and it hamstrung his agenda. By contrast, Obama was able to get every single Senate Democrat to vote for Obamacare, and it’s the sole reason the law passed.             The skill Clinton is demonstrating in rolling up the entirety of the Democratic establishment, in other words, is deeply relevant to the presidency. The case for Clinton is that she understands how to work the system we have; the case for Sanders is he won’t be corrupted by the system we have, and he’ll do his best to turn it into the system liberals want. Which vision you view as more realistic will likely drive which candidate you support. But this is why it’s confusing to hear Sanders complain that the Democratic establishment has opposed him at every step. He made a choice to distance himself from the Democratic Party establishment, and he’s developed a theory of politics that requires him to retain that distance. Over decades, Sanders repeatedly dissed one constituency (Democratic elites) in order to appeal to another constituency (voters who mistrust the Democratic Party). Clinton made the opposite choice. The result is that Clinton benefited from the support of Democratic elites and Sanders benefited from his reputation for independence from Democratic elites. '\n",

(a) There was certain adverse information used by the Tribunal to affirm the decision under review and the Tribunal did not disclose the information in accordance with s 424A(1).The appeal is, with respect, without substance and should be dismissed.7 Section 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) provides as follows:  Information and invitation given in writing by Tribunal  (1) Subject to subsections (2A) and (3), the Tribunal must:  (a) give to the applicant, in the way that the Tribunal considers appropriate in the circumstances, clear particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review; and  (b) ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that the applicant understands why it is relevant to the review, and the consequences of it being relied on in affirming the decision that is under review; and  (c) invite the applicant to comment on or respond to it.(2) The information and invitation must be given to the applicant:  (a) except where paragraph (b) applies--by one of the methods specified in section 441A ; or  (b) if the applicant is in immigration detention--by a method prescribed for the purposes of giving documents to such a person.(2A) The Tribunal is not obliged under this section to give particulars of information to an applicant, nor invite the applicant to comment on or respond to the information, if the Tribunal gives clear particulars of the information to the applicant, and invites the applicant to comment on or respond to the information, under section 424AA.(3) This section does not apply to information:  (a) that is not specifically about the applicant or another person and is just about a class of persons of which the applicant or other person is a member; or   (b) that the applicant gave for the purpose of the application for review; or  (ba) that the applicant gave during the process that led to the decision that is under review, other than such information that was provided orally by the applicant to the Department; or   (c) that is non-disclosable information.8 The appeal is considered to be without substance for either of two reasons.9 First, the \" certain adverse information used by the Tribunal \" has not been identified.The proceedings before the Tribunal did not involve, as do many applications for review, an assessment of competing accounts of factual events.The Tribunal in the present proceedings had limited information available to it and, recognising that there was no onus of proof upon the now Appellants, simply concluded that:  ...The information that the first named applicant has submitted does not provide the necessary detail for the Tribunal to be satisfied as to the veracity of his claims or that he has a well founded fear of persecution. Section 424A , it may be accepted, imposes a mandatory requirement: SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 at [77] per McHugh J, at [173] per Kirby J, at [208] per Hayne J, [2005] HCA 24 ; 228 CLR 294.But no breach can be established unless the particular \" information \" which it is claimed needs to be the subject of an invitation to comment upon or respond to can be first identified.10 The First Appellant appeared unrepresented before this Court this morning but did have the benefit of an interpreter.Other than expressing a desire to stay longer in Australia, he provided no assistance as to the \" certain adverse information \" to which his Notice of Appeal refers.Indeed, it was unclear whether the complaint was directed to the use of information already provided or whether the complaint was more directed to the lack of an opportunity to provide further information.If the latter, it is considered that adequate opportunity has already been extended in which to provide information.11 Second, the \" information \" considered by the Tribunal and the \" information \" which it ultimately considered did not make out the Applicant\\'s case was that in fact supplied by the Applicant.Such \" information \" is not \" information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review \" within the meaning of s 424A(1)(a).12 The contents of such \" information \", as was observed in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [17] , [2007] FCA 26 ; 235 ALR 609 at 615 by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ, \" if ... believed ... would, one might have thought, have been a relevant step towards rejecting, not affirming, the decision under review .\" Moreover, it was the inadequacy of the materials provided by the now Appellants that was the \" reason \" for the Tribunal\\'s decision.Where it is the Tribunal\\'s \" disbelief of the appellant\\'s evidence arising from inconsistencies therein, it is difficult to see how such disbelief could be characterised as constituting \\'information\\' within the meaning of para (a) of s 424A(1) \": SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [18] , [2007] FCA 26 ; 235 ALR 609 at 616.13 No question arises in the present proceedings of the Tribunal ascribing to particular information provided by an applicant a significance or relevance of which an applicant may have been unaware: VAF v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 123 at [26] ---[28], [2004] FCAFC 123 ; 206 ALR 471 at 477---8 per Finn and Stone JJ.And no question arises as to a particular significance or relevance being attached to \" information \" provided to the Tribunal, as opposed to \" information \" provided for the purposes of the visa application: Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Al Shamry [2001] FCA 919 , 110 FCR 27.The \" reason \" for the Tribunal\\'s decision was simply the inadequacy of any of the materials provided by the now Appellant.The Tribunal thus concluded:   The mere fact that a person claims a fear of persecution for a particular reason does not establish the genuineness of the asserted fear or that it is \"well founded\" or is for the reason claimed.It remains for the first named applicant to satisfy the Tribunal that all of the statutory elements are made out.Although the concept of onus of proof is not appropriate to administrative inquiries and decision-making the relevant facts of the individual case will have to be supplied by the applicants themselves in as much detail as is necessary to enable the decision maker to establish the relevant facts.The Tribunal is not required to make the applicants\\' case for them.Nor is the Tribunal required to accept uncritically any and all of the allegations made by applicants.( MIEA v Guo &amp; Anor [1997] HCA 22 ; (1997) 191 CLR 559 at 596, Nagalingam v MILGEA [1992] FCA 470 ; (1992) 38 FCR 191 , Prasad v MIEA [1985] FCA 47 ; (1985) 6 FCR 155 at 169-70.) The first named applicant did not attend the hearing and this leaves the Tribunal with claims which are untested and stated in the most general terms.The Tribunal was unable to explore with the first named applicant who the \"antisocial elements\\' were that threatened him, when he was threatened, how he was threatened, whether he reported the threats to the police and, if so, what action the police took, who the people were he suspects attacked him, when he was attacked, how he was attacked, whether there were any witnesses present, whether he reported the attack to the police and, if so, what action the police took, whether he had considered relocation within India and what is likely to happen to him if he were to return to India in the foreseeable future.The information that the first named applicant has submitted does not provide the necessary detail for the Tribunal to be satisfied as to the veracity of his claims or that he has a well founded fear of persecution.Further the Tribunal has not been able to discuss with the first named applicant independent country information which may be relevant to his particular claims.In these circumstances the Tribunal is unable to be satisfied that the first named applicant has a well founded fear of persecution for reasons of his political opinion or any other Convention based reason.14 No question of any breach of s 424A , in such circumstances, arises for resolution: SZIDH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCA 369.In the present case, as in SZEFM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 78:   [23] ...the Tribunal was identifying the deficiencies or inadequacies in the appellant\\'s case.It was not relying on information communicated to or received by the Tribunal but setting out its thought processes.There was no information that the Tribunal was obliged to give to the appellant by reason of s 424A(1).... 15 As in SZEZI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1195 the applicant for the visa did not attend before the Tribunal, despite an invitation to do so.Allsop J there concluded:  [29] ...The reason for the decision was simply (and no more than) the evaluative conclusion founded on the perceived inadequacy of the information, in the sense of an absence of detail and extrinsic explanation which had been invited.It would be an inadequate and misleading statement to say that the information was the reason or part of the reason for the decision.It was the lack of the requested further assistance and explanation that was the reason.The same comment may be made in the present appeal.16 The appeal should thus be dismissed.ORDERS  17 The orders of the Court are: 1.Appeal dismissed.2.The Appellants to pay the costs of the First Respondent of and incidental to the appeal.I certify that the preceding seventeen (17) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Flick.Associate:Dated: 3 March 2008 The First Appellant: Self-represented   Solicitor for the Respondent: M Mafessanti (Clayton Utz)   Date of Hearing: 3 March 2008   Date of Judgment: 3 March 2008    AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback  URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2008/210.html   '\n",

Account Name: Principality of Camside  &#8226; Account Number: 3162 1027 8861 ...\" 2 On 23 December 2005, APRA obtained a further ex parte order from Merkel J which restrained Mr Siminton from leaving Australia and required him to deliver up his passport.3 On 10 January 2006 APRA sought interlocutory relief against Mr Siminton.After a contested hearing, Gray J made various interlocutory orders which included Order 1 (e) which restrained Mr Siminton \"whether by himself his servants or agents or otherwise\" from:  \"dealing with, withdrawing or disposing of, or giving any instructions in relation to the disposition or transfer of, all or any part of the moneys standing to the credit of the respondent and/or his nominee in any account (whether held alone, jointly or in conjunction with any other person, including any accounts or property in the name of the Principality of Camside or the Terra Nova Cache and any account in relation to which the Respondent is a signatory or which the Respondent otherwise has authority to operate, whether or not the Respondent is named as an account holder and any account which may be operated for the benefit of the Respondent, the Principality of Camside or the Terra Nova Cache) in any bank, building society or other financial institution and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, account number 3162 1027 8861 in the name of the Principality of Camside with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia ...\" 4 There was a proviso to his Honour\\'s order under which Mr Siminton could have access to some of the funds to which the order would otherwise have prevented him from obtaining access.The proviso was in these terms:  \"2.The respondent have liberty to apply on 2 days notice in writing to the Applicant, supported by an Affidavit as to his means, for an order that he be permitted to withdraw monies for the purposes of paying his own living expenses and/or paying his legal expenses in relation to the proceeding.\" Mr Siminton was present in Court when Gray J made these orders.5 On 29 December 2005, 4 January 2006 and on 19 January 2006 APRA filed notices of motion and statements of charge seeking orders that Mr Siminton be punished for contempt in respect of nine alleged breaches of the orders made by Sundberg J.The contempt charges were heard on 29 March 2006 and, on 30 March 2006, Merkel J found that Mr Siminton had committed contempt by breaching certain of the orders made by Sundberg J on 15 December 2006: see [2006] FCA 326.These included various contraventions of Order 2 (b) of his Honour\\'s orders.6 On 10 April 2006 Merkel J ordered that Mr Siminton be imprisoned in respect of the various contempts: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No.3) (2006) 230 ALR 528.7 Mr Siminton lodged an appeal against the findings and orders made by Merkel J.His appeal was allowed in part because the sealed copy of the orders made by Sundberg J, although personally served on Mr Siminton, had not contained the endorsement required by Order 37 Rule 2 of the Federal Court Rules .The order that Mr Siminton be imprisoned was set aside.The Full Court, nonetheless, upheld Merkel J\\'s findings that Mr Siminton had been guilty of contempt and substituted a penalty of $50,000: see Siminton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2006] FCAFC 118 ; (2006) 152 FCR 129.8 The question of whether the necessary endorsement appeared on the copy of the orders which was served on Mr Siminton was raised by a member of the Court on the first day of the hearing of the appeal --- 5 May 2006.APRA noted that the copy of Gray J\\'s orders which had been served on Mr Siminton also lacked the endorsement.As a result a further copy of Gray J\\'s orders, which contained the endorsement, was served on Mr Siminton on 9 May 2006.This date is of significance because some of the conduct which is the subject of the present charges occurred shortly before the hearing of the appeal commenced and before the amended orders were served on Mr Siminton.THE STATEMENTS OF CHARGE  9 All of the charges allege contraventions of para 1(e) of the Orders made by Gray J on 10 January 2006.Some of the charges are laid as alternatives.Each of the charges alleges that, at some time between 2 May 2006 and 28 September 2006, Mr Siminton transferred, disposed of or, alternatively, dealt with moneys standing to his credit, the credit of the Principality of Camside and/or the credit of two persons whom it is alleged were Mr Siminton\\'s nominees.Shortly put, APRA submits that Mr Siminton breached Gray J\\'s Order and sought to conceal those breaches by transferring moneys to a credit card account operated by a third party and using a credit card which bore the third party\\'s name as if it were his own.10 The evidence relied on by APRA was contained in a series of affidavits (together with the exhibits referred to in those affidavits).The affidavits were those of:  &#8226;

and     ii.$5468.96.\"  13 In paras 52 to 59 of its written submissions,APRA set out the matters it says are established by the evidence in respect of charge 1.1:   \"52.On 2 May 2006, Mr Siminton effected or gave instructions in relation to the transfer of $5760.30 standing to the credit of Mr Siminton and/or the Principality of Camside with Mobile EFT Pty Ltd, to a Visa card account in the name of Dale and Karen M Holzheimer held at the Adelaide Bank.  53.The total sum of $5760.30 was transferred, alternatively disposed of, on 2 May 2006 in two amounts comprising:        53.1 $291.34; and  53.2 $5468.96.      54.At all relevant times Mr Siminton operated an electronic banking facility with Mobile EFT Pty Ltd (the Camside Account).  55.On 2 May 2006 the amounts listed in paragraph 53 were transferred from the Camside Account.  56.The corresponding credit entry to the Visa Account is recorded at page 71 in Annexure \"HJG(9)\" to the Goodliffe affidavit.The Visa Account statement shows credits for 2 May 2006 of $291.34 and $5468.96.  57.The Applicant submits that the transfer of $5760.30 from the Camside Account to the Visa account was deliberate.Mr Siminton had previously attempted to transfer money under his control into the Visa Account.  58.Further, the Applicant submits that Mr Siminton, or a person acting on his instructions, made the transfer.  59.The conclusion that Mr Siminton deliberately effected, or gave instruction in relation to the transfer of $5760.30 from the Camside Account to the Visa Account is the only rational inference to be drawn from the evidence.Any alternative hypothesis could not be regarded as reasonable in the absence of evidence to support hypothesis when that evidence, if it exists at all, must be within the knowledge of Mr Siminton.\"   Charge 1.2  14 Charge 1.2 alleges that Mr Siminton:  \"... by himself or by his servants or agents, gave instructions for the transfer, alternatively the disposition, of monies totalling $3125.88 and standing to the credit of the Principality of Camside into the Visa Account.The total sum of $3125.88 was transferred on 3 May 2006 in two amounts comprising:   i.$382.06;

[I interpolate at this point that 11 April 2006 was the day after Merkel J sentenced Mr Siminton for having breached orders made by Sundberg J]  84.A replacement Visa credit card, number 4564 3679 0031 1427, was issued to Karen Holzheimer on 11 April 2006 and sent to her in Queensland by registered post on 12 April 2006.  85.Each of the 31 transactions listed in paragraph 82 above was made using Visa card number 4564 3679 0031 1427 issued to Karen Holzheimer on 11 April 2006.  86.At no stage after 11 April 2006 did Dale Holzheimer or Karen Holzheimer report either that their:      86.1 credit cards attached to the Visa Account had been lost;  86.2 credit cards attached to the Visa Account had been misused; or  86.3 Visa Account had been incorrectly billed.     87.The Adelaide Bank froze the Visa Account on 15 September 2006 in order to protect its interests and to ensure that the cards attached to the Visa Account were not being misused.  88.Karen Holzheimer made no complaint to the Adelaide Bank that the Visa Account had been frozen --- she merely requested that the fact be confirmed in writing.  89.The Applicant has obtained the credit card vouchers for each of the 31 transactions listed in paragraph 82.The credit card vouchers are the slips presented by a merchant to a customer to sign in order to authorise a transaction.In most cases the date of an actual transaction on a credit card voucher will be earlier than the date recorded on the credit card statement due to processing delays.  90.The individual credit card vouchers for the 31 transactions are annexed to the affidavits of Heather Joy Goodliffe dated 14 December 2006 (reference HJG(X) and Angelo Fonti dated 14 December 2006 (reference AF-X) as follows:    Transaction number   Transaction Amount   Transaction date   Visa Account  statement reference   Credit card voucher reference   1   $45.20   6 May 2006   HJG(9): page 72   AF-7   2   $218.40   21 May 2006   HJG(9): page 73   AF-13   3   $172.90   4 June 20066   HJG(9): page 77   AF-13   4   $131.60   6 June 2006   HJG(9): page 77   AF-8   5   $155.78   9 June 2006   HJG(9): page 77   AF-4   6   $16.80   11 June 2006   HJG(9): page 77   AF-7   7   $128.05   24 June 2006   HJG(9): page 78)   AF-4   8   $74.00   24 June 2006   HJG(9): page 78   AF-8   9   $29.85   28 June 2006   HJG(9): page 78   HJG(10) page 10   10   $121.50   28 June 2006   HJG(9): page 78   AF-13   11   $132.79   30 June 2006   HJG(9): page 81   AF-4   12   $96.00   1 July 2006   HJG(9): page 81   AF-8   13   $29.85   5 July 2006   HJG(9): page 81   AF-12   14   $127.65   7 July 2006   HJG(9): page 8   AF-5   15   $65.00   8 July 2006   HJG(9): page 82   AF-10   16   $130.45   9 July 2006   HJG(9): page 82   HJG(10) page 3   17   $85.60   11 July 2006   HJG(9): page 82   AF-10   18   $41.00   11 July 2006   HJG(9): page 82   AF-8   19   $51.00   12 July 2006   HJG(9): page 82   HJG(10) page 5   20   $121.59   14 July 2006   HJG(9): page 82   AF-5   21   $140.37   20 July 2006   HJG(9): page 82   AF-5   22   $77.50   26 July 2006   HJG(9): page 82   HJG(1) page 6   23   $46.60   27 July 2006   HJG(9): page 83   AF-10   24   $55.00   27 July 2006   HJG(9): page 83   AF-6   25   $143.18   29 July 2006   HJG(9): page 85   HJG(10)   26   $90.00   29 July 2006   HJG(9): page 85   AF-8   27   $21.80   30 July 2006   HJG(9): page 85   HJG(10) page 8   28   $74.60   1 August 2006   HJG(9): page 85   AF-10   29   $56.00   2 August 2006   HJG(9): page 85   HJG(10) page 9   30   $132.61   4 August 2006   HJG(9): page 85   AF-5   31   $74.60   6 August 2006   HJG(9): page 85   AF-10     91.The Applicant has had the signatures on each of the credit card vouchers for the 31 transactions listed in paragraph 90 above compared to the signature of Mr Siminton by a handwriting expert.  92.The handwriting expert has expressed the opinion that the signatures on the credit card vouchers for the 31 transactions listed in paragraph 90 above are those of Mr Siminton.  [I interpolate at this point that the credit card vouchers were not signed \"D or K Holzheimer\" but appear to bear Mr Siminton\\'s own signature.The card was used at restaurants to purchase food and beverages and at shops.]  93.Further, there are other transactions in the period 2 May to 16 August which, although not the subject of contempt charges, appear specifically to relate to Mr Siminton.APRA submits the Court can use this additional evidence to assist it in drawing the inference that the Visa account was being used by Mr Siminton as principal, for his own purposes, and that the use of an account and card in Karen Holzheimer\\'s name was nothing more than an attempt to disguise the fact that Mr Siminton was accessing funds in breach of the Orders.

Austria.       104.APRA submits that the transfer of $24,981 from the Anglo-Irish Bank account to the Visa Account was deliberate.The account at the Anglo-Irish Bank is in Mr Siminton\\'s name.Mr Siminton has previously used the Anglo-Irish Bank account to pay for investments in Australia.      105.Further, APRA submits the Court can infer that Mr Siminton, or a person acting on Mr Siminton\\'s instructions, made the transfer.The evidence discloses that he was the person who had authority to operate that account.      106.The conclusion that Mr Siminton deliberately effected, or gave instructions in relation to the transfer of $24,981 from the Anglo-Irish Bank to the Visa Account is the only rational inference to be drawn from the evidence.Any alternative hypothesis could not be regarded as reasonable in the absence of evidence to support that hypothesis when that evidence, if it exists at all, must be within the knowledge of Mr Siminton.\"     Charge 1.10  30 Charge 1.10

 44.2 both participated in and spoke at seminars that Mr Siminton ran in Queensland promoting the Terra Nova Cache bank; and  44.3 was a contact point for depositors in the Terra Nova Cache bank.      45.Dale and Karen M Holzheimer opened the Visa account in April 2002.      46.The residential address given for the Holzheimer\\'s in the application for the Visa credit card was 12 Aquamarine Street, Springfield, Qld 4300.      47.All of the Visa Account statements were sent to addresses in Queensland.      48.All of the transactions listed in para 82 [set out above at [23]] took place in Victoria.      49.At all relevant times Mr Siminton was resident in Victoria.      50.At no stage did Dale or Karen Holzheimer request that an additional credit card be issued on the Visa Account for use by Mr Siminton.      51.The terms and conditions of use of the Visa Account forbade the use of the credit card by anyone other than the person named on the card.\"  37 The account from which the payments which are the subject of charges 1.1 to 1.5 were made was a Mobile EFT account.It had been opened by Mr Siminton in March 2000 as the Australian representative of a business named \"Synchronistic Corporation\".In 2003 Mr Siminton changed the trading name of the account to \"HM Government of Camside\".Mobile EFT is a service which allows merchants to accept credit cards from customers.Once the customer\\'s account has been debited the funds are transferred from their financial institution to Mobile EFT and, after about eight days, the money is then credited to the merchant\\'s nominated bank account.When the account was opened Mr Siminton nominated a Commonwealth Bank account as that into which payment was to be made.He subsequently varied that direction.On 13 February 2006, about a month after Gray J made his orders, Mr Siminton changed the nominated account for receipt of funds from the Principality of Camside\\'s Mobile EFT account to the Holzheimer\\'s Visa account at the Bank of Adelaide.The only person who was nominated as the owner of the \"HM Government of Camside\" business in the documents completed by Mr Siminton was Mr Siminton himself.It was he who established the merchant account and it was he who, from time to time gave instructions to vary the arrangements.38 As already noted some of the charges were laid in the alternative.Charge 1.7 is an alternative to Charge 1.6.Charge 1.8, in turn, was put as an alternative to Charge 1.7.Counsel for APRA advised the Court that if it found Charge 1.7 proven, APRA did not invite findings to be made in respect of Charges 1.6 and 1.8.For similar reasons APRA submitted that, if Charge 1.11 were found proven, it would not be necessary for the Court to make findings in relation to Charges 1.10 and 1.12.CONTEMPT  39 In Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v Design Elegance Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 83 ; (2006) 149 FCR 494 at 497-8 Merkel J summarised the current state of the law on when disobedience of a Court order will constitute a contempt of court.His Honour said:  \"Deliberate conduct which is in breach of a court order will constitute wilful disobedience of the order, and therefore a civil contempt, unless the conduct be casual, accidental or unintentional: see Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union v Mudginbeeri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 106-107 and 112-113.However, the disobedience will amount to a criminal contempt if it involves \\'deliberate defiance or, as it is sometimes said, if it is contumacious\\': see Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 530 ...However, as all proceedings for contempt are now regarded as criminal in nature, all of the charges must be proved beyond reasonable doubt: see Witham at 534.\" See also AMIEU v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 112-3; Heatons Transport v TGWU [1973] AC 15 at 109.40 In Advan Investments Pty Ltd v Dean Gleeson Motor Sales Pty Ltd [2003] VSC 201 Gillard J identified the elements which it is necessary for a complainant to establish in order to make good a charge of civil contempt of Court.His Honour said:   \"[31] In order to prove a civil contempt of Court involving a breach of an order of the Court, the plaintiff has to prove the following:        (i) that an order was made by the Court;  (ii) that the terms of the order are clear, unambiguous and capable of compliance;  (iii) that the order was served on the alleged contemnor or excused in the circumstances, or service dispensed with pursuant to the Rules of Court;  (iv) that the alleged contemnor has knowledge of the terms of the order;  (v) that the alleged contemnor has breached the terms of the order.     [32] It is necessary for the plaintiff to prove each element beyond reasonable doubt in accordance with the principles of the criminal law, in proving element (v) it must be proven that the act or omission which constituted the breach of the order was deliberate and voluntary.\" 41 There is no dispute, and I am satisfied that:   &#8226; Order 1(e) was made by Gray J on 10 January 2006.&#8226; A copy of Gray J\\'s orders was served on Mr Siminton on 23 January 2006.An amended copy of the orders was served on him on 9 May 2006.The relevant amendment was the inclusion of the endorsement required by Order 37 Rule 2(3) of the Federal Court Rules .&#8226; Mr Siminton had knowledge of the terms of the orders. Mr Siminton has put in issue the questions of whether Order 1(e) is clear and unambiguous, whether the Order has extra-territorial operation and whether APRA has established beyond reasonable doubt that he engaged in deliberate conduct which was in breach of Gray J\\'s orders.42 Before dealing with the principal issues in dispute I should note that Mr Siminton raised certain preliminary objections to the contempt charges being heard and determined before the principal application had been heard.He did not object to the contempt charges being heard immediately after the hearing of the principal application.As events transpired this is what occurred.There were other preliminary objections which can be grouped under two heads.The first was that, for a variety of reasons, provisions of the Act on which APRA relied in the principal proceeding were \"unconstitutional\".There was also an objection that the principal proceeding was an abuse of process and that it should permanently be stayed.I rejected these submissions for reasons which I gave when dealing with the principal proceeding: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 6) [2007] FCA 1608 at [7] to [27].In any event, these arguments cannot avail Mr Siminton in contempt proceedings.As the Full Court pointed out in Siminton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2006] FCAFC 118 ; (2006) 152 FCR 129 at 137-8:  \"An order made by a superior court of record stands and is bound to be observed even though it may ultimately be determined that the order should not have been made or was made without jurisdiction.Whilst the order stands, and it is not set aside, it must be observed and obeyed and any breach or contravention of such an order can give rise to a charge of contempt for failing to comply with it or observe it.\"  CLARITY OF ORDER 1(e)  43 Counsel for Mr Siminton sought to introduce expert evidence from a linguist as to how an ordinary person would construe the words \" the moneys standing to the credit of the respondent\" in Order 1(e).It was these moneys which Mr Siminton was prevented from dealing with.The expert opinion was that a reader of the order would understand it to apply to moneys which were in the relevant accounts on the date on which the order was made --- 10 January 2006 and not moneys thereafter added.I rejected the tender of this evidence because the proper construction of Order 1(e) was a matter of law, not a matter of fact: see Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman Networks Ltd [2006] FCAFC 41 ; (2006) 150 FCR 110 at 116.44 I allowed counsel to pursue an argument that, as a matter of law, the order was to be construed and understood in the manner contended for by the expert.As developed the submission was that \"the moneys\" was a reference to a definite article.When read in conjunction with \" standing \" the use of the present tense meant that the relevant moneys were those in the relevant accounts on 10 January 2006 rather than \"future moneys\" in \"future accounts\".45 Counsel for APRA submitted that Order 1(e) was properly to be construed as applying to any moneys standing to the credit of a relevant account during the currency of the order.Attention was directed to other parts of Gray J\\'s orders, for example, paras 1 (a), (b) and (c), which restrained Mr Siminton from doing things in the future.Counsel conceded that, if Mr Siminton\\'s construction argument succeeded, no contraventions of Order 1(e) could be established.46 It is trite law that injunctive orders of the Court \"should be granted in clear and unambiguous terms which leave no room for the persons to whom they are directed to wonder whether or not their future conduct falls within the scope or boundaries of the injunction: see ICA Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1992) 38 FCR 248 at 259 per Lockhart J, with whom Gummow and French JJ agreed.What is not as clear is what is comprehended, in the context, by the word \"unambiguous\" and what consequences flow from a finding of ambiguity if it is sought to enforce an order in proceedings for contempt.In Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Morgan [1965] HCA 21 ; (1965) 112 CLR 483 the appellant contended that, unless the language of an undertaking was unambiguous and certain, it should not be enforced by contempt proceedings.This submission was rejected by the Court.Barwick CJ said (at 492):  \"If the order or undertaking is so expressed as to be meaningless, there is of course nothing which can be enforced.But, if it bears a meaning which the Court is satisfied is one which ought fairly to have been in the contemplation of the person to whom the order was directed or who gave the undertaking as a possible meaning, the fact that that meaning results from a process of construction and involves a choice of possible meanings does not, in my opinion, preclude the Court from enforcing the order or undertaking in the sense in which the Court assigns to it.If the Court is satisfied that the party said to be in contempt bona fide believed himself bound only by a construction which the Court thinks to be erroneous, it may for that reason, in its discretion, refuse to make an order or, if it makes an order, refuse to make an order for costs against that party.But, even in such a case, the enforcement of the plaintiff\\'s rights must not be left out of account.A party who has bona fide acted on erroneous view of an order or undertaking may, according to the circumstances, nonetheless be justly adjudged guilty of contempt in procedure.In my opinion, this is equally so where, because of its terms or circumstances, the order or undertaking requires construction in order to determine its meaning and will move ambiguities patent or latent.\" 47 Windeyer J expressed a similar view (at 503):  \"This is not a case in which the extent of obligations undertaken is ascertainable simply by construing the undertaking according to ordinary grammatical rules.If that were so, I would agree that a mistake in construction could not excuse disobedience, although it might perhaps mitigate its consequences ...If its true meaning, although not immediately plain, can be ascertained according to ordinary rules of construction, then the person giving the undertaking is bound by it in that sense.That the uncertainties that lurk in the words of this undertaking, and which were exposed during the argument, cannot be resolved in that way, for they do not arise from a debatable construction but from an uncertain denotation.\" 48 In Universal Music Branson J (with whom Lindgren and Finkelstein JJ agreed), having referred to Morgan and a number of older authorities, concluded (at 119-120) that:  \"...the authorities discussed above reveal that an injunction is not rendered invalid, or incapable of founding a charge of contempt, merely because it leaves a respondent with room to wonder whether future conduct falls within it.At least where the true construction of the order is one which ought fairly to have been in the contemplation of the person to whom the order was directed ... the Court which entertains the charge of contempt will be required to determine that construction.Of course, it may be highly relevant to the question of punishment that a respondent failed to comply with the order because he, she or it placed a construction on the order that was not its true construction.\" 49 In my view the present case is one in which it is necessary for the Court to determine the true meaning of the order made by Gray J.The evident purpose of his Honour\\'s order was to prevent any dealings with the accounts operated and controlled by Mr Siminton or those associated with him pending the hearing and determination of the principal proceeding.It was for this reason that it was deemed necessary to make provision for Mr Siminton to obtain access to funds for living and legal expenses.This would not have been necessary had Mr Siminton had access to funds added to any of the accounts after 10 January 2006.It was reasonable to expect that account balances would change over the period during which the order was to be in force if only because of interest payments being credited and bank fees being debited.The construction contended for by Mr Siminton would have rendered his Honour\\'s orders progressively ineffective as the balances of the accounts covered by it changed after 10 January 2006.Had his Honour intended that his orders should have been so confined in their operation he would have inserted the words \"on 10 January 2006\" after \"nominee\".Order 1(e) is properly to be understood as applying to all moneys standing to the credit of the relevant accounts during the currency of the order.This construction is one that ought fairly to have been within Mr Siminton\\'s contemplation when Order 1(e) was made.50 I note that Order 1(e) is, relevantly, in identical terms to Order 2 (b) made by Sundberg J on 15 December 2005.When Mr Siminton was charged, before Merkel J, with having contravened this order he did not contend that it was ambiguous or uncertain or that he had not understood it.51 The question of whether or not Mr Siminton, in the present proceeding, acted on a bona fide misunderstanding of the order, will fall for consideration, on the evidence, when it becomes necessary to determine what action the Court should take in response to any contravention on the part of Mr Siminton.EXTRA-TERRITORIAL OPERATION  52 Mr Siminton also submitted that Order 1(e) did not have extra-territorial operation so as to apply to accounts, otherwise comprehended by its terms, which were held off shore.This objection, as I understood it, applied to Charge 1.9 which alleges that Mr Siminton gave instructions that a sum of money held in an account controlled by him in a bank in Austria should be transferred to the Holzheimer\\'s Visa account.53 Order 1(e) applied to accounts which Mr Siminton had authority to operate.The order was not confined, in terms, to accounts held within Australia.54 This objection must fail.At all relevant times Mr Siminton has been in Australia and subject to the jurisdiction of the Court.That jurisdiction includes power, under s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), to make orders of the kind which Gray J made in this proceeding: see Siminton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2006] FCAFC 118 ; (2006) 152 FCR 129 at 132; Australian Competition and Consumer Commissioner v Purple Harmony Plates Pty Ltd (No 3) (2002) 196 ALR 576 at 589.There was no jurisdictional obstacle to Mr Siminton being required not to perform certain acts in Australia which might lead to consequential action being taken overseas.In National Australia Bank Ltd v Dessau [1988] VR 521 at 522 Brooking J summarised the applicable legal principles as follows:  \"That a court of equity, acting as it does in personam, may order someone amenable to its jurisdiction to do or refrain from doing an act abroad was established quite early in our history, before even the days of the Boston Tea Party (Penn v Lord Baltimore (1750) 1 Ves Sen 444; 27 ER 1132).The jurisdiction is grounded not on any pretension to the exercise of judicial power abroad but on the circumstances that the defendant, being amenable to the Court\\'s jurisdiction can be personally directed to act or not to act ...\"  THE CHARGES  55 It will be convenient to deal collectively with Charges 1.1 to 1.5 and separately with Charges 1.7, 1.9 and 1.11.I propose to record my findings in respect of all charges and then to make some particular observations in relation to some of them.56 In seeking to make good each of these charges APRA invites the Court to draw certain inferences.This invitation is made in circumstances in which neither Mr Siminton nor any other persons, such as the Holzheimers, who might reasonably have been expected to have knowledge of relevant events, gave evidence.No adverse inference can be drawn merely because Mr Siminton has chosen not to give or call evidence in defence of the charges.The failure is nonetheless of potential significance.This is because, as the High Court explained in RPS v R [2000] HCA 3 ; (2000) 199 CLR 620 at 632-633:  \"...it will seldom, if ever, be reasonable to conclude that an accused in a criminal trial would be expected to give evidence.The most that can be said in criminal matters is that there are some cases in which evidence (or an explanation) contradicting and apparently damning inference to be drawn from proven facts could come only from the accused.In the absence of such evidence or explanation, the jury may more readily draw the conclusion which the prosecution seeks.As was said in Weissensteiner v The Queen:    \\'[I]n a criminal trial, hypotheses consistent with innocence may cease to be rational or reasonable in the absence of evidence to support them when that evidence, if it exists at all, must be within the knowledge of the accused.\\' \"(footnotes omitted).The inferences which APRA invited the Court to draw are founded on uncontradicted evidence.Counsel for Mr Siminton did not make any specific submissions as to why the inferences for which APRA contended should not be drawn.57 In each case I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that those inferences ought to be drawn, that the conclusions contended for by APRA are supported by the evidence and that the evidence does not support a finding that there is any reasonable or rational hypothesis consistent with Mr Siminton\\'s innocence of any of these charges.58 I am also satisfied that the affidavit and documentary evidence tendered by APRA strongly supports the case made by it and that this evidence establishes each of the matters of fact necessary to make good each of the charges.59 Charges 1.1 to 1.5.Each of these charges involved the transfer of funds from the Mobile EFT Account, held in the name of the Principality of Camside, to the Holzheimer\\'s Visa account at the Bank of Adelaide.The evidence supports the conclusion that Mr Siminton was the only person with authority to direct that funds paid into the Principality of Camside account should be transferred to the Holzheimer\\'s Visa account and that he had, in fact, given a standing instruction that this was to occur.It may be assumed, in Mr Siminton\\'s favour, that he did not give Mobile EFT specific instructions to make the transfers which are the subject of these charges.The transfers occurred because of the pre-existing arrangements under which, after the expiry about eight days, moneys owing to the Principality of Camside were transferred after the deduction of Mobile EFT\\'s commission.Nonetheless, each time, after 10 January 2006, on which Mr Siminton accepted a credit card payment in favour of the Principality of Camside he was aware that, in accordance with his standing instruction to Mobile EFT, that sum (less commission) would be transferred to the Holzheimer\\'s Visa account.Despite this, he continued to accept the credit card payments and did not revoke the standing order pursuant to which the transfers were made.He thereby constructively dealt with and withdrew funds from the Mobile EFT account acting through the agency of Mobile EFT.Order 1(e) restrained him from acting by agents to deal with or withdraw funds from any account which he had authority to operate.Mobile EFT was such an agent.I am satisfied that APRA has proven beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Siminton deliberately engaged in the conduct alleged in Charges 1.1 to 1.5 inclusive and that that conduct contravened Order 1(e) made by Gray J on 10 January 2006.60 Charge 1.7.Charge 1.7 deals with the disposition of moneys transferred into the Holzheimer\\'s Visa account.Between 2 May and 16 August 2006 over $14,000 was withdrawn from the Holzheimer\\'s Visa account.The Holzheimer\\'s held those funds as nominees of Mr Siminton.Of this sum $2,887.27 was withdrawn in a series of 31 transactions using a credit card which I infer was supplied by Mrs Holzheimer to Mr Siminton.In each case the vouchers provided to merchants were signed by Mr Siminton even though the name Holzheimer appeared on the card.During the same period the account was used to make payments totalling $12,500 to Mr Siminton\\'s solicitors and $7,000 to counsel acting for him.The vouchers supporting these transactions were not in evidence.It may, however, reasonably be inferred that Mr Siminton authorised each of these transactions.61 I find that APRA has established Charge 1.7 beyond reasonable doubt.I do not, therefore, make findings in relation to Charges 1.6 and 1.8.62 Charge 1.9.This charge relates to the transfer, from the Anglo-Irish Bank in Austria, to the Holzheimer\\'s Visa account of almost $25,000.The Austrian account was controlled by Mr Siminton.It was held in his name.At his direction the money was transferred on 16 August 2006, shortly after the balance of the Visa account fell into debit.Mr Siminton drew on the account by using the card on the same day.The evidence adduced by APRA satisfied me beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Siminton is guilty of this charge.63 Charge 1.11.This charge deals with the disposition of a large part of the money transferred from the Anglo-Irish Bank to the Holzheimer\\'s Visa account.In each case the funds were withdrawn by the use of the credit card which Mrs Holzheimer had supplied to Mr Siminton.Two amounts of $1,000 each were withdrawn in cash from an automatic teller machine.Mr Siminton was filmed undertaking these withdrawals.The film footage was shown in Court.No submission was made that the person pictured undertaking the withdrawals was a person other than Mr Siminton.Vouchers were obtained for four further transactions totalling $507.42.These transactions were undertaken using vouchers which were signed by Mr Siminton.One of these four transactions was also captured on video footage.I, therefore, have little difficulty in drawing the inference that the other transactions which were made using the card during the relevant period were made by Mr Siminton.64 I find Charge 1.11 established beyond reasonable doubt.I do not, therefore, make findings in relation to Charges 1.10 and 1.12.CONCLUSION  65 Charges 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.7, 1.9 and 1.11 have been established beyond reasonable doubt.I will give directions as to the steps which need to be taken in advance of a hearing on penalty.I certify that the preceding sixty-five (65) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Tracey .Associate:Dated: 7 November

      " \"Though 3D object detection from point clouds has achieved rapid progress in\\nrecent years, the lack of flexible and high-performance proposal refinement\\nremains a great hurdle for existing state-of-the-art two-stage detectors.\\nPrevious works on refining 3D proposals have relied on human-designed\\ncomponents such as keypoints sampling, set abstraction and multi-scale feature\\nfusion to produce powerful 3D object representations. Such methods, however,\\nhave limited ability to capture rich contextual dependencies among points. In\\nthis paper, we leverage the high-quality region proposal network and a\\nChannel-wise Transformer architecture to constitute our two-stage 3D object\\ndetection framework (CT3D) with minimal hand-crafted design. The proposed CT3D\\nsimultaneously performs proposal-aware embedding and channel-wise context\\naggregation for the point features within each proposal. Specifically, CT3D\\nuses proposal's keypoints for spatial contextual modelling and learns attention\\npropagation in the encoding module, mapping the proposal to point embeddings.\\nNext, a new channel-wise decoding module enriches the query-key interaction via\\nchannel-wise re-weighting to effectively merge multi-level contexts, which\\ncontributes to more accurate object predictions. Extensive experiments\\ndemonstrate that our CT3D method has superior performance and excellent\\nscalability. Remarkably, CT3D achieves the AP of 81.77% in the moderate car\\ncategory on the KITTI test 3D detection benchmark, outperforms state-of-the-art\\n3D detectors.\"\n",
      " 'A mated pair of bald eagles that have nested in the U. S. National Arboretum since 2014 are now starting a family, taking turns incubating two eggs  —   and one of them could hatch sometime Tuesday. Two webcams are currently trained on their nest in Washington, D. C. You can watch the webcam online  —   we’ll note that the American Eagle Foundation warns, ”This is a wild eagle nest and anything can happen.” What we’re all hoping for is that first ”pip,” the sign of a baby bird trying to break through its shell, followed by a successful emergence. The two eggs were laid on Feb. 10 and Feb. 14 on Twitter,   have been using the #dceaglecam hashtag to follow the nest, and to guess when that first egg will hatch. ”This is the first Bald Eagle pair to nest in this location since 1947,” the foundation says. It adds that the two eagles have been dubbed Mr. President and The First Lady. If both eaglets emerge and remain healthy, they would continue a streak of success for their parents, who raised one eaglet last year at the National Arboretum, a   green space and research facility that’s about two miles northeast of the Capitol building.'\n",

It\\'s an honor that, uh that has seen 57 names enshrined on the wall of honor and tonight, we make it 58. So please stand as I present my very good friend a man who keeps our pencils sharp... (scattered chuckling) and our pens in ink... Frank William Abagnale.

He struggled so hard that eventually he churned that cream into butter and crawled out. Gentlemen, as of this moment, I am that second mouse.

PAULA: The girls don\\'t know what they\\'re in for. Show him the dance you were doing when we met. Ah, who can remember? The people in that little French village were so happy to see Americans they decided to put on a show for us. So they crammed 200 soldiers... Yeah, we know the story, Daddy. ...into that tiny social hall and the first person to walk onstage is your mother, and she starts to dance. You know, it had been months since we\\'d even seen a woman and here\\'s this blonde angel. Blonde bombshell. (giggles) And the men are literally holding their breath. Holding their breath for you. You hear that? (giggles) Mm-hmm. And I turned to my buddies and I said... \"I will not leave France without her.\" And I didn\\'t. You didn\\'t. I didn\\'t. (liquid spills) Oh, shit! Oh, shit, the rug! Aw, Mom... I can\\'t believe I did that. No, no, it\\'s nothing. It\\'s nothing. Oh, Frankie, Frankie, get a towel. - Yeah, yeah. - Paula... Come on. ~ My sweet embraceable you... ~ Dance with me, Paula. Ah... (giggles) (instrumental interlude playing) Whenever I dance for you I get in trouble. (mouthing): Watch this. (chuckles) Oh! (laughs) Frank! Wake up. Come on, let\\'s go! Get up. Come on, come on. Frank, wake up. (groans): Dad... You don\\'t have to go to school today. It\\'s okay. Why? Is it snowing? Do you have a black suit? I overslept again, huh? We have a very important meeting in the city. Eat that. Come on, come on, eat. Ma\\'am, open up. Just open up, please! - Ma\\'am? - It\\'s important. What? Oh, gosh! We don\\'t open for half an hour! Open the door, please. Just open the door. It\\'s important. l-I\\'m sorry, we don\\'t open for half an hour. What\\'s your name, ma\\'am? Darcy. Darcy. That\\'s a pretty name. I\\'m in a bit of a fix. I need a suit for my kid. This is my son Frank. Oh, hi. He needs a black suit. Black suit... There was a death in the family. My father, 85 years old, war hero. Yeah? There\\'s a funeral this afternoon, military funeral planes flying overhead, 21-gun salute. Geez. Frank needs to borrow a suit for a couple of hours. I\\'m sorry, we don\\'t loan suits, and we\\'re not open. Darcy... Darcy, please. -(sighs) - Come back. Darcy... is this yours? (jingles) I just found it in the parking lot. Uh-huh. It must\\'ve slipped right off your neck. (tires screeching) Don\\'t hit the curb. (brakes squeaking) Now get out, walk around the back and hold the door open for me. (car horn honks) All right. What\\'s next? Okay, stop grinning. When I get inside, you go back to the front seat and wait. Even if a cop comes and writes you a ticket you don\\'t move the car, understood? Dad, wha-what\\'s all this for? You know why the Yankees always win, Frank? \\'Cause they have Mickey Mantle? No, it\\'s \\'cause the other teams can\\'t stop staring at those damn pinstripes. Watch this. The manager of Chase Manhattan Bank is about to open the door for your father. Mr. Abagnale, um we don\\'t usually loan money to people who have unresolved business with the IRS. That\\'s a misunderstanding. I hired the wrong guy to do my books. A mistake, I... anybody could make it. I just need you guys to help me weather the storm. Sir, you\\'re being investigated by the government for tax fraud. My store is a landmark in New Rochelle. I have customers all over New York. Well, you\\'re not a customer at Chase Manhattan. We don\\'t know you. I\\'m sure your bank in New Rochelle they know you, they could help you out. My bank went out of business. Banks like this one put them out of business. Now, I know I made a mistake, I admit that but these people want blood. They want my store. They\\'ve threatened to put me in jail. (stammers) This is America, right? I\\'m not a criminal. I\\'m a Medal of Honor winner a lifetime member of the New Rochelle Rotary Club. All I\\'m asking is for you to help me beat these guys. It\\'s not a question of winning and losing. It\\'s a question of risk. You\\'re the largest bank in the world. Where\\'s the fu... Whe... Where\\'s the risk? Dad, how could you just let him take our car like that? He didn\\'t take anything. We took him. He overpaid by $500. Come on, Frank. Let\\'s return the suit. (Paula sobbing) This place is good. It\\'s small but, you know it\\'s going to be a lot less work. A lot less work for you. (jackhammer drilling in distance) (keys clank) FRANK: Hey, Dad. Hi. Where\\'s your mother? I don\\'t know. She said something about going to look for a job. What\\'s she gonna be a shoe salesman at a centipede farm? (laughing) (both laughing) What are you doing? (both laughing) You want some pancakes? For dinner? On my son\\'s 16th birthday? We\\'re not gonna eat pancakes. Come on, why are you looking at me like that? You thought I forgot? - I didn\\'t think you forgot. - I opened a checking account in your name. I put $25 in the account so you can buy whatever you want. Don\\'t tell your mother. I won\\'t. Thanks, Dad. Yep. Didn\\'t that bank turn you down for a loan, though? Yes, they all turned me down. (chuckles) Then why you opening a banking account with them? Well, because one day, you\\'ll want something from these people... a house, a car. They have all the money. There\\'s 50 checks there, Frank which means, from this day on... you\\'re in their little club. I\\'m in their little club. You got that, you got it all. It\\'s even got my name there, huh? To the moon. - To the moon! - To the moon. (bells tolling) See that? It\\'s just a school. No different than Westbourne. Ma... you said you were going to quit. Frankie, you don\\'t have to wear the uniform here. Why don\\'t you take off your jacket? I\\'m used to it. (indistinct conversation) Excuse me. Oh, yes? Do you know where room 17 French is? GIRL: Yeah, it\\'s... (snickering) (school bell ringing) BO Y: But you frickin\\' killed him. (loud indistinct conversation) You selling encyclopedias? Yeah, he looks like a substitute teacher. (boy laughing) (loud conversation and laughter continues) Quiet down, people! My name is Mr. Abagnale! That\\'s Abagnale, not Abagnahlee not Abagnaylee, but Abagnale! Now, somebody please tell me where you left off in your textbooks. Excuse me, people, if I need to ask again I\\'m going to write up the entire class. Take your seats! Chapter seven. Will you please open your textbooks to, uh, chapter eight and we\\'ll get started? Excuse me, what\\'s your name? Brad. Brad, why don\\'t you get up here in front of the class here and read conversation number five? (pronouncing poorly): \"Les Francais sonts \"uh, generalement -\"dans leur pais que... -(students laughing) presque tout le monde a cette impression...\" They sent for me. They said they needed a sub for Roberta. I came all the way from-from Dixon. Well, uh, I always sub for Roberta. Excuse me, why aren\\'t you reading? (continues reading) I\\'ll never come back to-to Bellarmine Jefferson again! - You tell them not to call me! -(students laughing) What do they think, it\\'s easy for a woman my age and all the money that it costs to travel? I tell you, they don\\'t give a damn. (students laughing) Mr. And Mrs. Abagnale this is not a question of your son\\'s attendance. I regret to inform you that, for the past week Frank has been teaching Mrs. Glasser\\'s French class. He what? Your son has been pretending to be a substitute teacher lecturing the students, uh, giving out homework. Mrs. Glasser has been ill and there was some confusion with the real sub. Your son held a teacher-parent conference yesterday and was planning a class field trip to a French bread factory in Trenton. Do you see the problem we have? - Mrs. Davenport? - Yeah. Uh, I have a note to miss fifth and sixth period today. Doctor\\'s appointment. - One moment. -(phone ringing) I\\'ll be right with you. (whispering): Hey... MRS. DAVENPORT: Yes? You should fold it. What? That note. It\\'s a fake, right? You should fold it. It\\'s... It\\'s a note from my mom. I have a doctor\\'s appointment. Yeah, but there\\'s no crease in the paper. When your mom hands you a note to miss school the first thing you do is, you fold it and you put it in your pocket. I mean, if it\\'s real, where\\'s the crease? -(school bell ringing) -(door opens) (quietly): Frankie. (both chuckling quietly) Ma, I\\'m home. (romantic music plays on record player) Oh, you remember that girl Joanna I was telling you about? I asked her out today. Think we\\'re going to go to the Junior Prom. (record scratches, music stops) Ma, is this my driver\\'s license? That\\'s all there is, two bedrooms. Oh, Frankie. You remember Dad\\'s friend? Jack Barnes? From the club. Hello. He came by looking for your father. I was giving him a tour of the apartment. It\\'s very, uh, uh, spacious, Paula. Dad\\'s at the store. So, Frank... you\\'re getting to look more like your old man every day. Thanks for the sandwich, Paula. I\\'ll see you later, eh? Wait. Is this yours? Oh. Well, thanks, Frank. Uh, that\\'s the President\\'s pin. I\\'d be in deep trouble if I lost that. (nervous chuckle) I\\'ll see you all later, eh? Are you hungry, Frankie? I\\'ll make you a sandwich. Jack wanted to talk business with your father. He thinks we should get a lawyer and sue the government. That is not legal, what they\\'re doing to us. Why aren\\'t you saying anything? You\\'re not going to tell him... are you? (quietly): No. That\\'s right. There\\'s nothing to tell. I\\'m going out for a few hours to visit some old friends from the tennis club and... when I get home, we\\'ll all have dinner together. Right? But you won\\'t say anything because it\\'s... it\\'s just silly, isn\\'t it? How could we sue anybody? Oh... do you need some money, Frankie? A few dollars to buy some record albums? Here, take five dollars. Or-Or ten. You promised you were going to quit. (slams) (children laughing) (dog barking in distance) Ma, I\\'m home! (door opens) Hey, hey! You... You stay away from me, hear me? You stay away from me... I don\\'t know who you are but if you ever come back here again... Frankie! Frank, Frank, calm down, will you? I\\'m Dick Kesner. Now, I want you to leave your things here and follow me into the next room, okay? They\\'re all waiting for you. PAULA: You don\\'t have to be scared. I\\'m right here, Frank. I\\'ll always be here. But there are laws. Everything in this country has to be legal. So what we need to do is make some decisions. That\\'s what Mr. Kesner is here for. Many times these decisions are left up to the courts but that can be very expensive, Frank people fighting over their children. Nobody is fighting. Look at me, Frank. Nobody is fighting. (speaking French) (quietly): Dad, what\\'s going on? Dad, what\\'s going on? (speaking French continues) Do you remember your grandma, Eve? She arrived this morning. (speaks French) Hello. Do you understand what we\\'re saying to you, Frank? Your father and I are getting a divorce. (speaking French) Nothing\\'s gonna change. We\\'re still gonna see each other. Stop it, please, Frank. Don\\'t interrupt. Frank, you don\\'t have to read all of this. Most of it\\'s for your parents... boring adult business... but this paragraph right here, this is important because it states who you\\'re gonna live with... after the divorce... whose custody you will be in. And there\\'s a blank space right here. (Eve speaking French) And I want you to go into the kitchen sit at the table and put a name down. You can take as long as you want but when you come back into this room... I want to see a name on that line. Frank, just write down a name and this will all be over. It\\'s gonna be okay. FRANK: Dad, what name? Your mother or your father. Just put the name there. It\\'s as simple as that. And don\\'t look so scared. It\\'s not a test. There\\'s no wrong answer. (man announcing trains indistinctly) (melancholy jazz playing) Hi. (panting) One ticket to Grand Central, please. That\\'ll be $3.50, sir. Is it okay if I write you a check? Carl, when do I get to call my father? You can call him when we get to New York. We leave for the airport in seven hours. Paris, France 1969 Until then, just sit there. Be quiet. You know, Carl, on the other side of the hotel they got suites that face the park. It\\'s the best room the FBI can afford. It\\'s okay, I\\'ve stayed in worse. Mr. Mudrick... Mr. Mudrick, please. You have to listen. I don\\'t want to hear your story. This is two checks that bounced. You know how much trouble I\\'m in? No, but listen, I\\'m telling you, the bank, they made the mistake. I\\'ll write you another check right now! What, do I look like I was born yesterday? Look, it\\'s midnight, Mr. Mudrick. Where am I gonna go? You\\'re a goddamn kid. Go home. (baby crying in distance) ~ ~ ~ ~ I mean, I hope you understand. My boss sent me to Brooklyn, then Queens. Now he wants me in Long Island to take a few clients out for a night on the town. I\\'m sorry, but we\\'re not allowed to cash checks from other banks. How would we know if they were any good? What did you say your name was? Ashley. Ashley... you know what I found on the sidewalk out there? Must\\'ve slipped right off your neck. Is there something I can help you with, son? Well, you see, it\\'s my grandmother\\'s birthday next week and I want to get her something extra-special. Please, I mean it\\'s my midterm next week and my books were stolen. (raspy coughing) Please, it\\'s just five dollars. No one would have to know. I\\'m sorry, but we are not allowed to take checks from people we don\\'t know. (horns honking, whistle blowing) ~ ~ (women laughing) Pleasure to have you back, Captain Carlson. What do you think, Angelo? The tomatoes are ripe this afternoon. (women giggling) Well, what have we here? - Can I have your autograph? - You betcha. - Can I have your autograph, too? - You gonna be a pilot? - Mm-hmm! - All right, then. There you go. Work hard in school. FRANK: Dear Dad: I have decided to become an airline pilot. I have applied to all the big airlines and I have several promising interviews lined up. How\\'s Mom? Have you called her lately? Love, your son, Frank. Hello. I\\'m Frank Black from Murrow High School and I have an appointment with Mr. Morgan. You\\'re the young man who\\'s writing the article for the school paper. Yes, ma\\'am, that\\'s me. I want to know everything there is to know about being a pilot. What airports does Pan Am fly to? What does a pilot make in a year? And who tells them where they\\'re gonna fly to? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. Just take \\'em one at a time. All right. What does it mean when one pilot says to another pilot: \"What kind of equipment are you on?\" They just want to know what kind of aircraft you\\'re flying: Is it a DC-8, 707, Constellation? And what about those I.D. badges that I\\'ve seen pilots wear? Well, every pilot has to have two things with him at all times: One is his airline personnel badge... Iooks just like this one here, from Pan Am... the other one is their FAA license... and that looks just like this. Oh. Sir, do you think I can make a copy of this to put into my article? Oh, Frank, you can have that one. It\\'s three years expired. Aw, thanks! And what about your I.D. badge? You have an extra one I could borrow? Oh, no, I can\\'t help you there. Those are special-ordered from Polaroid. The only way to get one of those is to become a real live pilot for Pan American Airways. (dialing phone) (car horns honking, whistle blowing) WOMAN (over phone): Pan Am, may I help you? FRANK (Southern accent): Yeah, hello. I\\'m calling about a uniform. WOMAN: Hold for Purchasing. FRANK: Thank you. WOMAN 2: Purchasing. FRANK (Southern accent): Hi. I\\'m a copilot based out of San Francisco. I flew a flight into New York last night but the problem is I\\'m headed out to, uh, Paris in three hours. WOMAN 2: How can we help you? FRANK: I sent my uniform to be cleaned through the hotel and I... I guess they must have lost it. WOMAN 2: They lost a uniform. Happens all the time. Go down to the Well-Built Uniform Company at Ninth and Broadway. They\\'re our uniform supplier. I\\'ll tell Mr. Rosen you\\'re coming. ROSEN: You look too young to be a pilot. I\\'m a copilot. Why so nervous? How would you feel if you, uh Iost your uniform first week on the job? Relax. Pan Am\\'s got lots of uniforms. It\\'s gonna be $164. Great. I\\'Il, uh, I\\'ll write you a check. Sorry, no checks, no cash. You\\'ll have to fill in your employee I.D. number and then I\\'ll bill Pan Am. They\\'ll take it out of your next paycheck. Even better. FRANK: Dear Dad: You always told me that an honest man has nothing to fear. So I\\'m trying my best not to be afraid. I\\'m sorry I ran away, but you don\\'t have to worry. I\\'m gonna get it all back now, Daddy. I promise. I\\'m going to get it all back. (approving murmur) GIRL: Are you a real live pilot? I sure am, little lady. What\\'s your name? Celine. Celine, it\\'s a pleasure to meet you. It\\'s a pleasure to meet you, too. That\\'s fifty, seventy eighty, ninety, one hundred dollars. You have yourself a great time in Paris. I always do. Excuse me. I\\'m John Modiger. I manage this branch. I want to thank you for coming in and using our institution. Well, it\\'s a pleasure to meet you, John. I\\'ll be back again. Good. Have you stayed with us before? Uh, no, I\\'ve been primarily based on the West Coast. Is it all right if I write you a check for the room? No problem, sir. Great. Uh... I was also wondering if I could write you a personal check? For airline personnel, we cash personal checks up to $100. Payroll checks we cash up to $300. Did you say $300 for a payroll check? (typewriter keys clacking) FRANK: Dear Dad: I\\'ve decided to become a pilot for Pan American Airways... the most trusted name in the skies. They\\'ve accepted me into their training program and told me that if I work hard I should earn my wings real soon. Please get in touch with Joanna Carlton from the tenth grade. Tell her I\\'m sorry that I could not take her to the Junior Prom. Love, your son, Frank. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Hello, how are you? Fine, thank you. I have a payroll check here I\\'d like to cash. Certainly. Thank you. Uh, excuse me. I\\'m sure you hear this all the time but you have the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen. Yeah, I do get that all the time. (nervous laugh) How would you like it? ~ ~ Oh, I\\'m sorry, sir. We won\\'t have any cash until the banks open in an hour but, uh, I\\'m sure they can cash your check at the airport. The airport? Who cashes checks at the airport? Well, the airlines, sir. They\\'ve always taken care of their own. (jet passing overhead) (indistinct flight announcement over P.A.) Hello. Hi. Are you deadheading? What? Are you my deadhead to Miami? Mi...? Yes, yes. (laughs) Yeah, I\\'m the deadhead. Here you go. You\\'re a little late, but the jump seat is open. (chuckling): You know it\\'s been awhile since I\\'ve done this. Which one\\'s the jump seat again? (both laughing) Have a nice flight. Are you my deadhead? STEWARDESS: Frank, Captain Oliver. - John Larkin, the copilot. - Hello. Fred Tulley, flight engineer. Frank Taylor, Pan Am. Thanks for giving me a lift, boys. Go ahead and take a seat, Frank. We\\'re about to push. What kind of equipment you on, DC-8? Uh, 707. You turning around on the redeye? Uh, I\\'m jumping puddles for the next few months trying to earn my keep running leapfrogs for the weak and weary. No shame in that. We all did it. Have a seat. Thank you. Would you like a drink after takeoff? M-Milk? OLIVER: 80 knots. LARKIN: Check. V-one. Rotate. (jet engines roaring) V-two. Positive rate. Gear up. FRANK: Dear Dad: Today was graduation. I am now a copilot earning $1,400 a month plus benefits and the best part is they tell me my family can fly for free. So tell Mom to pack her bags and buy a new swimsuit because I\\'m taking us all to Hawaii for Christmas. I love you, Dad. Aloha, Frank. Hello, deadhead. Hello. Enjoying your free ride? Marci... did you drop this? Must\\'ve slipped right off your neck. No... (chuckling) (giggling): No! No... MARCl: Yes, yes, yes, yes! (Frank moans passionately) Yes! (clanking and clattering) (Marci panting) Why are you stopping? I want to tell you something, Marci. This is by far... the best date I have ever been on. (laughing) ~ ~ WOMAN: I\\'d like to open a Money Market, please. Okay. Welcome to Miami Mutual Bank. How may I help you? My name is Frank Taylor. I\\'m a copilot for Pan Am. I\\'d like to cash this check here, and then I\\'d like to take you out for a steak dinner. (laughing) (teller giggling) And then we feed the checks into the MICR machine which uses special ink to encode the account numbers on the bottom of the checks. And where are these numbers? They\\'re, um... right here. Right there? See? (both giggling) They\\'re called routing numbers. So where do the checks get routed to? You know, I don\\'t exactly know. Nobody ever asked me that before. (both laughing) AUCTIONEER: Our next item up for bid is also from the Jersey Central Bank foreclosure. This is a MICR encoder a machine used to encode bank checks. Do I have an opening bid? HANRATTY: Our unknown subject is a paperhanger who started working on the East Coast. In the last few weeks, this unsub has developed a new form of check fraud which I\\'m calling \"the float. \" What he\\'s doing is he\\'s opening checking accounts at various banks then changing the MICR ink routing numbers at the bottom of those checks. Next slide, please. (projector clanks) Next slide, please. Uh, the remote thing is broken. You\\'ll have to do it by hand. You\\'ve gotta... try the... FBI Headquarters Washington, D.C. Agent Mullen, it should be... it should be the square button just there by the side. This carousel doesn\\'t work. It\\'s a bad carousel you got there. Thank you, Agent Mullen. Got to move it manually. This is a map of the 12 banks of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Slide. (clicking) MICR scanners at every bank read these numbers at the bottom of a check... slide... and then, ship that check off to its corresponding branch. Carl, for those of us who are unfamiliar with bank fraud you mind telling us what the hell you\\'re talking about? The East Coast branches are numbered zero-one to zero-six. The central branch is zero-seven, zero-eight so on, so forth. You mean those numbers on the bottom of a check actually mean something? All of this was in the report I filed two days ago. If you change... a zero-two to a one-two that means that check, which was cashed in New York does not go to the New York Federal Branch but it is rerouted all the way to the San Francisco Federal Branch. The bank doesn\\'t even know the check has bounced for two weeks which means our unsub can stay in one place paper the same city over and over again while his checks circle the country. You know, you want to talk to my wife. She\\'s the one balances the checkbook at our house. (agents laughing) Next slide. (three-piece combo plays soft jazz) Daddy! (chuckling) My son, the birdman. Some uniform, Frank. What do you think? Nice. Sit down. (clears throat) So, Dad... Daddy, have you gotten the postcards? Of course. This fork is ice cold. No, no, Dad, th-that\\'s a chilled salad fork. (whispering): It\\'s a fancy restaurant, you know. (sighing) Well, here... l-I got you something. What\\'s that? Open it. You know what those are, right? Those are the keys to a 1965 Cadillac DeVille convertible. Brand-new, Dad. Red with white interior split seats, air conditioning, the works. Are you giving me a Cadillac? Yeah. I\\'m giving you a Cadillac. Dad, sh-she\\'s parked downstairs. When we\\'re done eating lunch why don\\'t you, you know, drive on over to Mom\\'s house pick her up, take a little joyride? Do you know what would happen if the IRS found out I was driving around in a new coupe? I took the train here, Frank. I\\'m taking the train home. All right. I have plenty of money. You know, if you ever, ever need anything... You worried? About me? No, I\\'m not... I\\'m not worried. You think I can\\'t buy my own car? Two mice fell in a bucket of cream, Frank. Which one am I? You\\'re that second mouse. I went by the store today. I had to close the store for awhile. It\\'s all about timing, Frank. The goddamn government knows that. They hit you when you\\'re down. I wasn\\'t going to let them take it from me, so I just... shut the doors myself, called their bluff. Sooner or later, they\\'ll forget about me. I understand, I... Have you told Ma? She\\'s so stubborn, your mother. Don\\'t worry. I\\'m not going to let her go without a fight. I been fighting for us... (gasps quietly) Dad? ...since the day we... we met. Daddy, out of all those men you were the one that took her home, remember that. 200 men, sitting in that tiny social hall watching her dance. What was the name of that town? Montrichard, Dad. Yeah. I didn\\'t speak a word of French and six weeks later, she was my wi... She\\'s your wife. My son bought me a Cadillac today. I think that calls for a toast. (soft jazz playing) (inhaling deeply) To the best damn pilot in the sky. It\\'s not what you think. I\\'m just a copilot. You see these people staring at you? These are the most powerful people in New York City and they keep peeking over their shoulders wondering where you\\'re going tonight. Where you going, Frank? Dad, nobody\\'s staring at me. Some place exotic? Just tell me where you\\'re going. Los An... Hollywood. Hollywood. (sniffles) (whispering): The rest of us... really are suckers. So, I got on this red dress and these high heels, right? And I got a bra, like, out here, okay? And I\\'m chasing these two Puerto Rican guys through the park. Hollywood California They got a suitcase filled with bank robbery loot. Okay, I\\'m screaming out, \"FBl, freeze!\" And I\\'m reaching for my gun, but I can\\'t find it in the bra. It\\'s so damn big I thought I was going to shoot my tits off. (laughing) You know, that\\'s a funny story. People always laugh at that story. Let me ask you a question, Mr. Amdursky. If you were having so much fun undercover why did you transfer to bank fraud? I didn\\'t transfer. I was censured and reassigned. It\\'s like being punished. I was punished. I screwed up in the field. What about you, Mr. Fox? Were you... punished for screwing up in the field? Oh, no, no, no, I\\'ve never worked in the field before. I audited background investigations of Department of Justice clerical applicants. Well, that\\'s just great. I ask for a team and they drag the bottom of the Pacific. You mind if I ask you a question, Agent Hanratty? How come you\\'re so serious all the time? Does it bother you, Mr. Amdursky? Yeah. Yeah, it does bother me. Does it bother you, Mr. Fox? A little, I guess. Well, would you like to hear me tell a joke? Yeah. Yeah, we\\'d love to hear a joke from you. Knock, knock. Who\\'s there? Go fuck yourselves. (swing music playing on car radio) ~ Tall and tan and young and lovely ~ ~ The girl from Ipanema... ~ MAN: He cashed three checks. They all cleared. I was going to deposit this one today. I don\\'t want any trouble. No trouble. No trouble at all. We\\'ll just take this check and be on our way. Thank you. Good. Because I don\\'t want my customers harassed. ~... Each one she passes goes ahh... ~ What are you saying, he\\'s still here? 201. ~... Oh, but he watches so sadly... ~ Thank you. Corner here. Oh, thanks, son. ~... How can he tell her he loves her... ~ Some steps. Steps. Hey, Mr. Murphy, how are you? Is that Frank? Yeah, it\\'s Frank. Hey, Frank, how are you? How\\'s the knee? Come on, I\\'ll race you right now. (chuckling): Take care. Okay, Frank. AMDURSKY: \"Eyeball the back\"? Come on, Carl, this guy\\'s a pen and ink man. A goddamn paperhanger. He doesn\\'t even carry a gun. Why can\\'t we go with you, Carl? You just keep your eyes open, do your job and I\\'ll buy you both a Good Humor bar. (grunts) (gasps) It\\'s all right, ma\\'am. FBI. (whimpers) 201... 201, 201. 201... 201... 201... 201... 201... (anxious breathing) (music building dramatically) FBI! (crunching) (toilet flushing) FBI! Come out of the bathroom! Step out of the bathroom! Hands on your head. Oh, that\\'s the new IBM Selectric. Put your hands on your head. You can change the print type in five seconds. - Shut up! - Just pop out the ball. Put your hands on your head! Put your hands...! You know, he\\'s got over 200 checks here, a gallon - Of India ink, drafting. - Hands on your head! Even has little payroll envelopes addressed to himself from Pan Am. Put it down! Drop it! Relax. You\\'re late, all right? My name\\'s Allen, Barry Allen United States Secret Service. Your boy just tried to jump out the window. My partner has him in custody downstairs. I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about. You think the FBI are the only ones on this guy? I mean, come on. Come on, he\\'s dabbling in government checks here. We\\'ve been following a paper trail on this guy for months now. Hey, you mind taking that gun out of my face? Please. Really. I mean, it makes me nervous. Let me see some credentials. Yeah, sure. Take my whole wallet. (clears throat) You want my gun, too? Come over here. Take my gun. Hey, hey, look, just do me a favor. Take a look outside. Look. Look out the window. My partner\\'s walking him to the car as we speak... Look. Old guy almost pissed in his pants when I came through the door. He jumped right through the window onto the hood of my car. Hey, Murph? - Yeah? - Call the LAPD again. I don\\'t want people walking through my crime scene. (raspy cough) I didn\\'t expect the Secret Service on this. Don\\'t worry about it. (clears throat) Well, what\\'s your name? Hanratty, Carl Hanratty. (sighs) Mind if I see some identification? Sure. You never can be too careful these days. Well, tough luck, Carl. Five minutes earlier you would\\'ve landed yourself a pretty good collar. It\\'s all right. Ten seconds later, and you\\'d have been shot. Mind if I come downstairs with you? l-I got to take a look at this guy. Sure thing. Just, uh, do me a favor and sit tight for a second while I get this evidence downstairs. You know, I don\\'t want some maid walking through here and making the bed. LAPD should be here any sec. Wait. Your wallet. You hang onto it for a minute. I trust you. (sighs) (exhaling) (groans) Oh... (chuckling) Yeah... Secret Service. (ominous music begins) ~ ~ ~ ~ (music building) Hey! Oh, goddamn it! It was stupid. I made a stupid mistake. Forget about it. There are hundreds of unknown subjects out there. l-I can get this guy, Sean. The worst thing a paperhanger can do is show his face. I read the report. Six feet tall, brown hair, 27 to 30 years of age 160 pounds. This could be almost anybody. I heard his voice, Sean, I saw his face. There\\'s nothing for him to hide behind anymore. Just be careful. You got 12 years in. Nobody bothers you down on the first floor. You practically wrote the book on bank fraud. That\\'s the kind of thing that can make you section chief someday. Just don\\'t put yourself in this type of position. What type of position? Position of being humiliated. Sean, would you like to hear me tell a joke? Yeah, sure. (pointedly): Knock, knock! FRANK: So, my-my next question is, when a pilot retires uh, Pan Am sends them a check every single month? Uh, yeah, pension program sends a check and benefits. How much is that check for? Uh, kid, I\\'m really not in the mood for this right now. This Skywayman\\'s driving me crazy. Who\\'s the Skywayman? Ah, some nut that\\'s flying around the country posing as a Pan Am pilot. There\\'s a column about him in the paper today. I keep telling them this is not my problem. This guy doesn\\'t even fly Pan Am. Flies everybody else. Flies United, TWA, Continental, Eastern... (whispering): The Skywayman. Newspaper loves this clown. They call him \"the James Bond of the sky.\" (chuckles) Did you say...? Bond, James Bond. (\"007\" theme playing) BOND: Tell me, Joan, why does he do it? WOMAN: He likes to win. MAN: Come on, come on. WOMAN: We\\'ll be landing in 20 minutes. Do you want to play it easy or the hard way? And this isn\\'t a tranquilizer. Well, Pussy, you do know a lot more about planes than guns. (imitating Sean Connery): Hello, Pussy. (normal voice): Now, you\\'re sure this is the suit, right? Positive. It\\'s the exact suit he wore in the movie. (Connery voice): Okay. I\\'ll take three. Certainly, Mr. Fleming. Now what you need is one of those little foreign sports cars that he drives. (\"007\" theme playing) (engine revving) (final \"007\" chord strikes) ~ The look of love ~ ~ Is in your eyes... ~ Hello. Hi. ~... The look your heart... ~ Haven\\'t I seen you before? ~... Can\\'t disguise... ~ Maybe. A couple years ago, I was on the cover of Seventeen. Yeah. You\\'re that model, right? Cheryl. Yes. The guys used to put your picture on their lockers. Isn\\'t that your silver car I saw parked out front? Yeah. One of them. ~ Well, it takes my breath away... ~ So, think I could get an autograph? ~...  I can hardly wait to hold you ~ ~ Feel my arms around you... ~ Do you have a pen in your room? ~... How long I have waited... ~ (rhythmic mechanical thumping) ~ You\\'ve got the look of love ~ ~ It\\'s on your face ~ ~ A look that time can\\'t erase... ~ Shh. ~... Be mine tonight... ~ Man like you can buy anything he wants. ~... Let this be just the start ~ ~ Of so many nights like this... ~ He buys a deck of cards at the hotel gift shop. ~... And then seal it with a kiss... ~ Well, you want to see a card trick? ~...  I can hardly wait to hold you... ~ How much did these cards cost? ~... Feel my arms around you... ~ Oh, 55 cents, I think. ~... Waited just to love you... ~ And if they sold me downstairs at the hotel gift shop... how much would you pay? I\\'m sor... I\\'m sorry, how mu... how much would I pay for what? (romantic instrumental music playing) The entire night. How much would you pay me for the entire night? Cheryl, I... I really don\\'t know. ~...  I can hardly wait to hold you... ~ Don\\'t be scared. ~... How long I have waited... ~ Make me an offer. ~... Now that I have found you ~ ~ Don\\'t ever go... ~ $300? Go fish. (sheepish chuckle) Uh, $500? Go fish. (chuckles) $600. (both chuckling) Go fish. (saxophone playing sexy riff) $1,000. Okay. $1,000. Okay. I\\'ll be right back. Wait a second. Where are you going? I\\'m going downstairs to cash a check. You think this hotel is going to cash a $1,000 check at 3:00am? It\\'s a New York Savings and Loan check. It\\'s like gold. They\\'ll cash it. Don\\'t you think they might get a little suspicious? Let me see that. It\\'s a cashier\\'s check. Endorse it over to me. No. I couldn\\'t do that. See, this check is for $1,400. We agreed upon $1,000. Why don\\'t I give you back $400 and you give me that check? Even better. ~ The look of love ~ ~ Is in your eyes... ~ (saxophone continues melody) Does this belong to anybody? ~ Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say... ~ (phone ringing) ~ On a bright Hawaiian Christmas Day... ~ This is Hanratty. Merry Christmas. FRANK: Hello, Carl. Hello. ~... That we send to you, from the land... ~ Barry Allen, Secret Service. I\\'ve been trying to track you down now for the last couple of hours. What do you want? I wanted to apologize for what happened out in Los Angeles. Uh-uh, uh-uh. No, no, you don\\'t apologize to me. Do you always work on Christmas Eve, Carl? I volunteered so men with families could go home early. Looked like you were wearing a wedding ring out in Los Angeles. I thought maybe you had a family. No. No family. You want to talk to me... let\\'s talk face-to-face. All right. I\\'m at my suite at the Stuyvesant Arms, room 3113. In the morning, I leave for Las Vegas for the weekend. You think you\\'re going to get me again? You\\'re not going to Vegas. You\\'re not in the Stuyvesant Arms. You\\'d love for me to send out 20 agents Christmas Eve we barge into your hotel, knock down the door so you can make fools out of us all. I\\'m really sorry if I made a fool out of you. I really am. Uh-uh, no. No, listen, I really am. No, no, you-you do not feel sorry for me. The truth is, I knew it was you. Now maybe I didn\\'t get the cuffs on you, but I knew. Ah, people only know what you tell them, Carl. Well, then tell me this, Barry Allen, Secret Service. How did you know I wouldn\\'t look in your wallet? The same reason the Yankees always win. Nobody can keep their eyes off the pinstripes. The Yankees win because they have Mickey Mantle. No one ever bets on the uniform. (Frank chuckles) You sure about that, Carl? I\\'ll tell you what I am sure of. You\\'re going to get caught. One way or another, it\\'s a mathematical fact. It\\'s-It\\'s like Vegas. The House always wins. Well, Carl, I\\'m sorry, but I have to go. Ah. You didn\\'t call just to apologize, did you? (laughing) What do you mean? You... you... you have no one else to call. (laughing) Oh, ho, ho. (phone bell dings) (guffaws) (humming) ~...  Morn and night... ~ (melancholy melody playing) (melody fades) You got that burger up? Yep. (\"He\\'s So Fine\" playing on radio) - Hi. - Hi! How are you? ~... Doo-lang, doo-lang, doo-lang... ~ ~ The one with the wavy hair... ~ More coffee, sir? Are you a collector? Of what? \"Captives of the Cosmic Ray,\" \"The Big Freeze\" \"Land of the Golden Giants.\" I\\'ve got them all. What are you talking about? Barry Allen. The Flash. Wait, kid, kid, kid. You mean like the comic book? Yeah, the comic book. When he\\'s not The Flash. That\\'s his name, Barry Allen. Thank you. Now get this: He reads comic books. Comic books! Barry Allen is The Flash! FOX: Carl, slow down. Slow down. I don\\'t know what the hell you\\'re talking about. He\\'s a kid. Our unsub is a kid. That\\'s why we couldn\\'t match his prints. That\\'s why he doesn\\'t have a record. Now, I want you to contact NYPD for every all-points juvenile runaways in New York City. And don\\'t forget the airports. He\\'s been kiting checks all over the country. But why New York? The Yankees! He said something about the Yankees! HANRATTY: So where are we on the list? (rings doorbell) FOX: Number 53, \"Abagnahlee.\" HANRATTY: Good morning, ma\\'am. We\\'re the FBI agents who called. Yes, I\\'ve been waiting. I hope you\\'re all hungry. I put out the Sara Lee. My husband Jack is a lawyer. What about your first husband, Mrs. \"Abagnahlee\"? Abagnale, but I prefer to be called Barnes. \"Frank William Abagnale.\" It says here he was in the service. Did... Did you two meet during the war? Yeah, I lived in a very small village in France... Montrichard... the kind of place where they never heard of Sara Lee. Help yourselves. \"Nobody doesn\\'t like Sara Lee.\" You filled out a missing person\\'s report for a runaway juvenile by the name of Frank Abagnale Jr. Is Frankie okay? You\\'re aware of the fact that he wrote some checks on a closed account at Chase Manhattan Bank? Oh, yes. The police think he\\'s some type of criminal. What he did was a felony, Mrs. Barnes. It was $1,000. Half the kids his age are on dope throwing rocks at police and they scared me to death because my son made a little mistake. Huh. A 17-year-old... boy has to eat has to have a place to sleep. We understand, ma\\'am. Would you happen to have a picture of your son? Oh, yes. I have his old yearbook. Okay. Okay, okay, we, uh... we need to send out an all-office teletype. Our unsub\\'s name is Frank Abagnale Jr., age 17. Is Frankie okay? Is he in trouble? Ma\\'am, I\\'m sorry to have to tell you: Your son is forging checks. Forging checks? Wait! I\\'m sure we can take care of that. I am working part-time at the church now. Just tell me how much he owes and I\\'ll pay you back. So far, it\\'s about $1.3 million. (timer dings) ~ Girl, you really got me goin\\' ~ ~ You got me so I don\\'t know what I\\'m doin\\' ~ Riverbend Apartments Atlanta, Georgia ~ Yeah, you really got me goin\\' ~ ~ You got me so I can\\'t sleep at night... ~ Hi, Melanie, how are you?

Come quick! Lance just fell into the conversation pit! Excuse me, you know where Lance Applebaum is? Thank you. DOCTOR: These bottles need to be labeled when you pick them up.

WOMAN (over P.A.): Dr. Blair, Dr. Blair Dr. Sherwood Blair. (gently): Hey, hey... you okay? (sniffling): He told me to pick up the blood, so I did, but he never told me to label it. Hey, it\\'s okay. Stop crying. What\\'s your name? - Brenda. - Brenda. Brenda, I wouldn\\'t worry about it. You know, these doctors you know, they don\\'t know everything. It\\'s my first week and I think they\\'re going to fire me. No, no, nobody\\'s going to fire you, Brenda. I bet you\\'re good at your job. No, I\\'m not. Yeah, I bet if I asked you to check on the status of my friend Lance Applebaum that you could do that for me in a second. WOMAN (over P.A.): Nurse Fitzsimmons to Recovery. Nurse Fitzsimmons to Recovery. Um... Mr. Applebaum fractured his ankle. Dr. Ashland is treating him in exam room seven. You see that? No problem. This is the emergency chart.

I got mine off last year. Boy, I hated them. They were bottoms. You know, I still got to wear my mouth guard. You have really nice teeth. Well, thank you. And you have a pretty smile. WOMAN (over P.A.): Custodial to cafeteria. (giggles) No, I mean it. I really think those braces look good on you. Thank you. You\\'re welcome. Brenda. Yeah.

I\\'ve taken a night job at a hospital and met some really nice people. Feels good to have my feet on the ground to wake up in the same bed every night. Who knows, maybe I\\'ll even find someone to settle down with. Harvard Medical School... top of your class. Southern California Children\\'s Hospital. Well, that\\'s a pretty impressive resume, Dr. Conners but unfortunately, uh... the only thing I need is a... an emergency room supervisor for my midnight to 8:00am shift someone to baby-sit six interns and 20 nurses but, uh... Hell, I doubt that, uh, you would be interested in that. Well, in the past they\\'ve always let me choose my own nurses. Dr. Connelly? Dr. Harris? Present. Dr. Ashland? Dr. Conners... You gonna take roll every night? Uh, yes, I will, Dr. Ashland and if you\\'re going to be late, I suggest you bring a note. (snickering) Miss Basmann. Miss Mace. Miss Strong. Here.

Yeah? So, did it hurt when they took them off? Mine felt so weird after. Mm, I keep rubbing my tongue over them. I can\\'t stop. They\\'re so slippery. It feels good, though, doesn\\'t it? Yeah, it feels incredible. (thunder rumbles) Oh, my. I\\'m... I\\'m sorry. (thunder crashes) (passionate moaning) WOMAN (over P.A.): Dr. Conners to the ER. Dr. Conners to the ER. Shouldn\\'t you go? No. No, no. They have a staff doctor in the emergency ward. We\\'ll be fine. (panting): What if he\\'s in surgery? Do you really think I have to go? Oh. In here, Dr. Conners. (child sobbing) (sobbing) Gentlemen, what, uh... what seems to be the problem? Bicycle accident. Fractured tibia about five inches below the patella. Hmm. - Dr. Harris. - Yes? Do you concur? C... Concur with what, sir? With what Dr. Ashland just said. Do you... Do you concur? Uh... well, it was a bicycle accident. Um, the boy told us. So you concur? Concur? Uh... I think we should take an X ray then stitch him up and put him in a walking cast. (moans) That\\'s very good, Dr. Ashland. Very good. Well, you don\\'t seem to have much need for me. Carry on.

Well, if you\\'re going to arrest me I\\'d like to put on a different suit if that\\'s okay with you. No, no, I\\'m not here to arrest you. I\\'m looking for your son. He\\'s in trouble. Do you know where he is? If I tell you where he is will you promise not to tell his mother? Sure. Frank made up a fake I.D. and enlisted in the Marine Corps. He\\'s over in Vietnam right now. That kid is halfway around the world crawling through the damn jungle fighting the Communists, so... (shuts refrigerator door) please, don\\'t come to my home and call my boy a criminal because that kid has more guts... I never said he was a criminal, Mr. Abagnale. I said he was in trouble. If you\\'d like to give me a call and talk, here\\'s my number. (pen scribbling) You\\'re not a father, are you? Pardon me? If you were a father, you\\'d know. I would never give up my son. I would never give up my son. Yes, sir. I understand. Sean, Sean, now get this: \"Riverbend Apartments 415 Landover, Atlanta, Georgia.\" Atlanta, Georgia. Yeah, I\\'m on my way to the airport. I\\'ll meet the team in, uh, in four hours. Bye-bye. Come on, it\\'s okay. (Brenda sobs) You don\\'t have to cry. I\\'m sorry. I\\'m so sorry, Frank. I can\\'t do this. Brenda, listen to me. I don\\'t care if you\\'re a virgin, all right? Really, I can wait. I\\'m not a virgin. I had an abortion two years ago. My parents had a friend do it a man that my father plays golf with. And then, when I got better, they kicked me out of the house. I had an abortion and I wasn\\'t their daughter anymore. (gently): Hey... I\\'m so sorry. Please don\\'t be mad at me. Please, please, don\\'t be mad at me. No, no. Please don\\'t be mad at me. Shh. Now... what if... what if I spoke to your parents, right? May-Maybe I can straighten things out, huh? Well, I ask them all the time but they said I still can\\'t come home. And my daddy\\'s... a lawyer. Aw... Brenda... what if you were engaged to a doctor? Will that change anything? What? What if I went to your parents... and I spoke to your father... and I asked permission to marry you? ~ ~ It\\'s empty. Nobody here. ~ ~ (classical music playing) New Orleans (woman laughs) Dr. Conners, are you Lutheran? Yes, l-I am a Lutheran, but, please, call me Frank. Frank, would you like to say grace? Unless you\\'re not comfortable. Absolutely. (clears throat) Two little mice fell into a bucket of cream. The first mouse quickly gave up and drowned but the second mouse, he struggled so hard that he eventually churned that cream into butter and he walked out. - Amen. - Amen. Amen. Oh, that was beautiful. The mouse, he churned that cream into butter. (sighing happily) That\\'s right. That\\'s pretty good. Thank you. Frank, have you decided which hospital you want to work at here in New Orleans? Well, um, to be quite honest I\\'m thinking about getting back into law. Oh, my! Are you a doctor or a lawyer? Before I went to medical school, I passed the bar in California. I practiced law for one year then I decided why not try my hand at pediatrics? You\\'re just full of surprises. Yeah. MOTHER (laughing): Oh, my. A doctor and a lawyer. Well, I\\'d say that Brenda hit the jackpot. Where did you go to law school? Uh, Berkeley. (gasping) Berkley, Berkley. Oh, my gosh. Isn\\'t that where you went, Daddy? Maybe Frank could come work for you, Roger. You\\'re always saying how hard it is to find Assistant Prosecutors. Could he, Daddy? Could he, please? Could he come work with you, please? Was that snake Hollingsworth still teaching there when you went through Berkley? (laughs quietly) Hollingsworth. Yes. Grumpy old Hollingsworth, right? I tell you. Meaner than ever. And that dog of his? Tell me, Frank, what was the name of his little dog? I\\'m sorry. Uh... The dog was dead. (women cooing) How unfortunate. Yeah. A doctor, a lawyer, a Lutheran... So what are you, Frank? \\'Cause I think you\\'re about to ask for my daughter\\'s hand in marriage and I have a right to know. Know what, sir? The truth. Tell me the truth, Frank. What are you doing here? What is a man like you doing with Brenda? If you want my blessing if you want my daughter I\\'d like to hear it from you now. The truth is, sir, that... The truth is that... I\\'m not a doctor, I\\'m not a lawyer... I\\'m not an airline pilot. I\\'m... I\\'m nothing, really. I\\'m-I\\'m-I\\'m just a kid who\\'s in love with your daughter. No. You know what you are? You\\'re a romantic. Men like us are nothing without the women we love. I must confess, I\\'m guilty of the same foolish whimsy. I proposed to Carol after five dates with two nickels in my pockets and holes in my shoes because I knew she was the one. So go ahead, Frank. Don\\'t be afraid. Ask the question you came here to ask me. Sir, uh, uh... w-what would I have to do to take the bar here in New Orleans? (laughing) No, the... the other question. (ticking) WOMAN: Right through that door. Good luck, Mr. Conners. Thank you. December 26, 1969 Hey, Frank... you know what I could never figure out? How did you cheat on the bar exam in Louisiana? Why? What\\'s the difference? Someone else took the test for you, didn\\'t they? Carl, I\\'m going to prison for a long time. Seriously, what\\'s the difference? It\\'s a simple question. Are you going to eat that eclair? Yeah. I\\'m saving it for later. Well, you want to split it with me? No. Give me half that eclair and I\\'ll tell you. I\\'m going to figure it out sooner or later. You\\'ll be working under Phillip Rigby in corporate law. Why don\\'t you settle in, organize your desk? Thank you. We\\'re having lunch at 12:30 with the Attorney General and Governor McKeithen. Himself. The Governor. Did we spell it right? You sure did. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. Welcome aboard. Now... Look at this photograph, Mr. Stewart. It\\'s a photograph of Prentice York where they found him, dead. Now, here is an enlargement of part of that photograph. This is a photograph of the defendant\\'s signature on a canceled check. Now, here is an enlargement of that same signature which matches the signature on the letters that he wrote to Mrs. Simon which discuss the possibility of defrauding the great State of Louisiana. Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury this is irrefutable evidence that the defendant is, in fact, lying. (echoing thud) (chair slams against floor) Mr. Conners, this is a preliminary hearing. There is no... defendant. There is no... jury. It\\'s just me. Son... what in the hell is wrong with you?! -(applause over TV) - Is that Mitch? Roger! It\\'s Mitch! Oh, my, I lost all track of time. MITCH MILLER (on TV): As studio guests for the sing-along tonight we have the children\\'s choir of St. Monica\\'s Church in New York City.

You see what I\\'m doing? Do you have a good lawyer? Well... I sort of am a lawyer now. Look at this letter. The IRS wants more. I had a deal with them: two penalties. They ate the cake, now they want the crumbs. I want to sue them. Now they want the crumbs. They... Here, sit down. They\\'re trying to scare me, intimidate me. You know what? You know what? I\\'ll make them chase me... for the rest of their lives. Hey, it\\'s great to see you, Daddy. Listen, sit down, I... I want to show you something. I came here to give you this. It\\'s an invitation to an engagement party. Daddy, I\\'m getting married. Can you believe that? I\\'m getting married. You don\\'t need to worry about anything now, Dad. Listen, I\\'m getting a brand-new Cadillac. I\\'m getting a $60,000 house. I\\'m-I\\'m getting it all back. All-All the jewelry, all the furs, everything, Dad. Everything they took from us, I\\'m going to get it back. Now... has Ma seen you dressed like this? Yeah, she came to pick up some boxes. That\\'s okay, that\\'s okay, you know why? \\'Cause she... she\\'s going to the wedding with us. I\\'m going to get you a brand-new suit, Dad. I\\'m getting you a brand-new suit. One of those Manhattan Eagle, three-button, black pearl suits. You\\'ll look great. Those are nice. Yeah. She won\\'t see me. Well, have you tried to call her? Uh-uh. Why don\\'t... why don\\'t you call her right now? Dad, why don\\'t you call her right now? Here. Dad, just call her. Call her for me. You call her, and you tell her I have two first-class tickets to go see her son\\'s wedding... Your mother\\'s married now, to my friend Jack Barnes. They have a house in Long Island. (whispering): I had an FBI agent come see me. You got their number, son. The guy looked scared. The United States government, champ, running for the hills. Pow! To the moon! Dad... it\\'s over. I\\'m going to stop now. But y-you\\'ve... They\\'re never going to catch you, Frank. - Dad, she wouldn\\'t do that. - Why won\\'t you sit down? - Why would she do that to you? - Come on, sit. Come on, sit with me. Have a drink. I\\'m your father. Then ask me to stop. (quietly): Then ask me to stop. You can\\'t stop. Where are you going? Come on, Frank, where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going tonight? Someplace exotic? Where are you going tonight? Tahiti, Hawaii? (phone ringing) This is Hanratty. FRANK: Hello, Carl. Merry Christmas. How are you, Dr. Conners? Carl, I haven\\'t been Dr. Conners for months now. (Hanratty sniffles, clears throat) Well... I\\'m sitting here in my office on Christmas Eve. What do you want? (instrumental version \"I\\'ll Be Home for Christmas\" playing) (sighs): Okay. I want it to be over. Uh... I want it to be over. I\\'m getting married. You know, I\\'m settling down. You\\'ve stolen almost $4 million. You think we can just call that a wedding present? Nah, this isn\\'t something you get to walk away from, Frank. I want to call a truce. No truce. You will be caught, you will go to prison. Where did you think this was going? Please leave me alone, Carl. Please? I\\'m getting close, aren\\'t I? You\\'re scared because I\\'m getting close. I know you... you rented that car in Shreveport and you stayed in that hotel on Lake Charles. You want to run, be my guest. Your checks don\\'t lie as well as you do. Stop chasing me. I can\\'t stop. It\\'s my job. It\\'s okay, Carl. I just thought I\\'d ask, you know? Hey. Merry Christmas, huh? (click and dial tone) I love my job. All right... (clears throat) let\\'s get every newspaper we can every newspaper in Louisiana for the last two months. What are we looking for? Engagement announcements, name of Conners. Conners?! Come on, Carl, the kid would\\'ve changed his name by now. Mm-mm. He can\\'t change it. She thinks he\\'s Conners. If he loses the name, he loses the girl. ~ I can\\'t give you anything ~ ~ But love, baby ~ ~ That\\'s the only thing I have plenty of ~ ~ Baby ~ ~ Dreamin\\' a while, schemin\\' a while... ~ - Congratulations. - You having a good time? ~...

Carl Hanratty, FBI. This is Agents Amdursky and Fox. Sorry to crash your party, sir. Not at all. What can I do for you? If it\\'s not too much trouble, I\\'d like to meet the groom. Is there a problem? -(laughter) - Frank! Frank! Can you hold all these? (whispering): Yeah. Come here. They\\'re checks. They\\'re from my dad\\'s friends. They\\'re for us, so we can start a new life... Hey! What are you doing? What\\'s wrong? We have to leave. What?! Brenda, you love me, right? Yes. I mean, you\\'d love me no matter what. Yes. I mean, you\\'d love me whether I was sick or whether I was poor or even if I had a different name. Frank, where\\'d you get all that money? Brenda, listen. A name, right? A name, it doesn\\'t matter. My name is Frank Conners, right? - That\\'s who I am with you. - Yes. But-but we all have secrets. You know, sometimes when I travel I use the name Frank Taylor. That-That\\'s my secret. - Frank Taylor?! - Yeah, Frank Taylor, you know? - Frank Black. - Frank Black?! Yeah, it doesn\\'t matter. Why are you saying all this? Brenda... Brenda, I don\\'t want to lie to you anymore. All right? I\\'m not a doctor. I never went to medical school. I\\'m not a lawyer or a Harvard graduate or a Lutheran. Brenda, I ran away from home a year and a half ago when I was 16. Frank... Frank? You\\'re not a Lutheran? Brenda... you see all this money? You see all this money? I have more. I have plenty more. I have enough money to last us for the rest of our lives -(gasps) - Look. Frank, stop teasing me. You\\'re Frank Conners. You\\'re Frank Conners, and you\\'re 28 years old and... (whispering): Brenda... Why would you lie to me? - Brenda, Brenda... - I want to know your name. - Listen to me, Brenda. - Tell me your name. We can live anywhere we want but you have to trust me, Brenda. - Do you trust me? - Yes. - Do you love me, Brenda? - Yes. - You love me? - I love you. Excuse me, Mother. Honey, this is Mr. Hanratty. My wife Carol. - Oh, Mister...? - Hanratty, ma\\'am. - Ratty. - Yes. Have you seen Frank or Brenda? l-I think they went upstairs. Frank... (whispers): Brenda, come here. Okay, in two days, you\\'re going to meet me at Miami International Airport, all right? You\\'re going to leave the house after your parents go to sleep. You\\'re going to take a taxicab. You give the taxi driver this money right here and you tell him to drive all through the night. Brenda, you\\'re going to leave at 10:00am. - 10:00am, all right? - But... (scatting) ~ I never stop ~ ~ Till I get to the top... ~ (jazz continues in distance) Which room, sir? In the corner. You have to listen to me, all right? The International Terminal in Miami, all right? Say it. Okay, the International Terminal in Miami. - No matter what... - No matter what... - You\\'re going to take a taxicab. - I will take a taxi. You\\'re going to be there at 10:00am. I will be there at 10:00am, no matter what. - In two days. - Two days. Two days, Brenda. Two days. In two days, I\\'ll be there no matter what, at 10:00am. You\\'re not going to tell anyone, Brenda. You have to promise me, now. (crying): Frank, please! Before you go, please tell me your name. Please, tell me.

He must\\'ve got wise to us. HANRATTY: Maybe he was tipped. If he\\'s not here today, he\\'ll be tomorrow. We\\'ll get him before he leaves the country. He doesn\\'t have a passport. For the last six months, he\\'s gone to Harvard and Berkeley. I\\'m betting he can get a passport. So we have all our men waiting for him here in Miami International. He\\'s used it before. He knows the layout. I talked to Miami police; they\\'ve offered us 50 uniformed cops in two shifts of 25. With our guys, that\\'s almost 100 men in one airport. Don\\'t you think we should spread it around? No, no, this is the exit point. Well, how do you know he hasn\\'t rented a car and driven to airports in New York, Atlanta? Because I\\'m not in New York. I\\'m not in Atlanta. Yes, this is, uh, Frank Roberts and I\\'m letting all the universities in the area know that Pan Am will be initiating a new recruiting program this year. I\\'Il, uh, be stopping by your campus tomorrow morning. Thank you all very much for coming. At the end of the day I\\'ll be choosing eight young ladies to be a part of... (cheering and laughter) ...Pan Am\\'s future stewardess flight crew program. Now, these eight young ladies will accompany me on a two-month public relations tour through Europe. (women squealing) They will discover firsthand what it takes to be a Pan American stewardess. (cheering) HANRATTY: Give me at least two men... Nah, one man per every two counters. - Mm-hmm. - All right? Amdursky? Yeah? Make sure your uniforms are covering the sidewalk entrances and exits. Hey... let\\'s have, uh, periodic sweeps of the men\\'s lav. You, here. What qualifies me to be a future stewardess? Well, I think that I\\'m really friendly and I can really help out and, um, make people feel welcome on the plane and... We\\'ll be traveling at 6,000 miles per hour at an altitude of 300 feet. ~ All my bags are packed, I\\'m ready to go... ~ (playing dramatic piano intro) Ilene Anderson.

There\\'s a guy in a Pan Am uniform sitting in a white Coupe DeVille out in front of Terminal J. That\\'s the charter terminal. Can you get a look at his face? He\\'s got his pilot\\'s cap on.

Hey! ~ Pack up, let\\'s fly away. ~ (engine roaring) Seven months later HANRATTY: South America, Australia Singapore, Egypt. The kid\\'s gone completely out of control. Why wasn\\'t I called? FOX: Nobody was called, sir. The banks didn\\'t know what was happening till last week. That\\'s impossible. They didn\\'t call \\'cause it\\'s not counterfeiting. - It\\'s something else. - Well, what is he doing? He\\'s making real checks, sir. These are so perfect the airline didn\\'t know the difference. Last check was cashed in Madrid a week ago. My guess is he\\'s still there. We have to leave now, sir. Today. Go where? Spain? You want to go to Spain? Well, eventually, he\\'s got to go back to where the checks were printed. I think that\\'s why he\\'s moving back through Europe. Look at the map, sir. He\\'s making a circle. He\\'s running out of checks. I know it\\'s a... it\\'s a long shot, sir but if we track him from Madrid, sir, we could still catch him. I\\'m sorry, Carl, if you couldn\\'t catch him here you\\'re not going to catch him there. But, sir, we\\'re going to let him get away. No, Carl, you let him get away.

Two tons, without the ink. (inhales, clears throat) Where do they do printing like this? Germany, Great Britain... France. BOTH PRINTERS: France! France. Frank\\'s mother said the name of a village in France where they didn\\'t have Sara Lee. The village where she met Frank\\'s father. Oh, yeah, I don\\'t remember, uh... It started with an M. It was, uh, \"Mont\" something. \"Mont.\" Mr. Fox? Uh, yes, yes. Question: \"You met your husband during the war?\" Answer: \"Yes, I lived in a small village in France. Yeah, right. \"The kind of place where they never heard of Sara Lee.\" Tell me you wrote down the name of the village, Mr. Fox. Montrichard.

Do you want some beans, Carl? They got the best French beans here. Here, give these a try. There\\'s two dozen French police officers outside. Carl, I gotta tell you, they\\'re delicious. They wanted to bring you in. You want a bite? But they needed the help of an American. Are you hungry? You want a bite? But I told them I wouldn\\'t bring them to you unless I could put the cuffs on you myself. Well, you have a gun? You have a gun? - No gun? - No. No gun. And-and you\\'re... and you\\'re telling me what? There\\'s, uh, there\\'s uh... (chuckles) there\\'s two dozen French police officers out there right now on Christmas Eve? That\\'s what you\\'re telling me? Yeah. (chuckling): All right, all right. Well, there\\'s no windows here. I\\'m going to take a look out the front door. No! No! I told them I\\'d walk out first and give a signal. Here, you can put these on yourself. No, I can\\'t do that! I can\\'t do that. You know why? (panting) \\'Cause I think you\\'re full of shit. I don\\'t... I don\\'t think there\\'s anyone else out there. I think... I think it\\'s just me and you. That\\'s right. I think it\\'s just me and you, and you know what? You\\'re going to have to catch me yourself! I wo... we don\\'t have time for this. Ah, that\\'s good. That\\'s good. Tell me what you want me to see, huh? I wouldn\\'t lie to you. Look, you\\'re wearing a wedding ring. You\\'re wearing a wedding ring, Carl! You lied to me about that! Didn\\'t you lie about that?! You asked me if I had a family. I did, but I don\\'t anymore. (phone ringing) (anxious breathing) (ringing continues) Yes? No, no, no, there is no problem. We\\'re coming out right now. (laughing) Whoa, that was good. That was good. What, did you... you pay some hotel desk clerk to make that call for you, is that what you did? It was Captain Luc. I\\'ve got one minute to bring you out. Captain Luc? Captain Luc! Ooh, Captain Luc. Well, Carl, I gotta say that-that sounds pretty official to me but like I said, I... I think it\\'s just me and you here, it\\'s me and you. So you\\'re going to have to catch me. Frank. Frank! You have to trust me on this! These people have been embarrassed, Frank. They\\'re angry. You rob their banks, you steal their money you live in their country. I told you this was what was going to happen that there was no other way for it to end. Don\\'t make a mistake! That\\'s good. That\\'s good, Carl, you know? Keep pushing that lie. Keep pushing it. Keep pushing till you make it true. They\\'re going to kill you! You walk out that door, they\\'re going to kill you. (panting) Is that the truth? Yeah. You have any children, Carl?

He fell down some steps at Grand Central Station trying to catch a train. I didn\\'t want to be the one to tell you. You\\'re lying, right? You said I could talk to him. Carl, who are you to... who are you to say something like that, huh? Who are you to say something like that? You said I could talk to him. He fell, and he... and he broke his neck. I\\'m sorry. I\\'m really sorry. (panting) (hits seat) (sobbing): Goddamn it! Carl, I\\'m going to be sick! -(people muttering) - It\\'s all right. It\\'s all right. It\\'s okay.

Maybe a nail polish remover where the acetone removes the ink that\\'s not been printed? How did you do it, Frank? How did you cheat on the bar exam in Louisiana? I didn\\'t cheat. I studied for two weeks and I passed. Is that the truth, Frank? Is that the truth? I\\'ll bet this guy steals checks out of mailboxes. He washes off their names and he puts on his own. You\\'re saying that he\\'s a local? Well, if it were me, you know I\\'d call the bank first, I\\'d check out the balance... Make sure there\\'s enough money in there to make it worth your while.

      " 'A Bayesian network is a graphical model that encodes probabilistic\\nrelationships among variables of interest. When used in conjunction with\\nstatistical techniques, the graphical model has several advantages for data\\nanalysis. One, because the model encodes dependencies among all variables, it\\nreadily handles situations where some data entries are missing. Two, a Bayesian\\nnetwork can be used to learn causal relationships, and hence can be used to\\ngain understanding about a problem domain and to predict the consequences of\\nintervention. Three, because the model has both a causal and probabilistic\\nsemantics, it is an ideal representation for combining prior knowledge (which\\noften comes in causal form) and data. Four, Bayesian statistical methods in\\nconjunction with Bayesian networks offer an efficient and principled approach\\nfor avoiding the overfitting of data. In this paper, we discuss methods for\\nconstructing Bayesian networks from prior knowledge and summarize Bayesian\\nstatistical methods for using data to improve these models. With regard to the\\nlatter task, we describe methods for learning both the parameters and structure\\nof a Bayesian network, including techniques for learning with incomplete data.\\nIn addition, we relate Bayesian-network methods for learning to techniques for\\nsupervised and unsupervised learning.

      " 'Boensch v Pascoe [2007] FCA 532 (16 April 2007)http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2007/532.htmlprivilegelegal professional privilegeproduction of documents by solicitor in response to s 77a bankruptcy noticeinadvertent tender of documents by counselwhether waiver of privilegepractice and procedure  Introduction  1 The real issue in this appeal can be stated shortly.It is whether the tender by counsel of six documents, forming part of a 73 page exhibit, constituted a waiver of privilege in the six documents.2 Ironically, the issue arose at first instance in the course of an application to claim privilege over a separate part of the 73 page exhibit.The learned Federal Magistrate found that legal professional privilege had been waived in the six documents.His Honour said, at [11] of his judgment of 22 November 2006, that counsel for the party who tendered the documents \"specifically eschewed\" any suggestion of inadvertence in the tender.He proceeded on the basis that the tender was deliberate.3 The appellant, Mr Boensch, contends that his Honour was in error in concluding that the tender was deliberate and that any claim of inadvertence had been eschewed.Mr Boensch submits that, upon the proper application of the principle stated by the High Court in Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 at 13, there was no implied or accidental waiver of privilege in the six documents.4 The essential reason why this issue arises is the failure of the solicitor who produced the documents to the first respondent, Mr Pascoe, and to the Court, to make proper enquiry as to the extent of the materials comprised within the documents that were produced and tendered.5 In the hope of maintaining clarity in my analysis of the question, I will endeavour to distinguish between the documents produced or referred to at various stages of the proceeding.6 The critical documents, for the purpose of this judgment, fall into three categories.The first category is the six documents that were tendered as part of Exhibit JL1.I will call them the Extra Documents.The second category is certain documents produced to Mr Pascoe and described in my reasons as the First Documents.The third category is certain documents described as Exhibit SDP6 in the application heard before his Honour on 22 November 2006.The Background Facts  7 Mr Boensch is a bankrupt.Mr Pascoe is his trustee in bankruptcy.The second respondent, Mrs Boensch, is Mr Boensch\\'s wife.8 On or about 30 August 2005 Mr Pascoe gave a notice under s 77A of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) to the former solicitor for Mr and Mrs Boensch, Mr James Leong.That section of the Act provides for compulsory production of the documents and records of a bankrupt whose examinable affairs are under investigation.9 On or about 30 September 2005 Mr Leong answered the s 77A notice by providing a number of documents to Mr Pascoe.I will call the documents that were produced to Mr Pascoe in answer to the notice \"the First Documents\".10 Mr Leong\\'s evidence before the Federal Magistrate was that he did not obtain any instructions from Mr Boensch before answering the s 77A notice.Accordingly, Mr Leong had no instructions to claim privilege, nor does he appear to have made such a claim when he produced the First Documents to Mr Pascoe.Moreover, he did not have instructions to waive privilege.11 Nearly ten months later, on 19 July 2006, Mr Pascoe commenced proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court against Mr and Mrs Boensch seeking orders under ss 120 and 121 of the Bankruptcy Act setting aside certain transactions entered into between Mr and Mrs Boensch prior to the date of the sequestration order.12 The application filed in the Federal Magistrates Court was supported by an affidavit sworn by Mr Pascoe.Exhibited to the affidavit was a bundle of documents produced to Mr Pascoe by Mr Leong in answer to the s 77A notice.The documents were described as Exhibit SDP6.I will refer to those documents as Exhibit SDP6 in these reasons.13 Counsel for Mr Boensch submits that the documents in Exhibit SDP6 are a subset of the First Documents.I have not inspected Exhibit SDP6 but the description of them in Mr Pascoe\\'s affidavit filed on 19 July 2006 in the Federal Magistrates Court, as a bundle of file notes of meetings or conversations, indicates that the submission is correct.14 The matter came before Federal Magistrate Raphael for directions on 15 August 2006.The legal representatives for Mr and Mrs Boensch stated that a claim for privilege was to be made over the documents contained in Exhibit SDP6.His Honour directed that any application in relation to the admissibility of Exhibit SDP6 be filed by 5 September 2006.15 On 8 September 2006, Mr and Mrs Boensch filed a document entitled \"Amended Interim Application\" seeking inter alia a declaration that the documents comprising Exhibit SDP6 were documents to which legal professional privilege attaches.His Honour then made an order for the determination of that issue, and an associated question, as a separate question under Part 17 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 .His Honour also referred to the hearing of a preliminary question under s 189 of the Evidence Act 1995 , although it is difficult to see how the occasion for such a hearing had arisen.16 On 20 November 2006 the solicitor for Mr and Mrs Boensch served on Mr Pascoe\\'s solicitor a draft statement of evidence of Mr Leong.An exhibit, referred to as Exhibit JL1 to the statement, was not served at that time but was adopted by Mr Leong when he was called to give evidence before Federal Magistrate Raphael on 21 November 2006.The exhibit appears to have been provided to Mr Pascoe\\'s legal representatives shortly before the hearing.Mr Leong\\'s statement  17 Exhibit JL1 to Mr Leong\\'s statement contained 73 pages of documents.Reference was made in the statement to all of the pages of Exhibit JL1.That exhibit included the Extra Documents.Exhibit JL1 is not identical with Exhibit SDP6 or with the First Documents.I will continue to refer to it as Exhibit JL1.18 Mr Leong\\'s statement concluded by stating in [51] that:  \"All the documents exhibited to this statement are documents I produced to Scott Pascoe in answer to the Notice.\" 19 The only documents exhibited to the statement were those contained in Exhibit JL1.As I have said, they included the Extra Documents.It is apparent that the Extra Documents did not form part of the First Documents, namely those produced to Mr Pascoe in answer to the s 77A notice.20 [50] of Mr Leong\\'s statement was as follows:  \"By this statement I do not intend to disclose any confidential communications for which legal professional privilege may otherwise be properly available.I do not intend to waive any legal professional privilege otherwise properly available.\"  The Proceeding before the Federal Magistrate  21 Mr Leong was called by counsel for Mr Boensch to give evidence on 21 November 2006.Counsel tendered, through the witness, the statement and the exhibit, that is Exhibit JL1.They were marked together by his Honour as Exhibit 1 22 Mr Pascoe\\'s counsel, Mr Johnson, cross-examined Mr Leong.Mr Johnson showed Mr Leong a copy of the documents sent to Mr Pascoe on 30 September 2005, that is to say, the First Documents.Mr Johnson then put to the witness that the content of [51] of his statement was not correct.23 That is to say, Mr Johnson drew Mr Leong\\'s attention to the inaccuracy of the statement in [51] which assumed, incorrectly, that Exhibit JL1 was identical to the First Documents.However, Mr Leong failed to understand this and said that [51] was correct.24 In the course of argument Mr Johnson informed his Honour that the documents in JL1 included documents that had not previously been disclosed to Mr Pascoe.He stated that privilege had been waived \"on all of these documents for this application\".That is to say, Mr Pascoe\\'s claim of waiver of privilege over the Extra Documents was first raised in the course of argument, after the tender of those documents.25 When counsel for Mr Boensch, Mr Heath, realised the apparent error, he informed his Honour.He said:  \"I relied on paragraph 51.If it now appears that in relation to 51 that answer is not correct --- \" 26 The following exchange then took place:  \"HIS HONOUR: Mr Heath, let us get this absolutely clear.You are not being criticised.These things happen.What you are saying is the witness told you something ---  MR HEATH: Yes. HIS HONOUR: --- contained in paragraph 51; right? MR HEATH: Yes, your Honour. HIS HONOUR: Relying upon that --- this is what you say: you gave the documents to Mr Johnson or his solicitors? MR JOHNSON: My recollection is that my friend\\'s instructing solicitor handed them to me, your Honour. HIS HONOUR: Whatever.They got into your hands, Mr Johnson. MR JOHNSON: Yes.Just so there can\\'t be a misunderstanding. HIS HONOUR: And as far as you were concerned they were to be dealt with as any other document in here.And the way in which I am to deal with any document in here is to say either they are privileged or they are not and there is no different category of any of the documents in here; is that right? MR HEATH: That is so, your Honour. HIS HONOUR: Well, what has happened is that either you were misled or mistaken and you have inadvertently, you say, handed Mr Johnson some documents --- additional documents that he had never seen before and for which you would have made a specific claim for privilege and never shown them to him if the facts had been revealed to you; is that right? MR HEATH: Yes.If it is the case that paragraph 51 is incorrect ---  HIS HONOUR: Well, I think it is, isn\\'t it, because he has admitted it.Mr Johnson has asked him two questions; did you give these documents to Mr Pascoe?Answer: no.In relation to both of these documents. MR JOHNSON: I think it: I can\\'t remember now. HIS HONOUR: Or: I can\\'t remember. MR JOHNSON: It has dropped back to: I can\\'t remember. MR HEATH: Yes.But there is an issue about this now obviously.That was my recollection.There were some \"don\\'t recalls\", in there in relation to this.But if it is the case that paragraph 51 is wrong, then the issue of privilege in documents that are included in this but were not, in fact, produced to Mr Pascoe are now disclosed, then such disclosure is inadvertent .\" (Emphasis added.) 27 Later in argument Mr Heath said the following:  \"Your Honour, thank you for the time in relation to this issue.Your Honour, in my respectful submission, no issue of embarrassment or inadvertent disclosure of privilege arises and that is for these reasons.First of all, one has to consider the context of the current proceedings before your Honour.When I say \"current proceedings\" I mean, separate question, preliminary issue, voir dire, however it is to be characterised.That is, the context of the present proceedings before your Honour today are the determination of whether privilege exists in certain documents.\" 28 The \"certain documents\" to which Mr Heath referred, were the documents in Exhibit SDP6.They were the subject matter of the hearing, not the Extra Documents to which the argument moved only after they were tendered.His Honour\\'s reasons for judgment  29 His Honour said at [6] that the essence of Mr Johnson\\'s argument was that the tender of Exhibit 1, that is to say Mr Leong\\'s statement and the exhibit described as Exhibit JL1, was a voluntary act of counsel which had the effect of bringing into the public domain all the documents contained in Exhibit 1 (including the Extra Documents) and waiving any privilege therein.30 His Honour then observed at [7] that, as Mr Heath had correctly pointed out, this was a hearing solely to determine whether the contents of Exhibit SDP6 were the subject of privilege.31 His Honour went on to say at [9] that unfortunately the documents contained in Exhibit 1 were not confined to those in Exhibit SDP6.He said that some of the documents in Exhibit 1 were new documents that had not previously been seen by Mr Pascoe (that is, the Extra Documents).32 The substance of his Honour\\'s reasons may be found in the following paragraphs:  \"[10] What then is the situation with regard to those?Mr Heath says that these documents are no different from SDP6 documents and that Mr Leong\\'s statement in paragraphs 50 and 51 is sufficient to provide privilege to them.But I have difficulty with that.The documents which are contained in the Exhibit are not the documents which are annexed to the statement.I made it clear yesterday that I appreciated that the documents found in the Exhibit may have been placed there as a matter of inadvertence or for some other reason which might mitigate a loss of privilege.But those appearing for the respondents specifically eschewed such an approach.All I am left with then is a deliberate tender of documents which could have been tendered under cover with no more than a description and added to the list of SDP6 documents if that was thought appropriate.But it was not. [11] It seems to me that in those circumstances the dicta of his Honour the Chief Justice in Birks [(1990) 19 NSWLR 677] at 683-684 would apply notwithstanding Mr Heath\\'s eloquent argument of the special nature of these proceedings.It is an argument that I accept but only for those documents for which these proceedings applied, namely the documents in SDP6.\" 33 I granted leave to appeal from his Honour\\'s orders and judgment on 6 February 2007.Whether there was a waiver of privilege over the Extra Documents  34 The test of implied waiver of privilege was stated by the High Court in Mann v Carnell at [29].Their Honours pointed to an intentional act of disclosure which was inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the communication.35 Their Honours went on to say that \"[w]hat brings about the waiver is the inconsistency, which the courts, where necessary informed by considerations of fairness, perceive, between the conduct of the client and maintenance of confidentiality\".They said the test is \"not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large\".36 Reference may also be made to the observations, to the same effect, by Gyles J in Bennett v Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service [2004] FCAFC 237 ; (2004) 140 FCR 101 at [68] .See also the review of the authorities by Allsop J in DSE (Holdings) Pty Limited v Intertan Inc [2003] FCA 384 ; and Lombe v Pollak [2004] FCA 264 at [30] --- [33] dealing with the common law test.37 It is unnecessary for present purposes to determine whether or to what extent the provisions of s 122 of the Evidence Act dealing with the circumstances in which privilege may be lost correspond with the common law principles; see Mann v Carnell at [23]; see also Van Zonneveld v Seaton [2004] NSWSC 960 at [11] (per Campbell J).38 It seems to me that on either approach, what is required is a voluntary act which is inconsistent with the purpose of maintaining confidentiality.An inadvertent or unintentional act will not be sufficient to amount to waiver.39 Of course, \"a mere plea\" of inadvertence may not by itself necessarily enable a party to avoid a waiver of privilege; Hooker Corporation Ltd v Darling Harbour Authority (1987) 9 NSWLR 538 at 542-543.Thus, the Court must be satisfied on the material before it that the act was in truth inadvertent.40 In the present case, inadvertence is established by the fact that even when cross-examined on the documents, Mr Leong did not realise that the documents in Exhibit JL1 included the Extra Documents.41 It was only when Mr Heath realised what had happened that he drew his Honour\\'s attention to the apparent inadvertence.This is clear, in my view from the passages of the transcript that I have reproduced above.42 It is true that in the last passage of the transcript that I have reproduced at [27], Mr Heath said that no issue of inadvertence arose.However, this was because, as Mr Heath correctly observed, the amended application before his Honour dealt only with the question of whether privilege could be maintained over Exhibit SDP6.43 With due respect to his Honour, whose judgment was given ex tempore , an examination of the transcript shows that Mr Heath did not eschew inadvertence in relation to the maintenance of the claim over the Extra Documents.44 Of course, I do not criticise his Honour for delivering ex tempore reasons.It is merely that a full reading of the transcript puts in context the last passage of Counsel\\'s remarks on the issue of inadvertence.45 In any event, I would add that it is difficult to see how the tender of Exhibit JL1 was inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality.It was tendered on an application to claim privilege and it was tendered with the express proviso in [50] of Mr Leong\\'s statement that he did not intend to disclose confidential communications to which privilege may attach.46 The tender of Exhibit JL1 cannot be said to have been to deploy the substance of legal advice for forensic or commercial purposes so as to reveal an implied inconsistency with the maintenance of confidentiality; Bennett at [68].47 I accept Mr Johnson\\'s submission that it is extraordinary that both solicitors and counsel for Mr Boensch failed to make any or any adequate enquiry as to the extent of the materials contained in Exhibit JL1.Some criticism may flow from that.But it does not preclude a finding of inadvertence.48 I do not accept Mr Johnson\\'s submission that the documents in Exhibit JL1 were delivered without qualification as to their status.The qualification was stated in [50] of the statement to which the Exhibit was attached.Although no evidence was put before his Honour to explain the mistake, the circumstances make it plain that error and inadvertence were revealed.Orders  49 I will make orders 1, 3 and 4 sought in the notice of appeal filed on 13 February 2007.I certify that the preceding forty-nine (49) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson.Associate: Dated: 16 April 2007 Counsel for the Appellant: N Perram SC with MJ Heath   Solicitor for the Appellant: Wright Pavuk Lawyers   Counsel for the Respondent: JT Johnson   Solicitor for the Respondent: McLean &amp;

reinstatement in his previous employment as an outdoor education teacher at Lilydale High School, compensation from the date of his dismissal for lost wages and earnings, and costs.2 The applicant began employment at the Lilydale High School on 10 February 2003.He was dismissed from that employment, his dismissal being confirmed by a letter from the Director of the Office of School Education dated 9 April 2003.The reason given for the dismissal at the time was that, for the purposes of gaining employment, the applicant had made a statutory declaration in which he declared that he did not have any convictions, findings of guilt, or pending charges of a non-traffic nature in Victoria, or any other State of Australia, or under Commonwealth law.In fact, as the applicant conceded to the Court, he had been convicted of several offences in the County Court at Melbourne, in November 2002.3 The applicant took proceedings in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (\\'the Commission\\'), pursuant to s 170CE of the Workplace Relations Act .His capacity to do so was challenged on the basis that, because in any event his employment was due to cease in June 2003, he was completing a qualifying period of employment and his application was barred by subss (5A) and (5B) of s 170CE.Initially, on 12 August 2003, Deputy President Hamilton dismissed the applicant\\'s application, on the basis that his employment had been for less than three months, and therefore his dismissal fell within s 170CE(5A).On 22 August 2003, the applicant appealed from the decision of Deputy President Hamilton.A Full Bench of the Commission gave its decision on the appeal on 13 January 2004.The Full Bench allowed the appeal in part.In essence, the Full Bench held that subs (5A) of s 170CE rendered invalid only that part of the application that related to the harsh, unjust or unreasonable ground.The Full Bench decided that, so far as the applicant\\'s application relied on alleged contraventions of ss 170CK and 170CM, it was necessary to refer the application for appropriate further action.4 That further action was conciliation by the Commission.On 6 February 2004 Senior Deputy President Williams of the Commission issued a certificate in accordance with s 170CF(2) of the Workplace Relations Act , certifying that all reasonable attempts to settle the matter by conciliation had been, or were likely to be, unsuccessful in respect of the grounds of alleged contravention of ss 170CK and 170CM.The Senior Deputy President stated that he was unable to make an assessment of the merits of the case, due to a conflict in the factual position and the necessity to hear evidence.5 By reason of s 170CFA(4) and (6) of the Workplace Relations Act , the applicant then had seven days from 6 February 2004, ie until 13 February 2004, to lodge a document containing an election to take court proceedings, if he wished to do so.The applicant lodged his election on 6 February 2004, stating that he wished to proceed in this Court in respect of the grounds under both ss 170CK and 170CM.By reason of s 170CP(6), he then had a period of 14 days, or such further period as the Court might allow, in which to make his application to the Court.The fourteen-day period expired on 20 February 2004.As I have said, the application was not filed until 6 December 2005.6 The respondent, the State of Victoria, by its Department of Education and Training, indicated at the first directions hearing that it wished to seek to have the proceeding dismissed as incompetent.At that directions hearing, I directed the filing of material in support of, and in opposition to, any application to exercise the undoubted power given by s 170CP(6) to enlarge the time within which the application can be made.7 The principles upon which an application for enlargement of time in a case such as this should be determined have been the subject of comment in a number of cases.They are most conveniently set out for present purposes in the judgment of Marshall J in Jennings v Salvation Army [2003] FCA 1193 (2003) 128 IR 366 at [9] , where his Honour quoted from the judgment of a Full Court of the Industrial Relations Court of Australia in Roger Coyne v Ansett Transport Industries (unreported, Industrial Relations Court of Australia, Wilcox CJ, Ryan and Madgwick JJ, 24 September 1996).The principles so quoted are as follows:   \\'1.Special circumstances are not necessary but the Court must be  positively satisfied that the prescribed period should be extended.The  prima facie position is that the time limit should be complied with  unless there is an acceptable explanation of the delay which makes it  equitable to extend.  2.Action taken by the applicant to contest the termination, other than  applying under the Act will be relevant.It will show that the decision  to terminate is actively contested.It may favour the granting of an  extension of time.  3.Prejudice to the respondent including prejudice caused by delay will  go against the granting of an extension of time.   4.The mere absence of prejudice to the respondent is an insufficient basis to grant an extension of time.   5.The merits of the substantive application may be taken into account in  determining whether to grant an extension of time.  6.Consideration of fairness as between the applicant and other persons  in a like position are relevant to the exercise of the Court\\'s discretion.\\'   8 I deal first with the lapse of time, and with the question whether there should be an enlargement of time because there has been an acceptable explanation.As I have said the lapse of time involved over one year and nine months from the date when the application should have been filed.A period of that length itself may be sufficient to defeat an application to enlarge time.As McHugh J said in Re Commonwealth of Australia; Ex parte Marks [2000] HCA 67 (2000) 177 ALR 491 at [16] , when dealing with an application to extend time limits imposed by the High Court Rules in respect of relief under s 75(v) of the Constitution :   \\'Independently of the merits of the case, I find it difficult to see how a person who, with knowledge of the decision, delays 17 months before seeking relief could ever be granted an extension of time to quash such a decision unless some conduct of the respondent or the public body or official had brought about the delay.As the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council said in Ratnam v Cumarasamy [ [1965] 1 WLR 8 at 12 ], \"[t]he rules of court must prima facie be obeyed.\"...In all but very exceptional cases, they should be rigidly applied when, as here, more than one year has elapsed between the decision and the commencement of proceedings in this court.\\'   9 The applicant\\'s explanation of the delay has involved a number of issues.I accept that he is an unrepresented litigant, with no knowledge of the law.It is clear, however, that he had taken two steps in the Commission, instituting his proceeding there and appealing to the Full Bench, both of which involved time limits.Together with his certificate dated 6 February 2004, the applicant was given a note, making it clear to him that it was incumbent upon him to commence proceedings before an appropriate Court, and that lodgement of a notice of election did not have the effect of commencing any Court proceedings.Perhaps regrettably, the notice did not advise that there was a time limit attached to the commencement of proceedings in the Court, much less what that time limit in fact entailed.10 The applicant, in his material, was inclined to blame the respondent for failing to give him advice as to the presence of a time limit, or its duration.It was no part of the respondent\\'s function to give the applicant such advice.It was no part of the respondent\\'s function to anticipate that the applicant would wish to bring proceedings in the Court.In particular, it was no part of the respondent\\'s function to encourage the bringing of those proceedings, and the consequent expenditure of public money.11 The applicant relied in part on the fact that he had been misled by the fact that the respondent had commenced a proceeding in the High Court of Australia, challenging the correctness of the decision of the Full Bench of the Commission and, with the applicant\\'s consent, had that proceeding remitted to this Court.That proceeding was discontinued by the respondent on 8 April 2005, by filing a notice of discontinuance in this Court.To the extent to which the applicant might have been misled by the continuance of that proceeding up until that time, he could not have been misled after that time by that proceeding.Almost eight months elapsed after the discontinuance of that proceeding, before the applicant commenced his present proceeding in this Court.12 The applicant told me from the bar table that it was not until four weeks before he commenced this proceeding that he spoke to a lawyer.He apparently spoke to a lawyer of his acquaintance about another matter, and the issue of his dismissal from employment was raised incidentally.He then received advice, so he told me, that there was a time limit attached to the bringing of a proceeding of this kind and that the time limit was well and truly exceeded.Notwithstanding this advice, it was another four weeks before the applicant filed his proceeding in this Court.That is a period double the time limit provided for in the statute.13 The applicant relied primarily on the proposition that he is a very heavily committed, and very busy, person.He is, so he said, the head of intelligence for an organisation known as the Jewish Defence League, which has the task of investigating and dealing with Muslim and Arab terrorist threats and neo-Nazi groups throughout the world.He told me that he is one of 16 people involved in that organisation in Australia, but there are many more elsewhere in the world.It is apparently an unpaid job, but a very demanding one, and draws on what the applicant said is his background in military intelligence.Much of this it is necessary for me to take on faith, because it is not dealt with in any detail in the applicant\\'s affidavit material, but I accept the fact that the applicant is very heavily committed and very busy.To some extent, however, there is an issue of priorities involved.Even the busiest person will find time to do something that has to be done before a time limit expires.14 I should also mention that the applicant revealed to me that, since 2001, he has been enrolled as a law student at Griffith University in Queensland.Apparently that enrolment is more for the purpose of obtaining a library card, and using the resources of the university, than it is for actually studying law.The point that I take from it is that the applicant had available to him library facilities that, at the very least, would have enabled him to investigate the issue of time limits, had he chosen to do so.15 The second principle quoted by Marshall J in Jennings relates to action taken otherwise than in the Court to contest the termination.There is no material before me suggesting that the applicant has in any way done anything that would have kept the respondent informed of the proposition that he regarded the issue of his termination of employment as still a live one.16 The next two principles involve the issue of prejudice to the respondent.The respondent attempted to make a case of prejudice arising from the delay.According to its affidavit material, both the principal of Lilydale High School at the time, and the officer who signed the letter of dismissal, are no longer employed by the Department of Education and Training.The affidavit does not say that it is impossible to obtain information from those persons for the purpose of instructing counsel and solicitors in the case.Nor does the affidavit material indicate that those persons will be unavailable to give evidence, or will have no recollection of the circumstances of the dismissal.The affidavit material also says that the respondent discontinued the earlier proceeding in this Court, remitted from the High Court, on the basis that the applicant had not taken any steps to pursue his claim since filing his notice of election on 6 February 2004.The reason for discontinuing the proceeding was that the respondent considered the expenditure associated with prosecuting the proceeding to be unjustified.Counsel for the respondent conceded today that any point that might have been raised in that case, as to want of jurisdiction in the Commission, could be raised in the present proceeding, as to want of jurisdiction in the Court.There appears to me to be no reason why the same point could not be agitated in this proceeding.Given the application of s 347 of the Workplace Relations Act , which would prevent the successful party from claiming costs of a proceeding in most circumstances, it is difficult for me to see how the discontinuance of that earlier proceeding, in reliance on the applicant\\'s failure to institute the proceeding he has now instituted, could be said to amount to prejudice.I therefore proceed on the basis that the respondent has suffered no prejudice, but taking into account the fourth principle from Jennings , which is that the mere absence of prejudice is an insufficient basis to grant an extension of time.17 The fifth principle relates to the merits of the proceeding.The applicant made it very clear that he is particularly interested in attempting to demolish the validity of the ground that was given as the reason for his termination.That ground, of course, was the making of a false statutory declaration as to prior convictions.I drew to his attention that, even if he were able to establish that that ground was entirely false, that would not itself bring him success in the proceeding.His proceeding in this Court is necessarily confined to the particular grounds that he has raised.Under s 170CK of the Workplace Relations Act , the applicant claims that he was dismissed for reasons that included those found in subs (2)(f) of that section, particularly political opinion, national extraction or social origin.In substance, the applicant claims that he was discriminated against and dismissed in consequence of the fact that he holds his position in the Jewish Defence League, and the fact that he is the illegitimate son of Adolf Hitler, thereby giving rise respectively to the grounds of political opinion on the one hand and national extraction or social origin on the other.18 There is no doubt that, at the time leading up to the dismissal, there was considerable publicity about the applicant\\'s involvement with the Jewish Defence League and his claims as to his biological origins.The matter was, as the applicant put it, leaked to the Herald Sun newspaper by a fellow teacher, after one of the students at the school had discovered evidence of it whilst researching for a school project on the internet.The Herald Sun sensationalised the issues by suggesting that the applicant was a terrorist, or someone associated with terrorists, working in the school system in Victoria.The matter was also taken up on a radio station, 3AW, by one of its hosts, Neil Mitchell, who apparently interviewed the Minister for Education and Training, Ms Lynne Kosky, and, as the applicant put it, \\'seriously embarrassed\\' her.19 The applicant would therefore seek to make the case that the Minister had a direct hand in the dismissal, and that it was done for reasons of his involvement in the Jewish Defence League and his biological origins, being his national extraction or social origin.On these issues counsel for the respondent conceded that the respondent would carry the onus of proof.That is to say, it would be necessary for the respondent to prove on the balance of probabilities that whoever made the decision to dismiss the applicant from his employment did not have as a reason for that decision the applicant\\'s political opinion, or his national extraction or social origin.There is material before the Court in which it is suggested that the only reason for the dismissal was the applicant\\'s conviction for several offences in November 2002 and his failure to reveal those convictions in his statutory declaration.There is, however, one sentence in the briefing paper to the person advanced by the respondent as the decision-maker, drawing attention to the publicity surrounding the applicant\\'s continuing employment.On the assumption that the decision-maker was aware of the nature of the publicity, this gives rise to the possibility that, at least, the respondent would have to go into evidence in order to attempt to satisfy the onus of proof.20 One further matter about the merits needs to be mentioned and that is as to the relief sought by the applicant.Given that the employment was for a limited duration and, as I have said, due to expire in June 2003, it could not be said that reinstatement in employment was any longer a possibility.The position that the applicant occupied has gone and it would not seem possible for the Court to compel the respondent to create another position for him.The temporary nature of the position would seem to preclude that.As far as compensation is concerned, it would also seem fairly clear that the maximum compensation that the applicant could hope to achieve would be the remuneration that he had lost for the remainder of that term of employment, as a result of the dismissal.The amount of money at stake would therefore not appear to be very significant.Indeed it might be the case that, if the applicant were represented by lawyers, as he is not, he would find himself out of pocket at the end of the day, even if he were to succeed, because he could not also claim costs, having regard to s 347.21 There appears to be no substance in the ground raising contravention of s 170CM of the Workplace Relations Act , because the applicant appears to have been given pay in lieu of the period of notice required under that section.22 The sixth of the principles that were considered in Jennings does not appear to be applicable in the present case.23 It therefore appears to me that I have to decide whether to grant the applicant the extension of time he seeks by balancing, on the one hand, the very long and not very satisfactorily explained delay before commencement of proceedings and, on the other hand, the prospect of success that might arise from the fact that the respondent would carry the onus of proof on the grounds under s 170CK of the Workplace Relations Act .The balance is therefore between the serious lapse of time and the possibility of success, arising from the fact that the respondent has the onus of proof on the crucial issues, and there is some slight evidence that at least the circumstances that the applicant claims were the reasons for his dismissal might have been present in the mind of the decision-maker.It is a difficult balance to make, because it is a balance between two different things.What tips it seems to me to be the relatively inconsequential nature of any relief that the applicant could claim if he were successful.As I have said, in any event, a relatively small amount of money would seem to be all that he could claim successfully, and even that might be subject to questions of duties to mitigate loss and damage, and so forth.24 As the first of the principles which are quoted in Jennings says, the prima facie position is that the time limit should be complied with unless there is an acceptable explanation of the delay which makes it equitable to extend it.Having regard to the proposition found in the judgment of McHugh J to which I referred earlier, it seems unlikely, in the circumstances of a case such as the present, that it would ever be regarded as equitable to extend a time limit to the extent required in the present case.25 For those reasons, I refuse to grant to the applicant the extension of time that he seeks.It follows that it will be necessary for me to dismiss his application.26 The orders that I make are: 1.The application for an extension of time in which to commence the proceeding be dismissed.2.The application filed on 6 December 2005 be dismissed.I certify that the preceding twenty-six (26) numbered paragraphs are a true

What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun? - I\\'m a federal marshal and you\\'re under arrest. - That\\'s probably all the hacks. Why don\\'t we talk about this later? Watch your head. I\\'m in. Let\\'s go! - Hey! You comfy? - If I could have a little more room... Well, there isn\\'t any. We got a lot of shit in here. We got handcuffs in here. What\\'s in this can? That\\'s for your breath. You could use it... squirt some in your mouth. Yeah, well, that\\'s mace, isn\\'t it? All right, you! Get... Hey. Where\\'s your gun... pistol? In my bag, in the car. Boy, it stunk in there. I believe it. You\\'re ruining a $900 suit my dad gave me. Yeah, it went great with that 12-gauge too. Why in the world would someone like you become a federal marshal? - The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me. - Sorry, what was that? Guys like me? Let me tell you something. Even though I\\'ve been celibate lately, I\\'m not going to force myself on you. - I\\'ve never done that in my life. - You wouldn\\'t have time, anyway. We come to a roadblock, they run the car and find out who it belongs to. That\\'s if they get set up in time, which I doubt. If they do, they\\'ll be lookin\\' for a bunch of little Latin fellas, not a big black guy drivin\\' a Ford. He must be quite a pal, to risk his own ass like this. Buddy? Yeah, he\\'s a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he used to call his sister every week, without fail. She\\'s a born-again Christian. She does bookkeeping for a televangelist. He\\'d call her up, confess his sins. He\\'d tell her whatever bank he happened to rob at the time. Buddy... that his given name? The one I gave him, yeah. So, what\\'s your name? Be in the paper tomorrow, anyway. Jack Foley. You\\'ve probably heard of me. - Why? Are you famous? - The time I was convicted in California, the F.B.I. Told me that I\\'d robbed more banks than anybody in the computer. - How many was that? - Tell you the truth, I don\\'t really know. Started when I was 18 years old, driving for my Uncle Cully, and his partner, Gus. So, basically you\\'re saying you spent half your life in prison. Basically, yeah. I go back, I do 30 years. No time off. - You imagine lookin\\' at that? - I don\\'t have to. I don\\'t rob banks. You don\\'t seem all that scared. - Of course I am. - You don\\'t act like it. What do you want me to do, scream? That wouldn\\'t help much, anyway. No, I\\'m just gonna sit here, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up. You sound like my ex-wife. - You were married? - Just for about a year, give or take a few days. It\\'s not like we didn\\'t get along... we had fun. We just... didn\\'t have... that thing, you know, that uh... - That spark, you know? Gotta have that. - Mm-hmm. - We still talk, though. - Sure. This is not gonna end well. These things never do. If it turns out I get shot like a dog, it\\'s gonna be in the street, not off a goddamn fence. You must really see yourself as some kind of Clyde Barrow, huh? - You mean, of Bonnie and Clyde? - Yeah. The part in the movie where they get shot, when it\\'s Warren Beatty and... - Faye Dunaway. - Faye Dunaway, yeah. - I like her in that movie about TV. - Network, yeah, she was good. And that guy says he\\'s not gonna take any more shit from anybody. - Peter Finch. - Yeah! Peter Finch. \"I\\'m mad as hell, and I\\'m not gonna take any more of your shit!\" In that part where they get shot, I can remember thinkin\\' to myself, thinkin\\', \"Hey, that wouldn\\'t be such a bad way to go, if you had to.\" You sure are easy to talk to. I was thinkin\\', if we met under different circumstances... if you were in a bar and I came up and we started talkin\\'... - I wonder what would happen. - Nothing. - If you didn\\'t know who I was. - You\\'d probably tell me. - Just saying if we met under different circumstances... - You have got to be kidding. Yeah. Yeah. Another movie I liked with Faye Dunaway was Three Days of the Condor. The one with Robert Redford when he was young. Yeah. You know, I never thought it made sense, though... you know, the way they got together so quick. Why not? - I mean, romantically. - Mm-hmm. Well, but it... if... uh. All right. Here we go. All right. Where the hell are we? At the turnpike. Glenn\\'s right above us with the other car. - All right, c\\'mon. Hop on out. - Turn around and get your hands up! Shit! We may as well leave her. We\\'re leavin\\' the car... and we gotta leave her someplace, anyway... what\\'s the difference where? - She\\'s comin\\' with us. - Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there? - Look for a name. - I already looked. Her name is Karen Sisco. Like the Cisco Kid, only spelled different. S-I-S-C-O. Karen? All right, Karen? You be a good girl, now. I\\'m gonna open up the trunk. Hey, hey, hey, now! Now, you\\'re puttin\\' holes in your car! I\\'m not leavin\\' you. I\\'m gonna open the trunk enough for you to drop your pistol out. Now, if you shoot, Buddy\\'s got your shotgun, he\\'s gonna shoot back. There\\'s nothin\\' I can do about it, so it\\'s up to you. Hey. Don\\'t! It\\'s Glenn! Whoa! Fuck! Hey, hey, Jack. Good to see you, man. What the fuck are you guys shooting at? - Do we need \\'im? - The cop saw this car. - He might tie it to the break and turn around. - All right. - Hey, Studs. We didn\\'t recognize ya. - Hey, \"Studs,\" man. I haven\\'t heard that since Lompoc, man. So what\\'s goin\\' on? Aw, nothin\\'. Karen. Are you comin\\' out? - You hear that? - Okay! Okay. You win, Jack. Now, you get your clothes cleaned, you send me the bill. I\\'ll send it to you at Glades. What, did you crawl through a sewer, man? Who\\'re you? - Take your sunglasses off. - I see better with \\'em on, man. You don\\'t take \\'em off I\\'m gonna throw them off while they\\'re still on your head. - Go wait in the car. - Um, we\\'re in civilization now, so you can ease up a little bit. I\\'m sorry. I\\'d like you to wait in the car, please. Take her, put her in the back. - Okay. In the trunk? - In the backseat! In the backseat! - Backseat. Okay, you gotta come now, \\'cause I gotta do this... - Gimme your jacket. Somebody forgot to bring the clean clothes. I brought \\'em. They\\'re at Glades in the back of the Cadillac. You decided to jump into the trunk of her car. You can blame me if you want. I don\\'t mind. - Here, sir. - I\\'ll tell you... - What\\'s your problem, Jack? - I don\\'t know why you got Glenn involved in this. - How \\'bout the score was his idea to begin with? - Idea... The guy\\'s got a fuckin\\' vacant lot for a head. He thinks he can talk to me like that? Shit. \"Gimme your jacket.\" I have been sitting here for over a half-hour, watchin\\' out for the Highway Patrol, if you think that\\'s fun. God. You know, I hadda go over there in the bushes... to smoke a joint, just so I could like, you know? Yep. I got somethin\\' big lined up, up north. Yeah, these guys? Wouldn\\'t even fuckin\\' know about it if it wasn\\'t for me. - Every time he opens his mouth, I wanna punch him out. - He\\'s not the problem, Jack. You wanna pull your head outta your ass, tell me why the hell we\\'re bringing her with us? Glenn. You don\\'t remember me, do you? Um, couldn\\'t have been Glades if that\\'s what you\\'re thinkin\\', \\'cause I was never out there. - No, that\\'s not what I\\'m thinking. - Oh, yeah? But you\\'re sure we\\'ve met, huh? Last fall. I drove you from the Palm Beach County Jail to the federal courthouse... twice. You\\'re Glenn Michaels. I never forget anybody I\\'ve cuffed and shackled. Now let\\'s think about this for a minute, Glenn, see if we can\\'t work it out. Do we have a gun in the car? Oh, shit! I remember you! Hey! Foley\\'s not gonna make it, and if he goes down, you go with him. - Now, look. I can understand if you guys are close, but... - No, we\\'re not. - But, yeah. I\\'m helpin\\' him. - Now wait a minute, Glenn. Have you helped him? I mean, technically, at this point, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice. You wanna take her to my place, get cleaned up, come out of the bathroom... with your aftershave on, and she goes, \"Oh. I had you all wrong.\" No. I just wanna talk to her again, that\\'s all. I just wanna see what it might have been like under normal circumstances. It\\'s too late for that, Jack. He wants to get out of here, and I don\\'t blame him. Ref don\\'t call it soon, Snoop\\'s gonna send this cat out in a body bag. Anybody ever tell you why they call him \"Snoopy\"? He used to be Maurice \"Mad Dog\" Miller... back when he was a pro. Now you pet him, he goes down. - I don\\'t believe it! - Oh, my! Bullshit! Bullshit! Yeah, you the man. Guy\\'s bragging he won a thrown fight. Fuckin\\' pathetic. Dangerous is what it is. - Who\\'s the bald dude? - Richard Ripley. The Wall Street guy? Call him Dick The Ripper on account of all the guys he ripped off. Oh, yeah. I didn\\'t recognize him without his rug. - What\\'s his bid? - Three years. You guys on the bench? Okay. Three years, fined $50 million and wrote \\'em a fuckin\\' check. Just like that. Fifty mill, signed his name. Didn\\'t even... Didn\\'t even... Okay, a little help. Okay, heavy! Heavy! Come on! All the bright glare out here, you couldn\\'t read the numbers on the weights. Oh. I had it. Jesus. - How do you know he wrote a check? - Uh, he told me. We work laundry together. Guy loves to fucking talk. Yeah, he loves to talk. He talked to the U.S. Attorney. Rolled over on all the snitches he was doing business with. Hey! Any guy who can write a fuckin\\' check for $50 million, he says anything, I\\'m all fuckin\\' ears. Guy tells me he\\'s got all this money in foreign banks. Plus, around, mmm, five million in uncut diamonds at his house. He said, quote, that I can get my hands on it at any time. - Where does he live? - Detroit. Snoopy Miller says that uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash. Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? Looks just like a plain, old rock. Wait, you think this guy\\'s lying? What do you think, Studs? Use your head. Some guy\\'s got $5 million... socked away in his house, and he\\'s gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it. Oh, I see. You guys are cynical. Right. Here it comes. Keep on walking. Keep walking. You don\\'t wanna be answering any questions. I\\'m just saying she wasn\\'t scared, that\\'s all. That\\'s \\'cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time waitin\\' to make her move. You\\'re just jealous \\'cause it was me in the trunk with her... - and not you. - You\\'re right. The first thing I\\'m gonna do... is get this mud off me. Hey. Karen? Karen, honey? Karen? You were talking in your sleep. What\\'d I say? \"Hey, yourself.\" Huh. Hello, Daniel. Daniel Burdon, F.B.I. Marshall Sisco, Karen\\'s dad. - Hmm. - Hmm. Umm... Would you mind, please, waiting outside? We have some business to do here. Well, uh, I have to use the john anyway. - Excuse me. - Yeah. I wanna be on the task force, Daniel. Well... That\\'s nice of you to offer, Karen, but... I got all the help I can use right now. Instead, let\\'s talk about how you got that bump on your head. Isn\\'t that my file you\\'re holding on to? Yes, but I want to hear it from you, starting... with when you grabbed the wheel. Where was this? Coming to the Okeechobee exit. - Sit back! - Can you see with those glasses on? I\\'m fine! This is... stupid, man. These guys are gonna be so disappointed in me, man. You know what? If I wasn\\'t stoned, there is no way that you would have talked me into this. - Remember that. - Get off at the exit right after that bridge. No, I am not fucking turning myself in, so forget it! - Get off at that exit! - What exit? - That exit right there. Take that exit! - Sit back! No! The next thing I knew, the paramedics were pulling me out of the car. You all right? - There\\'s a couple of points I keep wondering about... have to do with the two guys that grabbed you. Buddy, is it? And this fella Jack Foley. I swear, the man must have robbed over 200 banks in his time. - Really? - Um-hmm. He told me he didn\\'t remember how many he robbed. Then you talked to him. In the trunk, yeah. What\\'d you talk about? Different things. Prison, movies. This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies? It was an unusual experience. You know, Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman. The one that you were seeing, it turns out, the same time he was robbing banks. - Do you recall that? - And what happened to Carl? The time came, you shot him. But you didn\\'t shoot Foley or the guy with him. They\\'re unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay. Now you got your Sig in your hand, and you say in the report that you couldn\\'t turn around. He had you pinned down. But when the trunk opened, how come you didn\\'t cap the two guys then? What do you work on most of the time? Fraud? Go after crooked bookkeepers? Karen, I\\'ve been with the bureau 15 years on all kinds of investigations. - Have you ever shot a man? - No. - When was the last time you were primary through the door? - I have to qualify? You have to know what you\\'re talking about. We\\'ll talk another time. All right, Karen? I\\'d like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn\\'t need you anymore. You\\'ll have to ask him that. Rip, Rip. - What the deal is, baby? - Hi, Maurice. - Oops. I don\\'t know. - Make a fist... - There you go. - Fuck it, man. - Got your little fishies for you. - Oh, good. Not so fast. Starting out, there\\'s gonna be an across the board cost of living increase. - What? - When I got put in here a year ago on credit card fraud, I didn\\'t really get no props for that. But ever since I shanked that loudmouth pussy in the yard, it\\'s like my Dun and Broadstreet around this bitch done shot way the fuck up. Actually, it\\'s Dun and Bradstreet. That\\'s the, uh... Well, I\\'ve heard it both ways. Point is that the price has gone up around this bitch too. Get your little black book out. We got some business to talk about. For the little fishies... What\\'d I say they was gonna be? - Two thousand. - Now they\\'re gonna be three thousand. - Come on. You... - Now they\\'re gonna be three thousand. That saltwater shit you put in your eyes? - What do you call that? - Bausch & Lomb. Yeah, that bushy lawn shit. That\\'s 300. - I need it. - Yeah, you do. And that extra pillow. I\\'m gonna get that for you, but that\\'s gonna be like five C\\'s. - Five? - Hey. Sign says shut the fuck up, or can\\'t you fellas read? Who the fuck you talkin\\' to, man? You got a problem over there, Foley? Yeah, this is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dumb shakedowns. - Five hundred bucks for a pillow? - That\\'s right. - It does seem a little high, doesn\\'t it? - Shut up, Dick. - Must be a nice pillow. - Full goose down. - Look, you still... - How much for your company at chow? My company? Come on, man. You know I\\'ll watch this motherfucker\\'s back. - How much? - That\\'s a C-note. If you\\'re smart, Ripley, you\\'ll tell this guy to fuck off. Really? Well, I... I... I don\\'t know. First of all, if he kills you, then he\\'s gonna get nothin\\'. Well, uh, the man don\\'t just have to die, Foley. He could accidentally hurt himself falling down on something real hard. Like a shiv or my dick. I\\'ll pay. I\\'ll pay it. Don\\'t worry. If he falls on anything, Snoop, then they\\'re gonna transfer his ass outta here faster than you can throw a fight... and you\\'re still gonna get nothin\\'. You know, last time I checked, man, this shit over here ain\\'t got nothin\\' to do with you. Why don\\'t you go outside? Smoke a cigarette or some shit. I don\\'t smoke. You heard the man. Why don\\'t you get your punk ass up outta here? - Uh-oh. - You fucked up now, man. That\\'s Himey. Protégé of mine. Ranked number 32 in the federal prison system. - Thirty-two? - That\\'s right. - Out of, what, 20. - Kick this cracker\\'s ass. - What\\'s going on here? - Uh, nothin\\'. Just \"reading is fundamental\" shit. We got all excited and everything. Clear outta here. Now. - No problem. - All of you. Let\\'s go. Uh, Snoopy. I think we settled the fish thing. Oh, the fish. Yeah. That\\'s how you do the shake, partner. Paper says there\\'s ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu. They say anything about Karen? Just that she got away. Here. - Hmm? - Jack! - Hey! - That\\'s all right. It\\'s in the pool. Did it say what happened to her after she took off with Glenn? I don\\'t know. You\\'ll have to ask Glenn. He\\'s probably on his way to Detroit, which is where we should be. - Yeah. - Do you realize what you\\'re doing? Worrying about a woman who works for law enforcement? You wanna sit down and have cocktails with a woman who tried to shoot you. - Do you hear what I\\'m saying? - Do you think this old guy\\'s her boyfriend? It\\'s the only picture she has in here. Am I going to Detroit by myself? The longer we stay here, the better chance there is... that either Glenn is gonna screw up the score, or we gonna get busted or both. This is Foley? - Karen? - Hmm? - This is Foley? - (music) How lucky can one guy be (music) - (music) - Doesn\\'t even look like that. - Oh, no? - Uh-uh. He looks a lot like... Different. Wyatt Earp is here. - Hey. - Hey. - How you feelin\\'? Feel better? - Good. Yeah. - Is your dad taking good care of you? - He took the week off... to take care of me and he\\'s worked on his boat every day since. - Dad, this is Ray Nicolet. - Hi. - Pleasure to meet you. I heard a lot about you. - Likewise. Ray\\'s working with the F.B.I. Task force on the prison break. I see that. Tell me, Ray, do you ever wear one that says \"undercover\"? - No. - How\\'s it going? Sit down. Okay. Good. We caught one of them. - Was it Foley? - Was it off a tip? Somebody spotted two of them out in this hobo camp near the airport. Called in the number. That was it. - I knew it as soon as I as there was a reward. - Was it Foley? No, Linares, one of the Cubans. We went in there with full SWAT, two choppers, that whole deal. Linares goes nuts, starts shooting, so we took him out. I don\\'t know how Chirino got away, but he did. - And Foley hadn\\'t been there. - No, this place was strictly Cuban. Foley had a ride. He must have his own agenda. You know what I mean? He seems to be the only guy who kinda knows what he\\'s doing. Uh-huh. - Excuse me. - Yeah. Hello? Yeah, she is. Just a minute, please. Karen. - Hello? - Hi. You know who this is? Yes. Five minutes. So. Ray. - Yeah. - There\\'s something I\\'m wondering. The headline reads, \"I slept with a murderer, says shaken Miami woman.\" - Who is it that answered the phone? - None of your business. I\\'m just worried maybe I\\'m not old enough for you. - It was my dad. - Really? - He\\'s got a cop\\'s face. - How do you know? - Oh, wait. You have my wallet. - And your gun. - Think I can have \\'em back? - How do we do that? You can come by my dad\\'s place and drop \\'em off. I could leave it with the SWAT guy that answers the door. There\\'s a guy here on the task force right now. Maybe I should put him on the phone and let the two of you work it out. - You wouldn\\'t do that. - Why not? Because you\\'re having too much fun. She fixes him pork chops and rice. The next thing you know, they\\'re making love on the sofa. She says he was very gentle. This guy, Chirino, shows up at the house, says he misses his little girl. She feels sorry for him. Next thing you know... boom. - On the couch. - That\\'s how you score now, huh? I guess. There\\'s something I\\'ve been wondering. Whatever happened to your Uncle Cully? You think he\\'s gonna tell you where I am? - Unless you wanna tell me. - He\\'s dead. Did 27 years before he got out, and he died a couple of years afterwards in a charity hospital... by trying to make up for all the good times he missed. That\\'s not gonna be me. What, one last score, retire to some island? Is that the idea? - Jack. - I\\'m partial to mountains myself, but if you like islands, we\\'ll make it an island. - What do you mean, \"we\\'ll make it an island\"? - You and I can make it... - Jack, you better come and check this out. - Is that Buddy? - What? No. Okay. Bye-bye. - Who\\'re you talking to? - So she\\'s a married woman. - Right. But she goes to bed with a prison escapee because... he tells her that he misses his little girl. She tells the world about it. But you protect her. You don\\'t reveal her name. That makes it sound like what she was doing was okay... as long as her husband doesn\\'t find out. Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn\\'t know won\\'t bother her. - Dad. - What? Ray, I wanna show you something... in the living room. - Yeah. - Good talking to you, Ray. Yeah, you too. Federal law enforcement agents raided a squatters camp... north of Miami International Airport this morning... in the hopes of capturing a fugitive from Tuesday\\'s daring escape from Glades prison. F.B.I. Officials confirm that one of the escapees, Arelio Linares, was killed... - Chino\\'s gonna wanna talk to me. Chino\\'s runnin\\' for his life. He don\\'t give a shit about you. He\\'s gonna know by now I gave him up back at Glades. He\\'s gonna wanna find me. Maybe see Adele, see what she knows. He knows where she lives? Jack! We were talking once, drinking rum, and I may have mentioned Adele. How she worked for a magician. Chino got all interested. He said, \"How do you saw the woman in half?\" Maybe he wanted to meet her, maybe see her if she came to visit. Oh, okay, okay. So you call her up and tell her don\\'t talk to any Cubans. - The phone\\'s probably tapped by now. - You\\'re right. And if the phone is tapped, you know they have her place staked out. Shit! Adele Delisi speaking. - Uh, uh, this is Adele? - Yes, it is. Oh... Uh, sorry. Wrong number. Nice disguise. I\\'m a tourist. All right. Here we go. Coming up right here... on the left. - What about the guy with the clippers? - I wonder what the F.B.I... is charging to trim hedges these days? - Quite a checker game they got goin\\' on too. - Pull on up. Oh, man. Oh, man. Okay, you saw her. That\\'s all you get. - Let\\'s go to Detroit. - Now you\\'re talkin\\', brother. I\\'ll say one thing for Jack... he\\'s very considerate. Lights on or off, if you know what I mean. - Really. - Hmm. Adele, listen... I just want to find him before he does something else and makes it worse on himself. No. Buddy\\'ll take care of him. Keep him out of trouble. He\\'s Jack\\'s conscience, always has been. They must have robbed 50 banks together. - They were a really great team. - Until they got busted. Hmm. That wasn\\'t Jack\\'s fault, no, that was on account of... Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to the job... before they\\'d done it instead of after. Well, she called the F.B.I. They both went down, and they ended up at Lompoc. I think Buddy felt kind of bad about that. Adele, do you have any idea where I could find Buddy? Or Glenn? Mira, Adele, you in there? - Yes. - Mira, I\\'d like to speak to you, please. - Well, who is it? - Emile, you know, the guy you used to work for? - Uh... - He gave me your number and where you live. Mira, I\\'m looking for an assistant. Can I speak to you, please? - Oh. Uh, yeah. - All right. You did work for Emile, right? Uh, yeah, I was Emile\\'s box jumper for four years, almost. Cono! You were what, his box? - Uh, his assistant. - Oh, okay. You say you perform in the Miami area? Oh, si. Here, there, you know. I was a magician in Cuba. They used to call me Manuelito the Magician. Mira, can you please open? - I\\'m not dressed. - I\\'m a good friend of Jack Foley. - You know Jack? - Who are you? Jose Chirino. Or maybe you heard Jack call me Chino. Bueno, I\\'m the same guy. Tell him he has to wait in the hall. You have to get dressed. Say it loud. Wait in the hall. You have to get dressed. Mira, mira, you tell me where I could find Jack and I don\\'t bother you no more. Now, come on, please! Hello? - I don\\'t know where he is. - I\\'m the guy that helped Jack escape from prison. - Mira, please open this fucking door... - I\\'m gonna call the police. Cono, why you gonna do that to a friend, man? A partner to Jack? That\\'s it! That\\'s it! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Cono, mira, please! - Adele! Adele! - Give me your hand. - You not Adele! - I\\'m a federal marshal, and you\\'re under arrest. - Get my bag, Adele. - Oh. Mira, please, please. I think there\\'s a misunderstanding here. Can you... you got nice bag. Mira, let\\'s say we just forget about it, okay? We forget about this, I go home... - Shut up. - Owwww! Who the hell taught you how to do that? - Give me your other hand. - Okay, okay. Ay, cono. Ohhhh! I gotta go make pee-pee. Ohhhhh! Owww! Wow! You are mean! Look, I\\'m gonna call my lawyer. This is... What do they call that? Human rights violation. - Ay, cono. - Daniel Burdon, please. Karen Sisco. Mira, Adele, Adele. Can I ask you a question, please? You know that trick you do? Karen? Where are you? I\\'ve been trying to reach you. When you in the box and they saw you in half? - I\\'m at Adele Delisi\\'s. - It\\'s magic. We already talked to her. That\\'s a dead end. I was just wondering, if I brought in Chirino, would you let me be on the task force? - Yeah, sure, Karen. - Then they put the saw through, and they separate it. - And that\\'s it. Ta da. - But how do you twinkle your toes? I don\\'t get that. You bring Chirino in, and you can be on the task force. - That\\'s all I wanted to know. - Good. Now, would you forget about the ex-wife, and get over to the Adams Hotel? - You got it. - Then they open it up... - No! No! - Come on. - And then that\\'s it. - Fake legs. - Mmm. - Fake legs? How you gonna... - Ay! Cono. - Thanks, Adele. How do they twinkle their toes, then, if it\\'s fake, mira? First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn, and we find a window to throw him out of. I was thinkin\\', if I was Glenn, and I was up there... to take down the Ripper, where would I go? \\'Cept that if you were Glenn, you wouldn\\'t be thinkin\\'. Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from the joint? Snoop? I figured he\\'d be brain-dead by now. Nah, Snoop doesn\\'t box anymore. Glenn told me that he\\'s managing some fighters out at the Kronk. - Did you get the key? - They\\'re in room 613. All right. I want two men outside, front and back. Conroy, Jamison, go on up to six, cover both ends of the hall. You\\'re primary. You\\'re secondary. And you\\'re point man. - You gonna use a ram? - Yeah. Why? The manager\\'s door is metal. You know what I mean, they might all be. A ram on a metal door makes a lot of noise for what good it does. I got a shock lock round for my shotgun that oughta do the trick. Fine. Whatever. Two, please. You. Fuck it. Let\\'s take the stairs. Karen... Take the radio. Stay down here in the lobby and watch the elevator. - Daniel, I want to go upstairs. - Well, you can wait in the car if you want to. Now, you see Foley and Bragg coming behind us. What do you do? - Call and tell you? - And you let them come up. You don\\'t try to make the bust yourself. You understand? Is this your floor, ma\\'am? Is this your floor, ma\\'am? Oh. Oh, yes. Yes, it is. I\\'m sorry. Thank you. Be advised we are approaching the door. Be advised we are going to blow the door. Going up? Shit, I thought I was going up. She just looked right at me. - Who? - Karen. - Karen Sisco? - Yeah. She\\'s in the lobby. - She\\'s in the lobby? - Yeah. They know where I live, no doubt they know what I drive. We gotta dump this car. She just sat there, looking right at me. Karen, they\\'re not up here. Keep your eyes open. Karen? Karen, are you there? He waved at you? Couldn\\'t swear to it, but I\\'m pretty sure he did. - Did you wave back? - I didn\\'t have time. I imagine you would have, though. Buddy\\'s sister, Regina Mary Bragg, got two calls from Buddy in Detroit this morning. She calls Burdon. She\\'s also the one who called Burdon... - and gave him Buddy\\'s address. - So? So what I want to know is why he still calls her even after she turned him in. He doesn\\'t seem to hold a grudge. What I want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long? - Any thoughts on that? - None I\\'d like to share. - I\\'ll call you when I get in. - Okay. (music) Hey (music) (music) Time is truly wasting (music) You know, I don\\'t just deal product and manage fighters no more. A lot\\'s changed since the last time you seen me, man. It\\'s like I\\'ve, uh, vertically integrated myself, you know, diversified and shit, and now I\\'m into the occasional grand larceny, - home invasion, shit like that. - Huh. White Boy Bob right there\\'s my all-around man, you know. He\\'s my personal bodyguard when I feel like I need one, driver, shit like that. Yo, man, watch the road, White Boy! What you lookin\\' back here for? - Yeah. - Yeah. - I like this car, Glenn. - Yeah. You stole a good one, boy. You can roll around in Ripley\\'s neighborhood up there in Bloomfield Hills, not get sweated by the private security. Ain\\'t gonna have no police on our ass, nothing like that. It\\'s nice, man. Yeah. Oh, hey, so you still haven\\'t said how you want to do this thing. Oh, I\\'m gonna tell you that as soon as we get one other brother I\\'m gonna need, uh, Kenneth... that\\'s Moselle\\'s brother... along with White Boy right there. - What? - All right, here we go, White Boy. Uh, who\\'s the fireman? Ken dog. - What\\'s up, brother-in-law? - What\\'s happenin\\', hustler? Hey, man. This cigarette gonna bother you, Mo? Yeah, put that thing out, all right? Ken, this is Glenn. - Glenn, that\\'s Kenny, the dude I was tellin\\' you about. - Hi. You\\'re the one gonna help us rip off that rich white dude? - Yeah, that\\'s him. - Help you? Go ahead, White Boy. Um, whoa, wait a minute, um, look... Maurice, I am letting you in on this gig, not... - You just asked how we gonna do it, right? - Yeah. Well, I\\'m telling you how, man. We the experts. Person I\\'m worried about is you, Glenn. - Me? - Yeah. Can you step up and actually do this shit instead of just talking the talk? Do what? Walk into this house I got picked out. Do this cross-dressing nigger named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to. - Been dealing on his own. - What? When, man? Shit, right now, son. What you think all this shit is for? I don\\'t need to prove shit to you, man, okay? The Ripley job is my job. You\\'re either in or you\\'re not. You wanna go pop some crack dealer pissed you off, man, - that is your problem, not mine, fuck! - Glenn, I know you supposed to be cool and everything, okay, but you ain\\'t got to give me no tone of voice. You don\\'t like what I\\'m sayin\\', you just bounce the fuck out this whip anywhere up in here. Okay, I think we\\'re forgetting that this is my whip. I brought it up. Shit. Hey, come on, man. If I say this is my car, you know this is my car. You just get yourself another one. If I say we in on this Ripley shit, we in on it, with or without your punk ass. And if I say you gonna walk up in this house and do this motherfucker... so I can see if you got any balls or not, guess what else you gonna do? We\\'re here. Tighten up your panties, boy. - Hacksaw. Okay, I\\'ll take that. - Oh, yeah. - Hatchet, man. - Hatchet? What are you gonna do with a hatchet? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let\\'s get some fire to that ass. Look here. You want the.45 or the Glock? Glenn? Shit, boy. It was worse than you thought it was gonna be, huh? You with the bad boys now, baby. Let\\'s go. What do you think? I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got ourselves another partner. Hey, Studs, how ya doin\\'? Jesus Christ, what are you guys doin\\' here? Weren\\'t you expecting us? Where\\'s your sunglasses? Somebody finally step on \\'em for ya? - I don\\'t know. - Whose blood you got on your shirt? Listen, man, these guys are crazy. - Snoop! - Shit. We have a problem here? Jack Foley, famous bank robber. Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower. Seems I read somewhere that you broke out of a prison down in Florida. - Is that right? - They got a low class of people there, Snoop. Hey, you call him that again I\\'m gonna put your head through the wall. What? You mean \"Snoop\"? Nobody calls me Snoop or Snoopy anymore is what White Boy Bob is trying to tell you. He\\'s just a little crude with it. You know what I mean? Nah, I left all that behind me, partner. But you call this bozo \"White Boy.\" White Boy Bob used to be a fighter. Oh, so tell me, what do you do now, White Boy Bob, outside of shoot your big mouth off? - Like being back in the yard, isn\\'t it? - Yeah, just like it. Nobody backing down or nothing. You back down, you just a pussy. - Why y\\'all in Detroit anyway, up here in the cold? - Glenn didn\\'t tell you? - Glenn? What? - I thought you guys were busted. Why\\'s that? \\'Cause you left us standing on the side of the road? Whoops. Look, Snoop, I don\\'t know what Glenn promised you, or what you think you\\'re going to get out of this... here\\'s the deal: Buddy and I, we\\'re going to take half of anything we get off of Ripley. Anything else, you guys are allowed to cut up any way you want. Oh. Why don\\'t we talk about this outside, man? - Nice in here. It\\'s warm. - Warm? It\\'s like 90 degrees in here, man. Sometimes it\\'s 100 up in this mug. That\\'s the way Emmanuel like to keep it. Keep his fighters mean and lean like Tommy Hearns. Ain\\'t that right, Kenny? I got someplace to be anyway, so tell you what: Why don\\'t y\\'all come by the fights Friday night? We\\'ll sit down, chop it up, you know, look it over. - State Theater. - All right. We\\'ll see you then. So it must take a lot of balls to walk into a bank and stick it up with a gun, huh? I don\\'t know. I never used a gun before in my life. You\\'re kidding. You\\'d be surprised what all you can get if you ask for it the right way. Well, you\\'re the reason, my friend, that I don\\'t keep all my money in the bank. So where do you keep your money, Dick? Talking about all those uncut diamonds you told about. - I know what you\\'re talking about. - You\\'re the one with balls. Say something like that to somebody like Glenn? Glenn? Come on, nobody\\'s going to believe Glenn. - Do you believe Glenn? - Uh, no, I don\\'t. Besides, even if it was true, he\\'d still have to know where I keep \\'em, wouldn\\'t he? Doesn\\'t have to know anything. You told him you keep \\'em in your house. It\\'s a very big house. So, how much longer you in here for? Uh, 22 months, three days, two hours. - Why? - \\'Cause I could use a guy like you. Somebody that knows how to ask for things in the right way. I\\'m talking about when you\\'re out of here. After all, you can\\'t rob banks forever, can you? - I\\'m not exactly a nine to five type. - Who is? I thought everybody liked Eddie. - How you doin\\', Ray? - I\\'m freezing. But I\\'m getting warmer. So listen, other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together, you want to tell me why you\\'re coming to me instead of the F.B.I.? I go to the F.B.I., the first thing they\\'re gonna do is send me to get some coffee. You know what? You\\'re right. Ray, about a year ago, D.E.A. Had a guy, Glenn Michaels, on possession with intent. - Listen, is that your car? Find out whose it is. - They couldn\\'t make it stick. In his statement, he said he was coming to Detroit to see a friend... about job opportunities, if you can believe that. - What was the name of the friend? - Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, used to be a prizefighter. I know Snoopy. He\\'s a fucking wack job. He thinks he\\'s Sugar Ray Leonard, hangs out over on the west side... with a couple of other first-rate nut cases. - Well, I\\'m gonna need a last known address. - 2710 coming in. - You\\'re gonna need what? - A last known address. That your car? No way. I don\\'t want you talking to Miller alone. Come on, Ray. I\\'m a federal officer. I can handle myself. I\\'m armed. I\\'ll call you tomorrow with the address. Thank you, Raymond. You see the paper? - It\\'s a terrific shot of her. - Outside of that. Doesn\\'t say what she\\'s doing here, but I don\\'t think it has anything to do with us. She came up here on her vacation because she likes shitty weather. Nah, I think she\\'s after Glenn. The girl still there? They don\\'t stay the whole night, Jack, unless you pay for it. - Did you tell your sister? - Yeah, I just hung up. She prayed for me. - Mm-hmm. And how long were you on the phone with her? - Two hours. - And how long were you with the girl? - 45 minutes. You didn\\'t tell your sister about Ripley, did you? Look, Jack, just forget about my sister, okay? Now, if Karen Sisco is tailing Glenn, we\\'re fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights, we all get picked up. Why don\\'t we just drive by where we\\'re meeting tonight, check it out. And we\\'ll go by Ripley\\'s too, while we\\'re at it. - Yeah, all right. - All right. - Athenaeum Hotel, how may I help you? - Karen Sisco, please. - Hello, Best Western. - Karen Sisco, please. - Moselle Miller? - What do you want? - I\\'m looking for Maurice. - You find him, tell him the dog got run over. I\\'m out of grocery money. - Moselle, who you talkin\\' to? - Lady lookin\\' for Maurice. - What does she want? - Hasn\\'t said. - That\\'s not Maurice? - That\\'s Kenneth, my brother. He\\'s talkin\\' on the phone. - Ask her what she want with him! - You ask her! - Maurice business is none of my business. - Yeah, you damn right. State Theater, huh? Who\\'s fightin\\'? Nigger, what? I\\'m looking for somebody I think Maurice knows. You\\'re not with probation, one of those? - No. - You a lawyer? No, I\\'m not. I\\'m looking for somebody named Glenn Michaels. Glenn? I don\\'t know any Glenn. He said he stayed here last November. - Here in this house? - He said he stayed with Maurice. Well, he ain\\'t even here that much. I\\'d like to know where he goes, but at the same time, I don\\'t wanna know, you understand? Yeah. - You say your dog was killed? - Got run over by a car. - What\\'d you call him? - Was a she. Named Tuffy. Where do you think I might find Maurice, Moselle? I don\\'t know. The gym, the fights. I know he don\\'t miss the fights. They\\'re havin\\' some tomorrow down at the State Theater. - He used to take me. - The State Theater. Why you askin\\' all these questions about Maurice? She lookin\\' for a man name of Glenn. Did I ask you? Go on and do something with yourself, Moselle. Why don\\'t you take your ass to Dot and Etta\\'s and get us some shrimp or somethin\\'? - You\\'re a fighter. - How you know that? - I can tell. - Yeah, I was. \\'Til I got my retina detached two times. - What\\'d you fight, about middleweight? - Nah, light. Super middleweight, once my body developed. - What you go about, what, a bantam? - Flyweight. Nigger, what? You know your divisions, huh? Do you like the fights? You like the rough stuff? Yeah, I bet you do. You like to get down and tussle a little bit? Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over. We used to get down on the floor and tussle all the time. I\\'d say to her, \"You a good bitch, Tuffy. Here\\'s a treat for ya.\" And I give Tuffy what all good bitches love best, and you know what that is? Know what that is? A bone. I\\'ll give you a good bone too, girl. You\\'re not my type. No, that shit don\\'t mean nothin\\' to me. - I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants. - I gotta go, Kenneth. - Maybe we\\'ll see each other again. - No, no, we gonna tussle first. Awww! Damn it! What the fuck was that? You wanted to tussle. We tussled. That\\'s a big ass house. Place almost looks like a prison. No doubt he\\'s got some serious security system. Time comes, we go up, knock on the door, see if he wants to talk about old times. - You know, the easy way. - Cool. Think he\\'ll let us in, we got the Snoop and that musclebound asshole with us? Nobody\\'s gonna be with us. I say we go to the fights tomorrow night, see what Snoopy\\'s big plan is, then we go in, ahead of him, alone. Oh, I can dig it. Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we off livin\\' the good life. Good life. Buddy, you know anybody who\\'s done one last big score... and then gone on to live the good life? Look, Jack, there\\'s a chance we\\'ll walk out of here with nothin\\'. I say, let fate decide. Let fate decide? What are you, the fuckin\\' Dalai Lama now? Nah, man, it\\'s my sister. My sister believes in fate but not hell. That\\'s why she stopped praying for all the lost souls, since you don\\'t hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day, she asks her boss to pray that Buddy don\\'t fuck up. I mean, what do you think? - Well... - You think there\\'s a hell? Yeah, it\\'s called the Glades Correctional Institute. I\\'m sure as shit not going back there or any place like it. They put a gun on you, you\\'ll go, brother. They put a gun on you, you still have a choice. So, Mr. Foley, Mr. Ripley and I have had a long discussion about your role in the company, and it was his feeling you\\'d be happiest working down here in Miami. - How\\'s that sound to you? - Sounds great. Good. You\\'re about a 42 long, right? I uh, I\\'m about a 42... like, 42 regular. - Okay, let\\'s see how she fits. - What is that? Your uniform. My uniform. Mr. Foley. Mr. Foley! Sir, sir. Excuse me, sir. Sir! Sir, excuse me! - You can\\'t go in there! - Are you fucking kidding me? A security guard? - What are you, stoned? - Hey, hey! Take it easy! It\\'s all right, Peggy. It\\'s under control. You know something? I wasn\\'t sure that you\\'d show up here, but I was very sure if you did, you\\'d throw this job in my face. Let me tell you something. Every single thing you\\'ve done with your life up until this point... in the real world means nothing. Less than nothing. You\\'re a bank robber. That\\'s not a very marketable skill. We don\\'t see a lot of old bank robbers walking around... with a pension plan, now do we? I think you know this. That\\'s why you\\'re here. Today, I\\'ve offered you... a lousy job with a lousy wage. You want something better? Why don\\'t you show me you can change? Then I\\'ll offer you something better, a lot better. But until then, my friend, you\\'ll have to earn it. How, Dick? The way you earn it? Married some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time then divorcing her? What\\'s this Knute Rockne \"pull yourself up by the bootstraps\" bullshit? Back in prison, a guy like you in a place like that? You were ice cream for freaks. A goddamned dumpling. Maurice and a dozen other guys would have bled you till you had nothing. Until you were nothing. I saved your ass! So you\\'ll pardon me if I don\\'t want to sit on a fucking stool all day, and say, \"Sign in here, please,\" or \"Hey, pal, you can\\'t park here.\" All right, Dick? I can\\'t fuckin\\' do it, Dick! - I\\'m disappointed in you. - You wanna... Oh, here we go. What job did he promise you boys? - There\\'s two ways we can do this. - Yeah, what are they? Hey, Buddy, I gotta get a better pair of shoes and some things for tomorrow. Drop me off by the Ren Center and we\\'ll hook up later? Yeah, okay. I better go call my sister. (music) Can I get you anything? Yeah, I\\'ll have a bourbon, please. Water back. Okay. Hey, Tad, why don\\'t you do us again, please? Oh, and, Celeste, put the lady\\'s drink on our bill. - They want to buy your drink for you. - Yeah, I get that. - Tell them I\\'d rather pay for my own. - Okay. I\\'ll find out. Excuse me. My associates and I, we made a little bet... on what you do for a living. And I won. Hi, I\\'m Phillip. If it\\'s okay with you, Phillip, I\\'d rather just have a quiet drink and leave. Don\\'t you want to know what I guessed? How I know what you do for a living? Really, Phillip, I don\\'t want to be rude. I just want to be left alone. It\\'s a little cold over there. Excuse me. I think I know why you\\'re depressed. If I can offer my observation. See, I got a hunch you\\'re the new sales rep, and the client\\'s not exactly knocked out by the fact that a young lady... even one as stunning as yourself... is handling the account. Am I close? I\\'m Andy. We\\'re all ad guys. Flew in this morning from the apple... New York. Came in to pitch Hiram Walker Distillery. Little test market campaign for the new margarita mix. It\\'s really pretty interesting. We take this, um, Mex... um, Hispanic bandito... with his bullet belts and everything, and the big Chihuahua hat, and he pulls out his six-guns, - and these guys back here... - Andy. Really. Who gives a shit? - Do you want to tell me what happened? - Beat it, Andy. Andy. What\\'d you do? - Can I buy you a drink? - Yeah, I\\'d love one. Sit down. I\\'m Gary. I\\'m Celeste. - It takes forever to get a drink. There\\'s only one waitress. - I can go to the bar. - Oh, don\\'t go. - Are those guys bothering you? No, they\\'re fine. I mean, you just got here. Here, help yourself. - You like bourbon? - I love it. We got that out of the way. Tell me, Celeste, what do you do for a living? I\\'m a sales rep, and I came here to call on a customer, but they gave me a hard time \\'cause I\\'m a girl. Is that how you think of yourself? - As a sales rep? - As a girl. - Yeah, I don\\'t have a problem with it. - I like your hair. - I like your outfit. - Actually, this is my second favorite outfit. I had a first favorite, but it got ruined and I had to get rid of it. - You did? - It smelled. - Really? Having it cleaned didn\\'t help? - No. So tell me, Gary, what do you do for a living? - How far do you want to go with this? - Don\\'t say anything yet. I don\\'t think it works if we\\'re somebody else. I mean, Gary and Celeste, what do they know about anything? - Well, this is your game, I\\'ve never played before. - It\\'s not a game. It\\'s not something you play. Well, does this make any sense to you? It doesn\\'t have to. It\\'s something that happens. It\\'s like seeing someone for the first time... like you could be passing on the street, and you look at each other and for a few seconds... there\\'s this kind of a recognition... like you both know something. The next moment, the person\\'s gone, and it\\'s too late to do anything about it. And you always remember it, because it was there, and you let it go, and you think to yourself, \"What if I had stopped? If I had said something?\" \"What if?\" \"What if?\" And it may only happen a few times in your life. - Or once. - Or once. How\\'d you find me? Uh... Called your room from downstairs. Oh. And if I had answered, what were you gonna say? I would say who I was, and do you remember me, and want to meet for a drink? If I remembered you. I came here looking for you. All right, so then I would have said yes, but for all you know, I could have had a SWAT team waiting for you... why would you trust me? It\\'d be worth the risk. - You like taking risks. - So do you. You know, sooner or later... You really wear that suit. Well, that\\'s not what you were about to say. - Remember how talkative you were in the trunk? - Mm-hmm. - Adele said you do that when you\\'re nervous. - Oh, she did, did she? - You kept touching me, feeling my thigh. - But in a nice way. You know, that Sig you took from me was special. My dad gave it to me for my birthday. Yeah? What were you going to do with me? I hadn\\'t really worked that part out yet. All I knew is that I liked you, and that I didn\\'t wanna... leave you there on the side of the road and never see you again. Then you waved to me in that elevator. Yeah, I wasn\\'t sure if you caught that. I couldn\\'t believe it. By that time I had been... thinking about you a lot... and just wondering what it would be like if we met, if we could take a time-out. I was thinking the same thing. I kept thinking, \"What if we took a time-out?\" If we... just spent some time together. - You know, I saw you on the street. - Where? Outside Adele\\'s. - You went to see her? - To warn her about Chino. - So she did help you. - I don\\'t think we should get into that. You\\'re right. And I won\\'t ask about Buddy, or what you guys are doing in Detroit, or if you\\'ve run into Glenn Michaels yet... Okay, now, don\\'t talk like that, because you scare me. - Let\\'s get out of here. - Yeah. There\\'s something I want you to know. I wasn\\'t just looking for a fuck, if that\\'s what you\\'re thinking. - Or, I was... - Why are you mad? I was looking for some kinky thrill... you know, score with the bank robber. - The way some women go for rough trade... - All right. Now I can say that I fucked a U.S. Marshal. Do you think I will? I don\\'t know. Mm-hmm. Come here. I know a guy... walks into a bank with a bottle, tells everybody it\\'s nitroglycerine. He scores some cash off of the teller. On his way out, he drops the bottle. It cracks on the floor. He slips in it. He smacks up his head. They get him. The nitroglycerine was canola oil. I know more fucked-up bank robbers than ones that know what they\\'re doing. I doubt one in ten could tell you where the dye pack is. Most bank robbers are fucking morons. For you to go to bed with one for kinky thrills, like you were saying, makes you as dumb as they are. Now, you are not dumb. Why would you think that? Why would you think that I would think that? You\\'re not dumb. Well, I don\\'t know about that. I mean, you can\\'t do three falls and think you have much of a brain. Come here. You\\'re getting serious on me now. Tryin\\' not to. I just want to know what\\'s gonna happen. You know. Put it together now. Put it together! Upstairs and downstairs. - He don\\'t want to see you downstairs! - Man, you drink like a bitch! He don\\'t want to see you... Get your tussle on. Joe, get your tussle on! Yeah, don\\'t let him out that corner. Don\\'t let him out, now. Hey, you know what? I gotta go take a pee. What are you tellin\\' us for? You want somebody to hold your pecker? Do that work, Joe! Put it together now, Joe! That\\'s it, baby! Take him deep! Oh, oh, my God, I love it. Put him to sleep, Joe! Put him to sleep, Joe! Sit down, Kenny. That\\'s it! That\\'s it! - You tryin\\' to steal this car, Glenn? - Don\\'t, don\\'t, don\\'t! Oh, my God, I can\\'t believe this! Another one of those days, huh? Nothing seems to be going right. - I don\\'t have the keys to the car. - I see that. No, I mean I am not fucking stealing the car! - You\\'re not? - No, I already stole it a week ago, whenever it was, in West Palm. So I can\\'t be stealing it again, can I? - Put your hands on the wheel, please. - Okay, so now you\\'re gonna... bust me for pickin\\' up a car, what the... For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and for conspiring to do whatever you came here for. Listen to me. These guys, they\\'re gonna be out here any minute looking for me, and they\\'re fucking animals, man. What\\'s going on, Glenn? Nothing. I just wanna get the fuck outta here. I thought this whole thing was your idea. Okay, ripping off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, they are in a whole other level of their own. - Ripley, the Wall Street guy? - Yeah, the plan was... to pick him up at his office tomorrow... and drive him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills. And now I don\\'t give a shit what the guys do, you know? - And Foley was part of this. - Yeah, he\\'s supposed to be, but he hasn\\'t showed up yet, - which is good for him. - Why? Because Maurice is gonna kill him. Like, try to collect the reward money or something. But you say he hasn\\'t shown up yet. You think he backed out? I don\\'t know. He doesn\\'t exactly confide in me. I wonder why. Okay, if you\\'re gonna do this, let\\'s do it and get out of here. I am freezing my ass off! If you wanna get out of here, run. It\\'ll warm you up. Oh, ha, ha. Really? I swear to God, Glenn, if I find out that you are lying to me, I... I know, you will find me. I believe it. Hey, know what I was thinkin\\'? If you didn\\'t drive me to the federal court last summer, you wouldn\\'t even know who I am. If I didn\\'t know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you\\'d be in jail or dead. Think of it that way. Now run. Yeah! Yeah! I\\'m tellin\\' you, man, the money is here. - Snoop. - Hey, it\\'s the bank robbers. Y\\'all missin\\' the fights, man. Pull up a chair. - Who\\'s sittin\\' here? - Oh, that\\'s your homey, Glenn, man. But he bounced to the bathroom a couple minutes ago... - and we ain\\'t seen him since. - Must\\'ve fell in, man. No doubt. Yeah, sent these two looking for him. They came back shaking their heads. Well, if he left his coat and he\\'s been gone a while, then... - Car\\'s here, man. I checked. - Yeah. - All right. We\\'re leavin\\'. - Leavin\\'? - What the fuck, Foley? - Stupid, you know where Glenn is. - Look, what you worried about Glenn for, what he know? - I thought everything. No, Glenn know everything that\\'s supposed to happen tomorrow. Now, he may run and tell somebody that, but that don\\'t mean shit. Glenn don\\'t know I changed the plan. It\\'s happenin\\' tonight. Soon as we leave here. Go back by the house, pick up some shit we gonna need, and we just gonna do it. - Give me a minute to talk to Buddy. - You got two minutes, that\\'s all. - Make up your mind, Foley. - I wasn\\'t asking permission. - You know they\\'re gonna set us up. - I get that feeling, yeah. You think you can get to the diamonds before they do? I\\'ll make you a deal. You get outta here right now. I\\'ll do the job with Snoop. I\\'ll meet you anywhere you want, give you half. - Half for doin\\' what? - Gettin\\' me out of Glades, for starters. Who\\'s gonna watch your back? All right, White Boy. House call. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Ready to do this, baby? - Ready for whatever. Cool. My shit always work. Perennial Plumbing. Somebody in the house called. You don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about, because no one was here. - Let\\'s go skiing. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. You still got time to take me up on my offer. And leave you alone with these assholes? - Raymond Cruz. - Ray, it\\'s Karen Sisco. I\\'m at Ripley\\'s house. I just saw Maurice Miller and four other suspects force their way into the house. They\\'re armed. I\\'m gonna need backup. - Who are you? - I work here. I\\'m the maid. Fuck off! - That\\'s exactly what I\\'m gonna do: Fuck you, then off you. - Hey, not yet. - Where Ripley at? - He isn\\'t here. - Out for the evening or some shit? - He\\'s in Florida... Palm Beach. - When\\'s he due back? - What difference does it make? You gonna wait for him? Mr. Ripley\\'s down for the season. Christmas to Easter. Stop that shit, man. You\\'re here all by yourself? That\\'s right. Just me. - Where Ripley\\'s safe at, keeps his valuables in? - I don\\'t have any idea. I fuckin\\' bet you don\\'t. We gonna take a look upstairs in the man\\'s bedroom, all right? You and Mr. Buddy look at all the rooms down here. Check the paintings, behind the walls. Check the fuckin\\' walls in the closets. The man\\'s got a safe. It\\'s here somewhere. What about his place down in Florida? If you called, we could have checked the walls down there before we left. That is, if you\\'d bothered to find out where he was. You follow me? Man, take this bitch upstairs. Upstairs! Listen, you try and trip any alarms, anything like that, you gonna be a dead Hazel, you understand me? - Hey, hey, where we at? Where is it? - Over there. - Ever wear one of these? - I don\\'t ski. Keep an eye on the maid. I\\'ll have a look around. Go sit down. Please. Damn, Mo. How\\'s this motherfucker livin\\', man? Shit! Check behind the pictures on the walls, man. Hey, Mo. Found some rubbers. White Boy, why the fuck you lookin\\' under the mattress? You know dude ain\\'t gonna hide no diamonds under there. Damn! Dumb \\'bama motherfucker. - Where Foley at, man? - He\\'s checkin\\' the other rooms like you said, boss. Man, keep a eye on Foley. Ken, stop fuckin\\' with the radio, put on a CD. - I don\\'t recognize none of these bands, Mo. - Just pick somebody. What, \"How To Sing Like Michael Bolton\"? What the fuck you wanna listen to, huh? - I like Schubert. - Schubert? Well, I don\\'t. Uh, Foley? Cool. 911 got you on hold, Richard? - Foley! - How you doin\\'? What in God\\'s name is happening here? - Who\\'s upstairs? - Snoopy Miller, couple of his friends. - Maurice, from Lompoc? - Yup. Have they got Midge up there? What kind of a man lets a woman answer the door this time of night? We thought it was her husband. He comes here and checks up on her. I\\'m supposed to be down in Florida. In a few minutes, you\\'re gonna wish you were. Let\\'s go, come on. Why don\\'t you sit down? We\\'ll have a look at your fish. Oh, that\\'s workin\\'. That\\'s workin\\'. Motherfucker! I found the safe, yo! Don\\'t go nowhere. - Oh, shit! We gonna have a party! - Look at that bitch. They found the safe. - Fuck. - Buddy, you remember Richard, don\\'t you? - Yeah, hi. Nice house. - Thank you. Yeah, man. We just all hit this handle, blow this sucker wide open, man. Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let\\'s get ready. Oh, Dude... you\\'re gonna kill me with that. - Where you been, man? - Found some steaks. - Steaks? - Yeah, some big ones, bro. Man, come on. Blast this damn safe open, man. - He\\'s down there lookin\\' for food. - Fool. All right. Hold it. No. Get to the side, man. All right. On three. One, two, three. - Jesus Christ, they\\'re shooting Midge! - Sit down, Dick. They\\'re trying to open up the safe, not your maid. Oh, shit. Man, we didn\\'t even crack this sum\\' bitch. - Okay, hit the hinges. - Uh-huh. Put your finger in your ear, man. This is gonna be loud. All right, on three. One, two... The combination is 3-10-44. - Richard\\'s birthday. - Thank you. Are they dead? We gotta find Foley, man. Can\\'t believe you\\'re still angry with me after all this time. I\\'m not angry with you, Richard. In fact, I\\'m completely relaxed. The thing is, I can\\'t figure if it\\'s the fish that are cooling me out, or all those uncut diamonds in the bottom of the tank, there. Goddamn. Dumb-fuck Glenn was right.

You can have a nice time with him on the ride down, picking up where your interlude or whatever you call it left off, and then you can throw him in the shithouse. He knew what he was doing. Nobody forced him to rob banks. My little girl... the tough babe. I\\'ll call you later. Good-bye. Jack. I got you a present. Something for the road. I\\'m gonna have to take it away, though, soon as the ride is over. Jack Foley? Meet Hijirah Henry. What kind of a name is Hijirah? - It\\'s Islamic. - What\\'s it stand for?

You were in Leavenworth, huh? - Four time. - Meaning? - Meaning, time came, I left. - You busted out. I prefer to think of it as an exodus from an undesirable place. - How long before they caught up with you? - That time? - There were others? - Yeah. That was the ninth. The ninth? Well, ten if you count that prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from. - You done a lot of walkin\\', Henry. - Hijirah. Hijirah. Now we\\'re off to Glades. Yeah, it looks that way. I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait. - She did, huh? - Guess it\\'s cheaper taking two of us down in one van. Could be.

Man, I gotta tell you, I never would\\'ve believed it, but you turned out to be one hell of a DJ, man. What you in the mood for, Petey? Why don\\'t you play me some of that old Sly Stone? If You Want Me To Stay. (PHONE HANGS UP) Hung up. It\\'s all right. (FUNK MUSIC PLAYING) What\\'s your job, man? What\\'s your job, man? I\\'m sorry, man. Screen the calls! Shut up! Screen the calls! God. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) One minute. How much is it? Priceless, but the pizza\\'s on me. I ran into the delivery guy in the hall. Nice! So I hear you\\'re the man up in here now. Cathy Show was a hit. I bought the station. Congratulations. Is that enough milk? Oh, that\\'s fine, honey. To your success. Aren\\'t you gonna ask me how he is? How is he? Come on, Dewey. He helped you build this place. You can say his name. How\\'s Petey? Well, you know, all those years of hard living\\'ll catch up to you one day. His time is tight. He misses you. (CHATTERING) You see this show? My whole fucking life is this show. I learned to walk, talk and dress watching The Tonight Show. I can tell. (BOTH LAUGHING) It showed me that there was a world far away from the Anacostia projects. He reminds me of my brothers. Loud-ass shit-talkers. Funny as hell. Always had me cracking up. Milo was the funniest. He was my hero. He could say anything, do anything. He could\\'ve been a... Well, he\\'s at Morgan\\'s every Tuesday night, waiting for somebody to give him a good game. Thanks for the drink. I love you, Dewey. You take care of yourself, okay? (R&B MUSIC PLAYING) Tails. So you the new Blue Blazes, huh, man? That\\'s right. You sure did it, Dewey. Took that little old two-bit radio station and turned it into a powerhouse, man. I couldn\\'t have done it without you. No. I could\\'ve never did that shit you did. Like you said, Dew, I needed you to do all the things that I was too afraid to do. What about the other part? What other part? The part when I said that I need you to say all the things that I\\'m afraid to say. Oh, that part. (COUGHING HOARSELY) Not now. Well, the truth is, you ain\\'t getting no younger, man. So I decided I\\'m gonna cut you some slack. Go on and forgive you. Forgive me. I love you like a brother, man. I know you love me, too. Now, you too stubborn to say it, but I think you miss old Petey Greene. So I\\'m gonna give you one last shot. That\\'s deep. (CHUCKLES) Yeah it was, wasn\\'t it? I might put that in a card someday. (PETEY CHUCKLES) (POOL BALLS STRIKING) Good shot, Petey. (CHATTERING) Everybody come back to the shop with their eyes fucked up... Stop it! (INAUDIBLE) PETEY : I ain\\'t nothing, man, I ain\\'t nothing but a con and a thief. So I ain\\'t up here trying to be nobody\\'s preacher. I\\'m just trying to tell the truth to y\\'all, like I promised I would. DEWEY : Petey liked to say that he was just a con. Telling it like it is. But he was more than that. He said the things that we were afraid to say. I\\'m sorry, man. He was the bravest man that I ever met. He was, and still is, everything I\\'m not. And that\\'s why I love him. MAN: Yeah. So, in the words of my best friend, \"That\\'s all we got. MAN: Yeah! \"There ain\\'t no more. That\\'s right! \"Time is tight. \"It\\'s the end of the show. \"So grab your head and make a fist. \" \"Listen to me and remember this. \" ...and remember this.

INTRODUCTION  1 The applicants (whom I shall call the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants) have applied under s 5 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) (the ADJR Act) for an order setting aside a decision of the first respondent the Native Title Registrar (the Registrar) by his delegate given on 3 May 2006.2 The Registrar\\'s decision concerned an application for a determination of native title under s 61 of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the NT Act) (matter NTD 21 of 2005) brought by Thomas Petherick, May Stevens and Captain Wodidj over an area of land in the Town of Batchelor.I shall call them the Town of Batchelor No 2 applicants.That application was instituted on 29 August 2005 and amended on 26 March 2006.I shall call that application the Town of Batchelor No 2 application.As amended, the Town of Batchelor No 2 applicants claim to have brought the application on the authority of the Emu and Blue Lizard Kungarakany group (the Town of Batchelor No 2 native title claim group).3 The Registrar\\'s decision which is attacked by the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants, was that the Town of Batchelor No 2 application be accepted for registration pursuant to s 190A of the NT Act.4 The effect of registration of an application for the determination of native title includes that the applicants obtain the benefit of the right to negotiate processes under sub-division P of Pt 2 of Div 3 of the NT Act.Governments are required to give registered native title claimants (as defined in s 253) notice under s 29 of the NT Act of any relevant future acts that may affect the claimed area.The Town of Batchelor No 2 applicants are each a native title party for the purpose of such negotiations, so registration of the Town of Batchelor No 2 claim gave them the right to object to such future acts.There are other benefits of registration, prior to the determination of whether the claimed native title rights and interests exist in the claim area, but at present it is not necessary to refer to them.5 The Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants are also applicants in a separate application for the same land in the Town of Batchelor.Their application was brought on 21 September 2001.As that claim was first in time, I shall call it the Town of Batchelor No 1 application.By decision of the Registrar of 26 October 2001 the Town of Batchelor No 1 application was accepted for registration pursuant to s 190A of the NT Act.The applicants in that application brought the application on behalf of the Warai and Kungarakany groups.Since registration of their claim, they too have possessed the procedural rights which derive from registration, including the rights to be notified, and to object and to negotiate, in respect of future acts.Future acts, it is argued, include proposed acts involving proposed acquisition of the claim area under the Lands Acquisition Act 1978 (NT).6 The Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants claim to be aggrieved by reason of the decision of the Registrar, because in essence there are now two groups of people with the same negotiation rights in respect of the same claim area by reason of the registration of both the Town of Batchelor No 1 application and the Town of Batchelor No 2 application.Whether that is sufficient for them to qualify as persons aggrieved by the decision of the Registrar to accept for registration the Town of Batchelor No 2 application is a matter I shall address below.BACKGROUND  7 However, I note that the issue is not merely a theoretical one.Two notices of proposal under s 43 of the Lands Acquisition Act to compulsorily acquire such native title rights and interests as exist in relation to parts of the Town of Batchelor have been issued by the relevant minister, the Minister for Lands, Planning and Environment of the Northern Territory.The first was given on 8 May 2001, and the second on 22 June 2001 in respect of various allotments within the Town of Batchelor.The Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants objected to those proposals pursuant to their procedural rights under the Lands Acquisition Act, but those objections were not received because they were made out of time.The Minister then on 24 June 2002 signed the notice of acquisition and purported to acquire the native title rights and interests in respect of those pieces of land.8 Consequently, the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants brought proceedings in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory on 5 July 2002 in relation to the Minister\\'s refusal to extend time within which to have lodged their objections, and asserting that the purported acquisition notices were invalid and beyond power: Hazelbane v Minister for Lands (Matters 100, 101, 102 and 103 of 2002 in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory).Following the institution of those proceedings, the Minister gave an undertaking to the Supreme Court not to proceed to grant interests in or to deal with or transfer the land the subject of those notices without giving notice to the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants.Those proceedings were then adjourned to a date to be fixed pending resolution of issues raised in related proceedings in which the same issue occurred.9 That same issue occurred in relation to proposals to acquire native title rights and interests, or certain of them, in the Town of Timber Creek.On 31 July 2003, a judge of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory decided that such notices were invalid as being beyond power in the circumstances: Griffiths v Lands and Mining Tribunal and Minister for Lands Planning and the Environment (2003) 179 FLR 241.That decision was reversed by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory: Minister for Lands, Planning &amp; Environment (2004) 14 NTLR 188.The High Court subsequently granted leave to appeal from that decision.On 15 November 2007, judgment on the appeal was reserved.It addresses questions as to whether s 43 of the Lands Acquisition Act permits the compulsory acquisition of native title rights and interests in land for the purpose of extinguishing native title in order to alienate land for the private benefit of another citizen; whether s 24MD of the NT Act permits the acquisition of native title rights and interests in land for the purpose of vesting the affected land in the Northern Territory freed and discharged of the native title rights and interests; and whether s 46 of the Lands Acquisition Act is repugnant to s 238 of the NT Act.10 In the meantime, an application for the determination of native title in respect of the Timber Creek township area has been heard and determined: Griffiths v Northern Territory of Australia [2006] FCA 903 on 17 July 2006.That decision was upheld by the Full Court: Griffiths v Northern Territory of Australia [2007] FCAFC 178 delivered on 22 November 2007.11 In respect of the Town of Batchelor No 1 application, following a notice of intention of 1 July 2002, 11 persons apparently representing the same interests as the Town of Batchelor No 2 applicants in the Town of Batchelor No 2 application, were joined as respondents to the Town of Batchelor No 1 application (without prejudice to the right of any party to apply for an order that any such person cease to be a party to the proceeding).They described themselves as becoming respondents to the Town of Batchelor No 1 application on behalf of eight clans known as the Finniss River Brinkin Group, namely the Long-neck Turtle, Red Catfish, Marri, Kangaroo, Werak, Goanna/Pulima, King Brown Snake, Emu and Blue Tongue Lizard clans.One of those persons was Michael Anglitchi.When the Town of Batchelor No 2 application was first instituted, he was one of the named applicants on behalf of the King Brown Snake clan, but following its amendment he was removed as an applicant and the King Brown Snake clan was removed as a clan or group on whose behalf that claim was brought.THE REGISTRAR\\'S PROCESSES  12 The Registrar, in deciding to accept the Town of Batchelor No 2 application for registration pursuant to s 190A of the NT Act, did not notify the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants or their solicitors of the Town of Batchelor No 2 application, and did not seek submissions from them on whether that application should be accepted for registration.Nor did the Registrar notify the Northern Land Council (NLC), which is the responsible native title representative body for the area, of that application or seek submissions from it on whether that application should be accepted for registration.The NLC had, pursuant to s 203BE of the NT Act, certified the Town of Batchelor No 1 application as the representative body for the area in which that claim was made.It thereby confirmed that it held the opinion that all the persons in that native title clan group had authorised the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants to make that application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it, and that all reasonable efforts had been made to ensure that that application described or otherwise identified all the other persons in the native title claim group: see s 203BE(2).The Northern Land Council did not certify the Town of Batchelor No 2 application.CONSIDERATION  Standing  13 The Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants must satisfy the Court that they are persons aggrieved by the decision of the Registrar, before they have the standing to challenge the validity of his decision under the ADJR Act.14 They contend that their interests are adversely affected by the Registrar\\'s decision, so that success in this application for review will result in a benefit to them, or relieve them of a detriment, to an extent greater than ordinary members of the public: see Onus v Alcoa of Australia Ltd [1981] HCA 50 ; (1981) 149 CLR 27 at 75-76; Right to Life Association (NSW) Inc. v Secretary, Department of Human Services and Health (1995) 56 FCR 50 at 60-65.That must be because the procedural rights which they obtain by registration of the Town of Batchelor No 1 application, as discussed above (see Fejo v Northern Territory (1998) 196 CLR 96 at 121-125; Strickland v Native Title Registrar [1999] FCA 1530 ; (1999) 168 ALR 242 at 244-246), or the enjoyment of those rights and the extent to which they can be exercised, are restricted by the decision of the Registrar which gives the Town of Batchelor No 2 applicants equivalent procedural rights.15 In Western Australia v Native Title Registrar [1999] FCA 1591 ; (1999) 95 FCR 93 , Carr J decided that the State of Western Australia was a \"person aggrieved\" for the purposes of making an application for review under s 5 of the ADJR Act in respect of a decision of the Registrar to admit for registration a particular native title claim.His Honour found that the adverse effect of registration upon the State so qualified it, because as owner of the land the subject of that particular native title claim, the State was restricted in its capacity to deal with its proprietary interest, and was obliged to submit to the statutory requirements of negotiation in respect of future acts under the NT Act.Obviously, the impact upon an owner of land of an application for the determination of native title being admitted for registration under s 190A of the NT Act is different from the impact upon a person or persons in the position of the Batchelor No 1 applicants.They are competing native title claimants whose claim has been registered, and not land owners.16 One of the reasons Carr J reached that conclusion in Western Australia v Native Title Registrar [1999] FCA 1591 ; 95 FCR 93 was that the government, being primarily responsible for the development and manner of use of the land the subject of that particular native title claim, had a \"very close relationship with the subject matter\" of the registration decision, and that the NT Act recognised that closeness by, for example, the requirement in s 66(2) of the Act not only that the State be notified of the application for registration, but also that it be supplied with all affidavits and documents in support of it: see at [20].17 A similar obligation is imposed upon the Registrar under s 66(2A) of the NT Act in relation to the relevant representative body of the area covered by the application, in this case the NLC.18 I was referred by counsel for the Batchelor No 1 applicants to s 66(3)(a)(i) of the NT Act.Under that provision, the Registrar is obliged to give notice containing details of an application for determination of native title to any registered native title claimant in relation to any of the area covered by the application which is being assessed for registration under s 190A.I do not think that that provision operates to provide or enhance the status of the Batchelor No 1 applicants in this matter as persons aggrieved by the decision of the Registrar.That is because s 66(3) commences by saying that it is generally subject to the section.The Registrar\\'s obligation is specifically then explained or qualified, at least in terms of the time when it must be implemented, by s 66(6)(a).Pursuant to s 66(6)(a), in the event of a claimant application, the Registrar must not comply with sub-section (3) until the Registrar has decided, in accordance with s 190A, whether or not to accept for registration the claim made in the application.In my view the position is clear.Not only is the Registrar not required by s 66(3)(a)(i) to have given notice of the Batchelor No 2 application to the Batchelor No 1 applicants, as registered native title claimants in respect of the same claim area, until the Registrar has decided whether or not to accept the Batchelor No 2 application for registration, but he is positively directed not to do so by s 66(6)(a).19 Consequently, if the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants are to establish that they are persons aggrieved by the decision of the Registrar, they must do so by some circumstance un-unsupported by, and perhaps even informed by, s 66(6)(a).20 In my view, the procedural rights which they obtained by registration of the Town of Batchelor No 1 application are not, in terms, diminished by the fact of the acceptance for registration of the Town of Batchelor No 2 application.Their procedural rights under the Act remain the same.But, at a practical level, it is said that the enjoyment of those procedural rights is diminished because the persons with whom they have rights of negotiation would also have to deal with the Town of Batchelor No 2 applicants who would possess equivalent rights of negotiation.The outcomes of negotiations in relation to a future act or future acts which might be the subject of such negotiation would, it is argued, in a practical sense have to be shared or may have to be shared between the two sets of registered applicants.In my view, as a matter of commonsense, that is likely to be correct.In such negotiations, the person or entity who is the potential beneficiary of the future act is unlikely to negotiate in a way which would give each of the negotiating registered native title applicants the same benefits as if there were only one group of registered native title applicants with whom those negotiations should be conducted.To put it somewhat crudely, the potential fruits of the negotiations would probably be shared rather than doubled.21 Upon that basis, in my view, the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants have demonstrated that their interests are adversely affected by the decision of the Registrar to accept for registration the Town of Batchelor No 2 application.The potential benefits or advantages which they enjoyed before that decision, by reason of the Town of Batchelor No 1 application having been accepted for registration, would be diminished so they would have suffered a disadvantage or detriment to an extent greater than the ordinary members of the public: Onus v Alcoa of Australia Ltd at 75.In Strickland and Nudding (on behalf of the Maduwongga People) v Native Title Registrar [1999] FCA 1089 , at [23] French J remarked upon the extent to which overlapping native title claims had impacted upon the imposition of those claims, and upon the administration of the right to negotiate the process.I think his Honour\\'s remarks are consistent with the conclusion to which I have come.22 For those reasons, in my view, the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants have standing to challenge the decision of the Registrar.Procedural Fairness  23 The first basis upon which the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants challenge the validity of the Registrar\\'s decision is that, in the circumstances, the Registrar was obliged to extend procedural fairness to them, and that he did not do so.24 They assert, and I accept, that had they been notified and accorded the opportunity to provide a submission regarding the question of whether the town of Batchelor No 2 application should have been accepted for registration pursuant to s 190A of the NT Act.They either directly or through the NLC would have provided anthropological and other material to the Registrar\\'s delegate which (they assert) may have influenced the decision of the Registrar through his delegate to conclude that the town of Batchelor No 2 application should not have been registered, and indeed legally could not be registered.They have identified to a degree the nature of that material in the evidence on this application.At present, I do not need to go into it.25 Certain principles are clear.When a statute confers a power on a public officer, the exercise of which may affect a third person\\'s rights or interests, that person is entitled to procedural fairness until that entitlement is excluded by express terms or by any necessary implication: Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 ; Minister for Agricultural Affairs; ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57.The way in which procedural fairness should be provided in any particular circumstance depends upon the nature of the decision of the statutory framework in which it is made: SZBEL v Minister for Immigration [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 81 ALJR 515.In this matter, if the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants were entitled to procedural fairness (as they claim), the opportunity to make written submissions and to present material to the Registrar would have been an appropriate step for the Registrar to have taken.They seek no more than that.26  In my view s 66 of the NT Act, for the reasons I have given above, proceeds on the basis that a decision to accept for registration a native title claim under s 190 not only may, but must, be made before competing registered native title claimants in respect of the same claim area are notified of the competing claim.In Griffith University v Tang (2005) 31 CLR 99 Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ at 117-118 referred to there generally being a relationship between the questions of standing and, in the context of procedural fairness, the right to be heard.However, in my view s 66(6)(a) makes it plain that in the normal course a competing registered native title claimant is not entitled to be given the opportunity to be heard when the Registrar is considering whether to accept for registration a native title determination application over the same area of land.The mere fact of having standing to challenge the Registrar\\'s decision does not mean that the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants were entitled to the opportunity to make submissions to the Registrar and to present material to him when he was considering such a decision.27 However, there are particular features in the present matter which take the position further.The Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants were in fact aware of the Town of Batchelor No 2 application, and that the Registrar would in due course consider whether to accept it for registration.The NLC, as the relevant representative body for the area covered by both applications, was entitled to be given a copy of the Town of Batchelor No 2 application and other documents relating to it pursuant to s 66(2A) of the Act.That may be how the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants came to learn of the later application.The NLC had certified the Town of Batchelor No 1 application.The solicitors acting for the NLC were the same solicitors as were acting for the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants.Those solicitors had indicated a desire to make a submission to the Registrar on whether the Town of Batchelor No 2 application should be accepted for registration.There was then an e-mail exchange between the Registrar by his officers and those solicitors on 1 December 2005 in which it was acknowledged that such a submission was to be made, and that such a submission would be made after the proposed amendment to the Town of Batchelor No 2 application.The officer of the Registrar indicated that the time within which the submission should be made and material presented would be notified to the NLC once the amendments had been effected.I accept that, on the evidence, the proposed submission in opposition to the potential registration of the Town of Batchelor No 2 claim was delayed until after the proposed amendment of that claim and that the Registrar gave notification that the Registrar was considering whether to accept for registration the amended Town of Batchelor No 2 application.I also accept, as I have said above, that had such a submission been made it would have raised significant material for the Registrar\\'s consideration relevant to whether the Town of Batchelor No 2 application should have been accepted for registration.28 It is that combination of particular circumstances which, in my view, gave rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants and an obligation on the part of the Registrar that he would give the NLC and its solicitors notification that he was considering whether to accept for registration the Town of Batchelor No 2 application and a time within which to take the opportunity to make submissions and to provide information in relation to it.I am mindful of the fact that relevant communications on 1 December 2005 were between the solicitor for the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants and for the NLC on the one hand, and an officer of the Registrar, but referred only to a submission from the NLC.In my view, there was such a coincidence of interest between the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants and the NLC in the present circumstances, a coincidence which was apparent to the Registrar from the Town of Batchelor No 1 application having been certified by the NLC, that the opportunity to make a submission and to present additional information was one which was an entitlement to procedural fairness which covered both the NLC and the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants.29 It is accepted that that opportunity was not provided by the Registrar.30 In my judgment, therefore, there was a failure to accord procedural fairness to the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants in the particular circumstances before the decision was made by the Registrar to accept the Town of Batchelor No 2 application for registration.The nature of the submission, and additional information, which may have been provided in response to such an opportunity might have affected the outcome of the Registrar\\'s decision.31 I accordingly propose to set aside the Registrar\\'s decision on that ground.32  I will briefly refer to the other two grounds upon which the Registrar\\'s decision is attacked.Use of Information  33 The Registrar was satisfied of the existence of a sufficient factual basis to assert the native title rights and interests claimed in the Town of Batchelor No 2 application, as required by s 190B(5).34 He reached that view in large part upon material prepared by the FRBG for the purposes of mediation in the Court in relation to the town of Batchelor No 1 claim.It was provided to the Registrar, apparently at the behest of the Town of Batchelor No 2 applicants.35 The Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants contend that the Registrar erred in having regard to that information, as its use was prohibited by s 53A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), and alternatively because they were not given an opportunity to address it.The alternative contention is already dealt with in addressing whether the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants were entitled to, and were accorded, procedural fairness.36 Section 53A provides:  Evidence of anything said, or of any admission made, at a conference conducted by a mediator in the course of mediating anything referred under section 53A is not admissible:  (a) in any court (whether exercising federal jurisdiction or not); or    (b) in any proceedings before a person authorised by a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, or by the consent of the parties, to hear evidence.   37 The Town of Batchelor No 2 applicants are entitled to provide additional material to the Registrar, in addition to that in the native title determination itself, to support the Registrar\\'s satisfaction of the requirements of s 190B(5): see Martin v Native Title Registrar [2001] FCA 16.38 Section 53A does not prevent a party producing in evidence the same material as that presented at a mediation, provided of course it is relevant.That is really self-evident.If it were not so, no party could (for example) at a mediation refer to a statement of a proposed witness without the risk that that witness statement could not be adduced at a later hearing.Of course, the fact that that witness statement was referred to at the mediation could not be adduced at evidence at the hearing.Nor, generally, would it be relevant.What was improperly before the Registrar (if any error was made) was the fact that what he called \"the FRBG Submissions\" were presented at the mediation.But subject to their relevance, the FRBG Submissions could have been (and were) presented to the Registrar as material relevant to his satisfaction under s 190B(5).And the Registrar simply recorded that he understood that material \"to have been prepared for the purposes of mediation\" in the Court.He did not receive material as to what was said at the mediation, or of anything there said.Had he actually received material that the FRBG Submissions were presented at the mediation, then s 53A may have been infringed.But there was no apparent reliance by the Registrar upon the fact of their presentation to the mediation, so it would have been an error without consequence.The material apparently is of a factual and conclusory nature, and was equally eligible to be presented to the Registrar as to a mediator.39 It is not necessary to consider, therefore, whether the role of the Registrar in considering whether to accept for registration the Town of Batchelor No 2 application is a proceeding attracted by the scope of s 53A(b) of the Federal Court of Australia Act .Authorisation  40 The third principal contention of counsel for the Batchelor No 1 applicants is that the Registrar fell into error by identifying the wrong issue and asking himself the wrong question in addressing the procedural requirements in s 190C(2) and (4).If that were made out, it would amount to reviewable error on the part of the Registrar: Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179.41 Section 190C(2) requires the Registrar to be satisfied that the application contains all the details and other information, and is accompanied by any affidavit or other document, required by ss 61 and 62.That requires the Registrar to consider whether the requirements of ss 61 and 62 are met in the amended Town of Batchelor No 2 application.For the reasons I expressed in Northern Territory of Australia v Doepel [2003] FCA 1384 ; (2003) 133 FCR 112 at [32] - [37] , I do not think the Registrar was required to go beyond the application in considering if that requirement was satisfied, and in particular was not required to undertake some form of merit assessment of the material.42 The Registrar has worked through each of the requirements or elements of s 61 and s 62 of the Act, and assessed the application, that is the Town of Batchelor No 2 application, by reference to each of those requirements.That involved a careful consideration of the Town of Batchelor No 2 application and of the affidavits which accompanied it, as required by s 62(1)(a).He concluded that the application contained all the details and other information, and was accompanied by the documents, required by ss 61 and 62.I have gone through the documents to which he referred, in the light of submissions by counsel for the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants.In my view, the Registrar\\'s conclusion was reasonably available to him.I do not think he is shown to have misunderstood the law or to have asked himself the wrong question in addressing the requirements of s 190C(2).43 The gravamen of the contention on behalf of the Town of Batchelor No 1 applicants was more focused upon the requirements of s 190C(4)(b).It provides that the Registrar must be satisfied that the Town of Batchelor No 2 applicants are members of the native title claim group and are authorised to make the application, and to deal with matters arising in relation to it, by all the persons in the native title claim group.The alternative provided by s 190C(4)(a) was not available because the NLC as the relevant representative body had not certified the Town of Batchelor No 2 application under Pt 11 of the NT Act.The requirements of s 190C(4)(b) are then further explained by s 190C(5) which is in the following terms:  If the application has not been certified as mentioned in paragraph (4)(a), the Registrar cannot be satisfied that the condition in sub-section (4) has been satisfied unless the application:    (a) includes a statement to the effect that the requirements set out in paragraph (4)(b) has been met; and       (b) briefly sets out the grounds on which the Registrar should consider that it has been met. 44 The Registrar noted the definition of authorisation in s 251B of the NT Act.He correctly identified that he was required to be satisfied of the matters set out in s 190C(4)(b).He also identified the nature of that task as described in Doepel at [78].As he said, the NT Act places fundamental importance upon ensuring that claimant applications are properly authorised: see e.g.Quall v Risk [2001] FCA 378.The Registrar said that the necessary statements for s 190C(5)(a) are made in the s 62 affidavits.There are affidavits pursuant to s 62 of the NT Act of May Stevens, Thomas Edward Petherick and Captain Wodidj adopting or using the words of s 62 of the NT Act, and therefore apparently providing a foundation for the Registrar\\'s satisfaction that the requirement of s 190D(5)(a) of the NT Act had been met.He then said that he was satisfied that there was material at Schedule R and in Attachments R1, R2 and R3 to the Town of Batchelor No 2 application which met the requirements of s 190C(5)(b) as that material briefly set out the grounds on which he should consider that the requirements of s 190C(4)(b) had been met.45 The Registrar then turned from what he apparently considered to be the more formal requirements of s 190C(5) to the more substantive requirements in fact of s 190C(4)(b).He noted that the application had been made in the first instance without legal assistance, and so he did not expect \"the level of organisational or legal sophistication in the documenting of the process\" of authorisation which might otherwise have been expected.He said he had made some allowances for the form in which the relevant information had been provided, and regarded the information provided as both true and as evidence of satisfactory authorisation.He noted that the Town of Batchelor No 2 applicants do not state whether the process by which they have been authorised to make the claim is traditional as contemplated by s 251B(a) or is an agreed and adopted one as permitted by s 251B(b).He regarded the material as demonstrating an authorisation process that had taken place under s 251B(b).He concluded that the material as a whole demonstrated that the Town of Batchelor No 2 claim group was aware of the necessity to appoint applicants to lodge and maintain their claim, and that that process required both formality and solemnity.He said that the process of consultation with members of that claim group was wide, and ongoing for some time.He referred again to the affidavits filed pursuant to s 62.Upon the whole of that material, he was satisfied that the Town of Batchelor No 2 applicants are members of the native title claim group and are authorised to have made the application, and to deal with matters in relation to it, by all the other persons in that native title claim group.46 The Town of Batchelor No 2 application identifies that Thomas Edward Petherick and Captain Wodidj are members of the Emu Clan, and that May Stevens is a member of the Blue Tongue Lizard Clan.It says that they have been authorised by the Emu and Blue Tongue Lizard Clans to make the application.Schedule A to the application describes the composition of the native title claim group described as the Emu and Blue Tongue Lizard Clans, and specifically describes it as separate from the claim group in the Town of Batchelor No 1 application.47 Attachment R1 to the application is apparently a letter from Ray Petherick and Margaret On sent on 29 March 2005 to the clan members of the FRBG.It sets out certain aspects of the process by which the point has been reached that the clan members may wish to pursue an application for the determination of native title, and if so would have to nominate one or two spokespersons and to agree to participate in the claim.It foreshadowed then a period of consultation.Attachments 2 and 3 are authorisations to make the claim on behalf of the Emu Clan and the Blue Tongue Lizard Clan respectively.Under the heading \"Authorised Persons\" both Attachment 2 for the Emu Clan and Attachment R3 for the Blue Tongue Lizard Clan each record that \"Mr Thomas Edward Petherick, Mr Raymond John Petherick, and Claude Narjic to be spokesperson interpreter in the courts representing for the FRBG\".Attachment R2 then records the clan group representative spokesperson to be Captain Wodidj, who has signed that document, and refers to the authorisation having been given at a meeting on 6 July 2005.Attachment R3 is in identical terms save that the Blue Tongue Lizard Clan group representative spokesperson is May Stevens, and she has signed the document on behalf of the Blue Tongue Lizard Clan group.It refers to an authorisation meeting of 23 August 2005.Each of Attachments R2 and R3 also records the Edward Ray Petherick as researcher is authorised to compile information to \"forward to the courts and to mediate\" with elders and legal advisors on behalf of the clan groups.Attachment R4 is a statement apparently of Thomas Frederick Petherick explaining and describing the extensive consultation process he undertook in 21 field visits in relation to the proposed application between 2004 and 2005.It refers then, after a series of consultations, to seven claims having been lodged for the determination of native title apparently under s 61 of the Act.48 As the Town of Batchelor No 2 claim group is said in the application to be identified by descent from ancestors, by spiritual, religious and physical connection with the claim area, and from occupation and resource use connection, and comprises those persons descended from seven named ancestors, the authorisation must come from that claim group.The Town of Batchelor No 1 applications contend that the material available to the Registrar could not satisfy him that the Town of Batchelor No 2 applicants are members of that native title claim group and are authorised to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it by all the other members in the native title claim group.They submit that the material available to the Registrar did not reveal the basis for, and use of, any traditional decision-making process, although (they contended) the authorisation was said in the application to be a traditional one so as to attract s 251B(a) of the NTA because it referred to persons listed as elders who gave permission to bring the claim.Secondly, they contend that the material in any event does not identify those persons who do have traditional authority to make such decisions and the basis for them having such decision-making authority.They then contend that, if the process of authorisation is not a traditional one (as the Registrar found it was not) the material does not expose that all members of the native title claim group, that is the persons descended from the seven named apical ancestors, have agreed to and adopted a relevant decision-making process.Finally, they contend that the material does not expose any authorisation from the native title claim group to the Town of Batchelor No 2 applicants, but purports to have \"elders\" authorising \"the Woolaning Community family members to act on behalf of\" the FRBG.The reference to \"the Woolaning Community family members acting on behalf of the FRBG\" comes from Attachments R2 and R3.Each commences by saying the named elders \"gives permission in the presence of legal representative ... to give authorisation to the Woolaning Community family members to act on behalf of \"the FRBG to make an official Native Title Claim\" for the determination of native title.It then has separate headings for \"Authorised Persons\" and \"Clan Group Representative Spokesperson\".The summary of the contention is that the Registrar, therefore, has fallen into error in identifying a wrong issue and asking himself a wrong question in addressing the requirements of s 190D(4)(b) and s 190D(5) of the NT Act.49 I understand the Registrar\\'s preparedness to overlook shortcomings in the Attachments to the Town of Batchelor No 2 application because they were not professionally prepared.I agree that it was appropriate to look at the substance of those documents.However, the substance of those materials, on a proper reading, must be adequate to satisfy the Registrar of the requirements of s 190C(4)(b).50  In my mind, the material presented did not have that quality.I accept it is sufficient to support a conclusion that each of the Town of Batchelor No 2 applicants is a member of one or other of the clans comprising the claim group.It is also sufficient to satisfy the Registrar that Captain Wodidj and May Stevens are \"Clan group representative\" spokespersons for the Blue Tongue Lizard Clan and the Emu Clan respectively.But neither of those documents, having regard to their contents and to the documents accompanying them, is in my view sufficient to satisfy the Registrar that each of the Town of Batchelor No 2 applicants is authorised to make the application by the other persons in the claim group.In my view, it is simply not clear as to whether those three persons, or the two clan group representative spokespersons, or Edward Ray Petherick, or Thomas Edward Petherick, or a combination of those persons are the persons authorised to make the application and deal with matters arising in relation to it by the members of the Town of Batchelor No 2 claim group.The affidavits of each of the Town of Batchelor No 2 claimants which simply take in, in a direct quote, the terms of s 62(d) are not, in the circumstances sufficient to overcome that inadequacy in the material.51 Had that requirement been capable of being satisfied, I think the Registrar\\'s analysis of the material to be satisfied that the claim group had authorised the bringing of a claim under s 251B(b) was available.It indicated a very extensive and prolonged process of consultation on an informal basis, culminating in the two meetings referred to in Attachments R2 and R3.His analysis is not, in my view, inconsistent with the Town of Batchelor No 2 application because I do not consider that its description of the claim group does not necessarily point to an authorisation in accordance with traditional laws and customs under s 251B(a).52 However, the difficulty remains that the material could not satisfy the Registrar that the three Town of Batchelor No 2 applicants are the persons authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it.For that reason also, I consider the decision of the registrar to accept the Town of Batchelor No 2 application for registration under s 190A of the NT Act should be set aside.ORDERS  53 The decision of the Registrar of 3 May 2006 that the Town of Batchelor No 2 application be accepted for registration under s 190A of the NT Act be set aside.I will give the Town of Batchelor No 2 applicants leave to apply in the event that they wish the Town of Batchelor No 2 application be referred back to the Registrar to reconsider whether to accept it for registration.I certify that the preceding fifty-three

      " 'Newcrest Mining Limited v Apache Northwest Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1663 (7 November 2008)http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2008/1663.htmlreferred toNewcrest Mining Limited v Apache Northwest Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1527http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2008/1527.html1 On 17 October 2008 I ordered that Apache Northwest Pty Ltd (\"Apache\") give preliminary discovery of certain classes of documents to Newcrest Mining Limited (\"Newcrest\"): see Newcrest Mining Limited v Apache Northwest Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1527. A verified list of documents was to be filed and served on or before 30 October 2008.2 Apache applied for leave to appeal from this decision. On 30 October 2008 Middleton J varied my order by extending, until 14 November 2008, the period within which Apache was required to file and serve its verified list of documents.3 When I made the order for preliminary discovery I foreshadowed that it might be necessary, at a later time, for the matter to return to Court to deal with consequential issues such as confidentiality. Apache subsequently advised the Court that it considered that it would be necessary for a confidentiality regime to be put in place to deal with commercially sensitive documents. An issue also arose as to which party should bear the costs of preliminary discovery.followedCappuccio v Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1999] FCA 1188http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/1999/1188.html6 The conventional approach to costs orders in this area was explained by Burchett J in Cappuccio v Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1999] FCA 1188 at [3] - [4] where his Honour said that: \"3. ... I have a discretion as to just what I should do in respect of costs, and it seems to me that the costs order which would be appropriate in a case like this depends very much on the consequences of the discovery obtained. If the applicant for preliminary discovery uncovers enough to enable that applicant to bring proceedings which are successful, there may be much to be said for the proposition that the costs of the preliminary discovery should form part of the costs of the action. On the other hand, if the applicant proceeds, brings an action, fails, and is ordered to pay the costs of that action, there seems to be every reason why, generally speaking, the costs of the preliminary discovery should be included in the costs payable to the respondent. 4. There may, of course, be cases where there are special reasons to vary the normal rule that costs follow the event. In this particular case, having listened to the arguments of both sides, each of whom seeks a costs order, I have come to the conclusion that the appropriate order, in the event that a case is brought for substantive relief, is that the costs of this application be at the discretion of the tribunal which hears the substantive application. In all the circumstances, I order that, if a substantive application is brought by the applicants against the respondent bank within six weeks of today\\'s date, the costs be dealt with in the way I have indicated.\"distinguishedC7 Pty Ltd v Foxtel Management Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1864http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/FCA/2001/1864.html7 A different approach was taken by Gyles J in C7 Pty Ltd v Foxtel Management Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1864. C7 had sought preliminary discovery of documents. The application was opposed but C7 was largely successful. His Honour expressed the view (at [50]) that an application pursuant to Order 15A of the Federal Court Rules was a discrete application and that he should deal with the costs issue. In reaching this decision his Honour was influenced by the fact that, despite the fact that C7 had been successful, the relief which it obtained was offered prior to the hearing. He was also concerned that the respondent would be out of pocket, awaiting \"some indefinite future event\" because it was required to undertake the expense of providing the preliminary discovery.8 In my opinion, in the circumstances of the present case, it is appropriate to make a conventional order. Apache opposed the making of any order relating to preliminary discovery. Moreover, orders of the conventional kind will not expose Apache to an indefinite delay in recovering its costs, at least no more delay than would attend recovery of the costs of discovery in an ordinary proceeding. Apache\\'s interests will be protected by an order that Newcrest pay its costs in the event that no proceeding is commenced in this Court within six weeks of Newcrest undertaking inspection of the discovered documents. Even if Newcrest commences a proceeding in a Court other than this Court Apache will be entitled to recover its costs of providing discovery once the six week period has elapsed.

      " \"              Notebooks   Today, I went to Staples to buy post-it notes and turn in a print job for work. While I was there, as is my custom, I browsed through the notebooks and pens to see if there is anything that I need (want).   Here's the thing about me.  I love notebooks.  I like plain Mead notebooks, and if theres something really special about a notebook then I am very excited.  I like the idea that all those blank pages belong to you (assuming you buy them).  Its exciting to think about all the things that could be written in them.  Sometimes its only lists of things that need to be payed, but sometimes its deep thought and revelation.   I feel similarly about pens.  A pen that writes well is a god-send.  I hate to write with pens that skip or have weak ink.  I love a .05, black, roller pen that has a soft grippy thing and bold ink.  There's something about pens and paper that makes me feel boundless, eager and creative.  Like how a ball must feel as it teeters on the edge of a cliff, all of its potential energy surging through it.  One small tap and all of that potential can be realized.  I feel that way about notebooks and pens.          \"\n",

      " 'Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to distill the knowledge of a cumbersome\\nteacher model into a lightweight student model. Its success is generally\\nattributed to the privileged information on similarities among categories\\nprovided by the teacher model, and in this sense, only strong teacher models\\nare deployed to teach weaker students in practice. In this work, we challenge\\nthis common belief by following experimental observations: 1) beyond the\\nacknowledgment that the teacher can improve the student, the student can also\\nenhance the teacher significantly by reversing the KD procedure; 2) a\\npoorly-trained teacher with much lower accuracy than the student can still\\nimprove the latter significantly. To explain these observations, we provide a\\ntheoretical analysis of the relationships between KD and label smoothing\\nregularization. We prove that 1) KD is a type of learned label smoothing\\nregularization and 2) label smoothing regularization provides a virtual teacher\\nmodel for KD. From these results, we argue that the success of KD is not fully\\ndue to the similarity information between categories from teachers, but also to\\nthe regularization of soft targets, which is equally or even more important.\\n  Based on these analyses, we further propose a novel Teacher-free Knowledge\\nDistillation (Tf-KD) framework, where a student model learns from itself or\\nmanuallydesigned regularization distribution. The Tf-KD achieves comparable\\nperformance with normal KD from a superior teacher, which is well applied when\\na stronger teacher model is unavailable. Meanwhile, Tf-KD is generic and can be\\ndirectly deployed for training deep neural networks. Without any extra\\ncomputation cost, Tf-KD achieves up to 0.65\\\\% improvement on ImageNet over\\nwell-established baseline models, which is superior to label smoothing\\nregularization.'\n",

We\\'ll get a pizza, and we\\'ll make a night of it. Um... actually, my nights are kind of busy right now. Yeah. Homework and all, huh? Yeah. Yeah. We were the hottest Catholic high school team in New York City, on our way to the championship. We felt like nothing could stop us. Yeah! Yeah! Yes! We\\'re on our way. We\\'re on our way. Let\\'s go. Let\\'s go. Hands up. Show me some defense. Show me some defense. Good steal. Put it in. Put it in. Yeah! All right. All right. Way to go. Aw, geez. All right, Neutron. Yes! Yes! To the hole, Jim. What\\'s going on? Break it up! Come on. Hit him! Beat that motherfucker! He fucking held me! This dude blows the whistle... Slow it down! Slow it down! You got to have presence on the court... presence like a cheetah rather than a chimp. They both got it, but chimpy got to jump his nuts around all day to get it. Shy cheetah just moves in total nonchalance a sec or two in his sexy, slow strut. Me, I play like a cheetah. Let\\'s go, Rangers- let\\'s go! Let\\'s go, Rangers, let\\'s go! Yeah! Ooh! You got it! It\\'s ours. It\\'s ours. Yeah! 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1! Yay, Jim! Oh, shit. That\\'s my team! That\\'s my team! There\\'s only two things Swifty forbids... using the word \"motherfucker\" and stealing from the other team, as long as they\\'re white. How much for that group of winners over there? It\\'s $34.90. $34.90? Changed the prices or something? No. I\\'m a little short. Do me a favor. Here. Take my watch, and I\\'ll come back later with the rest of the money. No. What do you mean, no? I\\'m sorry, sir. Those burgers are worth more than the watch is. I\\'ll be right back. I told you one burger each, didn\\'t I? It takes at least eight of these to get filled up. Yeah. C\\'mon, Swifty. We\\'re growing boys. Growing boys? We\\'re hungry motherfuckers. Funny, huh? I\\'m not driving you guys home. How\\'s that for laughs? You ripped them off, didn\\'t you? We\\'re even now. Swifty, come on. How are we going to get home? Face the music, pricks. What are we going to do? They got the door blocked off. You afraid of these pussies? I ain\\'t afraid of anybody. What\\'s the problem? I\\'m going to ask you this once. All right? Where\\'s the stuff you stole from me? What are you talking about? No, no, no. You\\'re not going to fuck with me, all right? Now, somebody stole my father\\'s ring from my locker, motherfucker. You want me to cut you? Is that what you want, there? There\\'s no problem here. Hey, guys! Let\\'s get out of here, c\\'mon! You need a fucking army, huh? Come on! Come on! Oh. Nice. That from Bobo? That\\'s his father\\'s ring. Hey, fellas. Any of you looking for a date? Yeah. Me, sweetheart. Little horsy ride in Central Park, maybe candlelight dinner? Why don\\'t we skip right to dessert, huh, baby? About $15? Fifteen bucks? I\\'ll give you a quarter. Let Pedro suck your tits. You don\\'t have to be rude. Oh, I\\'m sorry. How about you, handsome, huh? You got $15... for a little head? Diane, do I look like I need to pay for it? Yeah... you do. If it\\'s worth it. Jimmy... Jimmy, I know you want some, honey. $15. I\\'ll do you so good you\\'ll never forget it, baby. Hey, hey! Ooh! That\\'s a deal. Bargain from there. What do you say, guys? You want to do it? All four of us? - Yeah. - It\\'s a deal. All four of us. Aw, shit. This is all I got, Diane. Here, have a pretzel. - Get out of here. - Beat it. Yeah, fuck you! Fucking dopehead. You see what that shit does to you? Wow. Speaking of dopeheads, is that Pedro\\'s mother over there slinging her wares again? It is! Hey, Peepee, where you going? Why do you have to be such an asshole all the time, huh? Why is the little shoe crying anyway? His mother\\'s a sneaker. His father\\'s a loafer. Somebody\\'s got to be a heel. Jim, where you going? Hey, Jim! Jim. Hey. Hey, man. What\\'s up? You don\\'t recognize me with my new hairdo? It\\'s nice. It\\'s nice. I like it. What\\'s going on? - How are you? - Good. Wow. Look at that. You like it? Yeah, I\\'ll tell you what. When you get out of here, we\\'ll all shave our heads and look like a gang of skinheads. It\\'s a deal. All right. I got something for you here. Yeah. Everyone on the team. Look right here... even Swifty signed it. Thanks, man. You remember when I dunked on that spade in Riverside Park? You always had good ups. Yeah. Oh. I got something to show you. Hold on. What? Pedro got these out of some lady\\'s purse. - She\\'s doing it with a donkey. - Oh, Jesus! Look at that schlong. Look at that one. Oh, I beat your record. How many times you choke it? Seven times. Bullshit. Seven times. My mom thinks I have a cold year-round because of all the tissues around the house. You can keep those if you want. They\\'re pumping so much junk in me, I can\\'t even get a decent chubby. I got an idea. Come on. Let\\'s go. Where we going? I\\'m getting you out of this place, man. C\\'mon! What are you, crazy, man? I can\\'t go anywhere. Here you go. I\\'ve known Bobby since I was 3. He\\'s my best friend. He was the best player on our basketball team. Two years ago, he got leukemia. He keeps fighting it off. I know Bobby\\'s going to beat it. He could beat anything. Watch! Jim, you\\'re going to kill me, man. If you let go, I swear... I swear I\\'ll kill you, man. Watch the bump! What the hell happened to forty deuce? Last time I was here, that theater was playing Sperminator II. Oh, yeah. I remember that. No, man. This whole block has been done over by all these new artists. It\\'s pretty cool, huh? Yeah. They should put your stuff up there. Yeah. Right. Still scribbling stuff in that notebook of yours, ain\\'t you? Of course. You bring anything for me? What, like to read? No, like to eat. What do you think? Yeah. I mean, I got this, but it\\'s not a big deal. I don\\'t even remember writing it, to tell you the truth. Yeah, Yeah. I\\'ll be the judge of this. \"Little kids shoot marbles \"where branches break the sun \"into graceful shafts of light. I just want to be pure. All right. # What a life # Nothing like the real thing to float your boat, huh, Bobby? # What a life # # Didn\\'t know where, didn\\'t know when... # That\\'s nice. # Said that I\\'ll go... go learn # # Put up my hand, wait my turn # # But it never comes, I have to shout out # # That\\'s life # # And that\\'s what it\\'s all about # # So through the comfort and the strife # # What a life... # Get me out of here, Jim. What are you talking about, man? This was a stupid idea. I don\\'t feel so good. Well, can we wait till the end of the show? Did you hear what I said? I said get me the hell out of here! Hey, Bob, man... I\\'m really sorry, you know? Next time, we\\'ll go somewhere... Ain\\'t gonna be no next time, Jim. I love it this way... my feet against the tar, which is soft from the spring heat, the slight breeze that runs across your entire body, especially your crotch. You feel an incredible power being naked under a dome of stars while a giant city is dressed, dodging cars all around you five flights down. I don\\'t think of anything while I\\'m doing the actual tugging, least of all the heavy sex fantasies I have to resort to indoors. Just my own naked self and the stars breathing down, and it\\'s beautiful. Time sure flies when you\\'re young and jerking off. \"Camp summer position. Driver... taxi. \" Hey, that might be good. You could get your license this summer. Oh, yeah, Mom. That sounds really great. Hey, get your own job, and if you don\\'t get it this summer, you\\'re coming to work with me at the hotel. Mom, please. Why are you so worried about this? Do I even ask you for money? No. I\\'m not worried about the money. I want you to have responsibility. I don\\'t want you running around the streets of New York. Idle time is the devil\\'s plaything, Jim. The devil\\'s plaything, huh? That might be a cool title for my first book. Thanks! What are you talking about? What are you writing? Here. Ooh. Um... Ma, I\\'m not really that hungry this morning, alright? - Come on. You got to eat something. - I know... Where you going? I\\'m going to shoot some hoops. Sometimes I feel like something\\'s chasing me, like there\\'s some whacko on a roof somewhere who could snuff me out at any moment. And I feel this horrible fear. Will I have time to finish- the poems breaking loose in my head? Hey, white boy, you ready for your beating? Don\\'t let your mouth get you into something your ass can\\'t handle. I\\'ll shoot you for it. So it\\'s going to be like that, huh? I... don\\'t think so. Yeah! All right, so you made one. Big deal. You made one shot. Make another. # The days are muzzled in a vibe # # I swing back from time to time # # There\\'s a Camaro, rusty red # # That all my best friends drive in # # Can you smell the summer air? # # Take me where they left the light on # # Getting close, almost there # # If that fuzzy silver badge # # Don\\'t greet us there # # My head\\'s dizzy, and I\\'m taking... ## Yo, Jim! What\\'s the score? Come on. We got to go. They don\\'t keep score in this game. Jim, come on. We\\'re losing the sun. He\\'s being a dick. You want me to put a charge in his ass? Whatch this. Oh, look it, right here... Jim\\'s secret diary he\\'s always writing in. Bet you he wrote some shit about me. Oh, right here. \"Spring... Mickey. \" Hey, there I am, Jim says. \"Mickey takes out a bottle of carbonic cleaning fluid and suggests we do a little sniffing to get high. \" Whoo! \"After four deep whiffs, we\\'re sailing someplace else. \" Mickey, what are you doing? \"Bells ringing through my ears, little lights flashing through my eyes. \" Mickey, put that down, all right? \"I pictured myself \"paddling across a river with black water, \"only the canoe was going backwards instead of forwards, \"with clouds that had faces. Laughing, spooky, fun-house laughs... \" - Give it back, alright? - What is that shit? Why do you have to be such a schmuck, Mickey? What are you talking about? Don\\'t you ever touch that again. It\\'s private. What\\'s your problem? I\\'m... I\\'m sorry. He\\'s writing about me, I can\\'t read about it? Jesus! Hey, Jim, come on. We\\'re gone. Yo, we got a cab! Hey, cabby! Hey, swami! So, Shakespeare, you going to finish the game? C\\'mon, Reggie, you know this game never ends. See you later, all right? Every crowd has its little games to prove if you\\'re a punk or not. My cousin in Jersey plays chickie, which is two cars heading towards each other at about 80 miles per hour. First driver to swerve out of the way is, of course, chicken. In Brooklyn, they make you press a lit cigarette into your arm and have it burn all the way down to the filter without the slightest flinch. Us, Manhattan boys, we jump off cliffs into the Harlem River, which is literally shitty, because half a million toilets flush into it every day. Whoo-oo! Yeah! Oooh! Yeah! Hey, y\\'all, I carried the clothes up, but I ain\\'t carrying them down. Peepee, this is you... all 33 pounds of you, gone with the wind. Wow. That\\'s a long way down. Devil\\'s toe is no big deal. We\\'ve all done it a million times. I never done it. You never did it? Pedro, you never do nothing. You know who was awesome on this rock? Bobby. That kids would do back flips off this rock. Hey, Mickey. What? Don\\'t talk about him like he\\'s dead. He\\'s not dead. There goes the circle line. Check it out. Whoo! Full moon! Whoo! Hey, yo! Whoo! Hey, circle this! Hey, I\\'m going. Watch out, watch out... I\\'m going to show you how to do it. Ye-ea-ah! That was a good jump. Oh, he\\'s nuts. Hey, I\\'m going to walk down. What you talking about? You can\\'t walk down. There\\'s no way to walk down. I ain\\'t jumping. Pedro, your clothes are down there. How you gonna get your clothes? You going to walk around naked all day? Pedro, if you don\\'t jump, Mickey\\'s going to tease you so bad- You might as well just jump and get it over with. Feel better. What the hell, right? shit... Pedro! Bad form. Bad form. Oh... My God! Oh, shit. Is he all right? Pedro, you all right? You ready? Yeah. Listen, don\\'t tell the other guys, but when we leave here, I got a surprise for you. Tell me what it is. It\\'s a surprise. Trust me, all right? Ouch, don\\'t mess around, man... Alright, you ready? Come on! You ready? - Let\\'s jump. - On three. Ready? 1, 2, 3. Come on. Let\\'s go. What\\'s up, Manny? How you doing? Fine. Thank you, sir. This is my friend Jim. How you doing? I can\\'t believe I hit my head on that rock. It\\'s killing me. Jim, um, this is Winkie. - Hi. - How you doing? Good. And this... this is Blinkie. - Hi. - Hi. # I lost my heart # # Under the bridge # # That little girl... # I\\'ve seen you play ball, Jim. You\\'re a very beautiful player. Very zen. # And now I moan # # And now I holler # # She\\'ll never know # # Just what I found # # That blue-eyed girl # It\\'ll make you fuck like Superman. # She said no more # Faster than a speeding bullet... # Became blue-eyed whore... # More powerful than a locomotive... # Down by the water # # Down by the water... # Able to, um... I can\\'t think of anything with a single bound. # See her again # # See her again... # Do you have any protection? Yeah. This one\\'s, uh, ribbed for extra pleasure. So what are you waiting for? What do you mean? Take off your clothes. Well... could we shut off the lights first? # Little fish, big fish # # Swimming in the water # # Come back here, man # # Give me my daughter # # Little fish, big fish # # Swimming in the water ## White ship disappears in the wave machine this morning. Your eyes got shut with secret chains that pillow armies eventually set free... like soft horses through toy deserts. I love this mansion, though it\\'s too many windows... to open halfway each morning... to close halfway each night. I looked at his body, and it was death for the first time. His face was thin and wrinkled, almost apelike. His hair, just gray patches on his scalp. He looked 60 years old, and he was 16. Couldn\\'t believe how skinny he was... much skinnier than he was in the hospital. It was like having the skeleton of someone you knew put right in front of you. I felt dazed, like I\\'d just come out of a four-hour movie I didn\\'t understand. I kept thinking about his face... and death... what a cheat the whole thing was. Hey, you guys remember that Halloween when Bobby filled that paper bag with dog shit, lit it on fire and put it outside Father Dunne\\'s door, and we all hid behind the dumpster? Yeah. I could picture Father Dunne comming outside, stepping on that shit. Picture him in the john- scraping the shit off his shoe like this. You think that\\'ll keep him out of heaven? Are you kidding? Jesus Christ himself would have laughed at that. It was hilarious! What about the time at the formal when Bobby got caught in the bathroom with Mary Ann Dugan and McNulty came in and busted him? He was, like, \"Father, I swear. We weren\\'t doing anything. \" Meanwhile she\\'s got a giant wad of cum hanging off her face. I tell you, that kid was definitely a pisser. It was weird seeing him today, man. He was all shriveled up and wrinkled. He looked like my grandfather. I\\'ll tell you what, though. That kid was in so much pain, it\\'s better off he died. How the hell would you know, Mickey? Did you go and visit him? Any of you guys go and visit him? All right. Then shut the fuck up. Hey, Jim. Look at my brother\\'s girlfriend in the park. She\\'s sitting there, eating a sandwich. Next thing you know, she\\'s shot in the head. She\\'s dead. It\\'s over. What about little Teddy Rayhill? Perfect example. Remember that night he was up on the roof, and he was doing poppers, having a great time, laughing his ass off He started walking backwards... Boom! He fell right off the goddamn roof. It was meant to be, right? Fuck that, you guys! Bobby was the best fucking guy around, you know that? What are you, a bunch of idiots? You don\\'t even understand, do you? Jim, you all right? Listen, maybe you should talk to one of the priests. I don\\'t know. Maybe... Maybe they can help you out. Help me out? I wouldn\\'t ask one of those cocksuckers for directions. You know what? You guys need to lighten the fuck up, all right? Let bygones be fucking bygones. Shitty fucking world. Live life to the fucking fullest. You know what I mean? Shit happens, man. Shit fucking happens. Come on. Let\\'s go. Jim, come on. You\\'re growing up, and rain sort of remains on the branches of a tree that will someday rule the earth. And that\\'s good that there\\'s rain. Clears the month of your sorry rainbow expressions. And it clears the streets of the silent armies so we can dance. # Ted sniffing glue He was 12 years old # # Fell from the roof on east 2-9 # # Cathy was 11 when she pulled the plug # # 26 reds and a bottle of wine # # Bobby had leukemia, 14 years old # # He looked like 65 when he died # # He was a friend of mine # # Those are people who died, died # # Those are people who died, died # # Those are people who died, died # # Those are people who died, died # # They were all my friends # # They just died # # Those are people who died, died # # Those are people who died, died # # Those are people who died, died # # Those are people who died, died # # They were all my friends and they died ## Did I ever tell you about the first time I did heroin? I went down to Pedro\\'s basement. All sorts of characters were in the storage-room shooting gallery. I was just going to sniff a bag, but a guy says, \"If you\\'re going to sniff, might as well pop it, and if you\\'re going to pop it, might as well mainline. \" I was scared of needles, but I gave in. It was like a long heat wave through my body. Any ache or pain or sadness or guilty feeling was completely flushed out. Look, Ma, I\\'m not in the mood for your dime-store psychology, all right? Could you just please leave me alone? I got a little sick, all right? We\\'re not going to live like this, Jim. We\\'re not going to live like this. I\\'m warning you! I\\'m telling you. Oh, God, Mom. You\\'re always warning me, aren\\'t you? Blah, blah, blah. You\\'re always in my fucking ear. Blah, blah, blah. You don\\'t know anything. What are you talking about? Go clean toilets or whatever the hell it is you do. When you\\'re done, clean this one. Don\\'t talk like that! What\\'s the matter with you? Gee whiz, Ma, you know... we got to have these heart-to-heart talks more often. They\\'re really good for us. I don\\'t know you. I don\\'t believe this is you, Jim. Please, Jim. I don\\'t know who you are. Yeah, I know. I was such a good little boy, right... with such potential, wasn\\'t that it? Is that what you\\'re going to say? Oh, Jim. What\\'s happening? Jim, what\\'s happening? First, it\\'s a Saturday-night thing, and you feel cool, like a gangster or a rock star. It\\'s just something to kill the boredom, you know? They call it a chippie, a small habit. It feels so good, you start doing it on Tuesdays, then Thursdays. Then it\\'s got you. Every wise-ass punk on the block says it won\\'t happen to them, but it does. Go do it! I ain\\'t doing it. I always do it! I\\'ll do it. I\\'ll do it. Excuse me, ma\\'am. Could you tell me the fastest way to the subway? Yeah. That\\'s the \"B\" train. Go to this corner and make a left. It\\'s right there. What are you doing? Let go! Let go! Let go of that! Oh, my God! What? - Help! No! No! - What are you doing? Let\\'s go! Come on! I don\\'t feel like going in today. Father, is it all right if I don\\'t go in today? Why? What are you scared of? Nothing. I just don\\'t feel like it, that\\'s all. I imagine you have more to confess than anybody here. Unburden yourself. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It\\'s been about four months since my last confession. Yes, my son? Well, I don\\'t know where to start, Father. Have you taken the name of Jesus Christ in vain? Yeah. Yeah, I have. Have you disrespected your mother and father? Have you stolen or cheated your fellow man? Yeah, but I\\'m not proud of it. Have you had impure thoughts or engaged in impure deeds? Oh, Father, you have no idea. Is there something else that you want to tell me in your own words? I\\'ve done all kinds of crazy shit. Oh, excuse me, Father. Fuck, I\\'m s... Christ, I have a dirty mouth. Look, I\\'m... I\\'m sorry about that. Will you just go on? 10 Hail Marys, five Our Fathers. What do you mean? And that\\'s it? That\\'s my punishment? You know something? My friend Bobby, he was the best, and he\\'s dead. This sucks! You know that? This really sucks. It\\'s not fair, Father. Your nose is running, your stomach cramps, your legs feel like they\\'ve played six straight games on top of each other, and the voice is always there in the back of your head... \"Just one more time. then we\\'ll stop. \" Quick to the ball. Quick to the ball. Two hands. Good, Ignatius. Good. Good. Quick to the ball. Two hands. Right behind you. Sir, all right if I use the bathroom, Coach? Jim, you got a bladder like a woman. Let\\'s go. Again. There we go. Right behind him. Right behind him. Quick to the ball. Two hands. Two hands. Jim? I thought you were taking a piss. What are you doing in here every practice? Have you been waiting for me, Jim? Giving me some kind of a signal? What are you talking about, Swifty? Don\\'t act surprised. Do we understand each other? It\\'s not going to happen, Swifty. Put the money away. You want more? Here. Just let me do it. Get the fuck out of my face! Take it easy, Jim. You can\\'t blame me for trying. I made a mistake, all right? Let\\'s just pretend it never happened. Things will go back to exactly how they were before. Okay? Okay? Here, keep the money. Keep the money. Just don\\'t tell anybody, all right? Good. Tell anybody you want! Nobody\\'s going to believe a drughead like you, anyway. You think we don\\'t know what you\\'ve been doing? Give me the fucking money and get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck- Get the fuck out here! Come on! Get out of here! And you want to stop. You really do. But it\\'s like a dream. You can\\'t stop dreams. They move in crazy pieces, any way they want to, and suddenly, you\\'re capable of anything. No! Wake up, Mr. Carroll! It\\'s later than you think. Oh. All right! - I need a lift. - All right. What do you got? Three different pills. Which are the ups? I never asked. I thought one of youse would know. Oh, great. We look like pharmacists? I don\\'t know what to take. What do we take? Let me see. The blacks and the reds are the ups. I think the pink ones are the ups. Why? \\'Cuz I associate pink with lightness, you know? The black ones seem like they\\'d knock you on your ass. They might be faded seconals. No, they\\'re not faded. They\\'d be sticky. They\\'re not. That\\'s bullshit. - Fuck your mother. - My what? All right! Calm down. Don\\'t ever talk about my mother. Don\\'t ever hit me like that again. Come on! Alright! Give me your hat. We got a game to play, alright? Just give me something. Hi, Neutron. Let me ask him. Neutron, you know which ones are the ups? I think you should put that shit away before Swifty comes in here. Why you acting like such a square ass? Screw you, Mickey. Screw you, too, Tough guy. Man. I\\'m just going to take the black. You sure? You got a better idea? Nope. Your guess is as good as mine, Jimbo. It\\'s on today. 50 rebounds. Good. Come on. Let\\'s go. I\\'m your friend now, right? What, I got to smack you again, c\\'mon! Yeah, take your little rat with you. - What\\'s up, man? - Hey, what\\'s up? Why are you acting like that? You know what\\'s wrong. Used to be about getting high and playing basketball. Now it\\'s just about getting high with you. You\\'re blowing it, Jim. Oh, come on. I don\\'t need to hear this from you, Neutron. Yeah, you do, Jim! Listen, no, Jim! I\\'m really proud of you, man. Everything\\'s cool. You look great. I\\'ll see you in the NBA. # Riders on the storm # # Riders on the storm # # Into this house we\\'re born # # Into this world we\\'re thrown # # Like a dog without a bone # # In fact we\\'re all alone # # Riders on the storm # # There\\'s a killer on the road # # His brain is squirming like a toad # # Take a long holiday # # Let your children play # # If you give this man a ride # # Sweet family will die # # Killer on the road # # Yeah ## Did you find it? No, Father. It\\'s clean. There\\'s no drugs in there. Thank you, Officer. I told you we didn\\'t have nothing. You boys think you\\'re awfully smart, don\\'t you? Well, you\\'re both suspended for a week! Ooh... And you\\'ll never play basketball here again. That you can count on. You can\\'t kick me off the team, Swifty. Oh? Why is that? \\'Cause I quit the team... and the school and this whole faggot-ass scene, that\\'s why. I could second that motion. Your resignations are accepted! Neutron, you coming with us? Yeah. That\\'s what I figured. Come on, man. I\\'m fucking out of here. Don\\'t worry, Swifty. I\\'m not going to rat you out. And in the next life, Father, I\\'m going to have the paddle! Get out! Thanks a lot, Neutron. Thanks, man. I can\\'t believe this, you know? I know. What happened to the pills? We got kicked out of the school, Mickey. Who cares, man? We lost the pills. The cops took them- We can\\'t play ball anymore. Jim, who cares about school, man? We just lost $40 worth of pharmaceuticals. I know what happened to them, too. The cops, they take that all the time. They either pop them themselves or they sell them. What\\'s my mom going to say, man? When I go home? She ain\\'t gonna say nothing. You just tell her you\\'re going to school every day in the morning. Let\\'s get out of here, man... Go get into something. You never sold any pills at the schoolyard? No. So it\\'s all a big conspiracy against you. Right, Jim? Yeah. Maybe it is. Maybe it\\'s not. You been missing these? What are you going to tell me... they\\'re vitamins? Oh, fuck you, Ma. What?! Get out of my house! Oh, is that what you want, Ma? Get out! You don\\'t talk to me that way! If that\\'s what you want, I\\'m fucking out of here. All right? What are you doing? I\\'m leaving! What do you think? I wan you to take all your shit! I\\'ll help you. Here! You want me to leave? Yes. Get out! I\\'m out of here. Get the fuck out of my way! This garbage is going to kill you, Jim! I\\'m gone! Gonna to kill you! Don\\'t you understand? I can\\'t watch you kill yourself? Ma, you\\'re never going to fucking see me again, alright? Just remember that. Don\\'t say that, Jim. Don\\'t say that! It was a dream, not a nightmare... a beautiful dream I could never imagine in a thousand nods. I saw this girl next to me who wasn\\'t beautiful until she smiled, and I felt that smile come at me and heat waves following, soaking through my body and out my fingertips in shafts of color. And I knew somewhere in the world... somewhere... that there was love for me. We just got to raise enough cash to keep our heads straight. Luckily, finding money in New York is like getting laid at the prom... easy. - Fuck it, Pedro! - What\\'s the matter with you? Jesus! Watch the road. You could kill us all, c\\'mon! I get 1,500 bucks for this car. If it\\'s whacked up, it\\'s worth nothing. We should buy shit in bulk, man We\\'ll put it on the street and make real money. That\\'s 500 bucks a piece. We\\'ll be on for days, nights, weeks. Yeah, man. I\\'d love to go to Puerto Rico, soak up some rays, you know? See my bitch? That\\'s what I\\'d like to do. - What are you talking about? - What bitch? We haven\\'t seen a picture or nothing. She\\'s 500 pounds, Jim. She got a mustache thicker than her father. No. That\\'s your mother, Mickey. She does not exist. Don\\'t fool yourself. Be careful. I\\'m about to whack. Oh, shit, man. My brother\\'s going to take care of us and this car. Pedro, wake the fuck up! Pedro, come on, man! You\\'re going to get us killed, what are you doing? I got it, man. You want me to drive? Mickey, you better drive the car. I\\'m serious, man. Just don\\'t blow my high. If there\\'s a scratch in the car, my brother\\'ll kill me. Yo, get out of the booth! Get out the booth, huh? Get out. Fucking... What\\'s up? What\\'s up? Come on, I\\'m in a hurry. Where\\'s the car? It\\'s good to see you, too. It\\'s over here. It\\'s nice. It\\'s smokin\\'. You tell me that? It\\'s everything you wanted. Get your hands off. You guys look like shit. Oh, my God. They\\'re taking the car. Show me the sign, man! Show me the freaking sign! It\\'s right there. You see? It says \"tow-away.\" You scumbags even read? I should kick all your punk asses! Goddamn it! I can get you another car tonight. Yeah? John Halligan is waiting for this car. I got him out of bed with his wife. You know how this makes me fucking look? Kenny, get off. You\\'re too stupid to be my brother! You\\'re too stupid! You want a piece of me, Carroll? Back off! Back off! - Kenny, no more! - Mr. Tough Guy. - Kenny, no more! - Huh? Tough guy? Give me a sip of your soda. You wipe off the bottle before you take a sip? You don\\'t even think twice about sharing works with Mickey. You think you\\'ll catch something from the bottle you\\'re not catch from a needle? You mistake me for somebody who gives a shit. Headquarters... home on and off to every down-and-out junkie and wino from 14th Street to the Bowery. It\\'s like a fucking all-star team. Jimmy, the other day, my mother\\'s been ragging on me, \"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. \"You\\'ve tried every other way. Go to church. Put yourself in Christ\\'s hands. \" So I do it, man. I figure, give it a shot. I dig Jesus. So, I go, man. High mass... a choir and everything. The first thing I see on the right, the side altar, are those little candles in the red glass that we used when it was windy in the park to cook up. And then, this altar boy, he\\'s coming down the aisle with this 6-foot candle. I envision this huge spoon above it, man, with, like, shopping bags full of dope inside of it. And then the kicker comes, man. The priest, he starts doing the thing with the incense. You know, starts wafting out. I\\'m in the back. It finally hits me. \"Where do I know this smell from, man? My room, man. \" It\\'s the smell exactly of really primo dope cooking up. Yeah? Exactly the same. So what happened next? At that point, I split. I went home, I went inside my closet, I got my stash out of the inside pocket of my sharkskin easter suit, and I got stoned. Ba bing... ba bang. I love a ritual. Oh, Mary, if you can hear me... I need you to fill Jim\\'s heart with love because he really needs it now. Oh, God... please watch over my son. He needs you now. Just take care of him, okay? I\\'ll be okay. I love you, Jim. I love you. Hey, you holding? You straight, man? Get out of here. Come on. No. Hey, have you seen Falco? Come on, man. Are you holding anything? Hey, Diane... Come here, Diane. - I\\'ll take care of you, babe. - Yeah? Yeah. How about some of this? I wouldn\\'t do you for a bag, you fucking piece of shit. Jim. Jimmy. You\\'re looking good. Who\\'s your embalmer? I want some of what you got. Check everything in this place. Wow. I always wanted to use these syrup pumps. And these professional ice-cream scoopers. Oh, my God. Don\\'t make me do it! I\\'ll do it! I swear to God! Jim, watch out. Come on! It\\'s not opening. They don\\'t make them like this anymore. You got to get it from the side. I got it! Oh, cool. Change! Shit! Let\\'s get out of here. It\\'s locked. We got to go out the back. Pedro, let\\'s get out of here! What am I, hallucinating here? Pedro, you\\'ll get us caught. The cops are going to come. Oh, you want to be tough, huh? Go ahead... take another sip so I can blow your fucking head all over the counter! Go ahead, Pedro! Go ahead! Come on, guys! Let\\'s go. Put that gun away! Don\\'t fuck with me, motherfucker! What the hell are you doing, Mickey? What the hell did you do that for? Let that little spic rot, man! He\\'ll get us caught. Jim, the cops are coming. Come on! Jim! Jim! Pedro! Pedro! Jim! Freeze! Freeze! On your stomach! On your stomach! I didn\\'t do anything, I\\'m telling you! This is it, man. That Jew got to keep the money under his pillow. Hey, Jim, I know you\\'re still mad about Pedro. I couldn\\'t do nothing, man. He was going to get us caught. Definitely shouldn\\'t have went that far. What happened to you? Your mother kick your ass? Yeah, real funny. Bring us a couple of Cokes, will you? You all right? Hey, bartender, move out of the way. Jim, I\\'m getting sick. I got to get some money to cop. Jim. You with me here? What the hell are you wa... Oh, shit. That\\'s Neutron. That\\'s the all-American high school game? We could have played in that game. Who gives a shit? Come on. I\\'m waiting to hear back on a scholarship from Saint John\\'s... I\\'m not sure about it, but hopefully it will work out. Jim, I\\'m starting to jones. Gotta get out there. We need some money. Jim, don\\'t dwell on these dreams, man. Will you come on? Meet you outside, man. I\\'m getting sick. You want to meet me out there? Is it okay if I say hi to my mom? Hi, Mom. - Thanks. - Thanks a lot. # You don\\'t know it, but you\\'re coming right along # # Please be strong # # You don\\'t know it, but you\\'re coming right along ## Hey, you! Stop! You can\\'t go in there! Stop! What do you want? You realize what time it is? Yeah. Um... is Winkie and Blinkie here? Who the hell are Winkie and Blinkie? Hey, guys. Lisa, Mel, you know this boy? No, Daddy. Come on. All right. Come on. Get out of here. - I\\'m sorry, Mr. Rubin. He got past me. - Don\\'t let it happen again. It won\\'t happen again. Get out of here! What? What? Asshole. Hey, fuck-up, get fucking up, man! - What\\'s your problem, man? - What\\'s YOUR problem, mam? You sold my girlfriend some shit the other day. You almost killed her. What was it... rat poison? It\\'s not my fault your girl can\\'t handle her drugs. I want my fucking $20 back, man. Look, there\\'s no money-back guarantees. I\\'m not selling refrigerators here. Oh, yeah? I\\'ll cut you a dynamite deal on mexican shit. Give me my $20, or we\\'ll go outside. If we go outside, one of us is going to get hurt. I told you one of us would get hurt. Is that right? It\\'s been hard... the writing... lately. Terrible numbness, then suddenly it comes... in beautiful fragments or terrible dreams... like nods... so high. Reggie, is that you? Who the fuck do you think it is? Don\\'t worry, you\\'re not dead yet. It\\'s not bad. Hey, give me that. How come it\\'s all wet? Because you pissed on it. I didn\\'t say you could read this. What, have you been digging through all my stuff? I need... I got to get out of here. Where\\'s my jacket? You\\'re welcome. What the hell am I thanking you for? Because you was frozen in the snow like a goddamn creamsicle. Where is it? What? You know what the fuck I\\'m talking about, Reggie! Where is it? You mean this? Give it to me. I\\'ll cut your fucking throat, Reggie! Give it to me, all right? Just give it to me! Oh, give it to me! Give it to me! I\\'m serious! Give me it! Give it to me! Goddamn it! I\\'ll make you an incredible offer. I\\'m going to save your life twice in one day, understand me? You should have left me in the fucking snow, man. Give me the money for my dope, too. I\\'m not gonna suck your dick, all right? Put that away. Who the hell wants you to suck their dick? Goddamn it! Look at yourself! Just look at yourself. Oh, Reggie... it\\'s okay. Why are you doing this? Because once upon a time, somebody helped me, and I always pay what I owe. Reggie. Reggie, I just need a taste. I just need a little something, Reggie. You don\\'t understand. It hurts, Reggie! Reggie, I got to go. I got to go see my mom. You got to let me get out of here, Reggie. Reggie! It hur... It hurts. Shit! Oh, boy... # Touch the taste and taste the smell # # Smell the scent, all the gifts you gave to me, baby # # The food of your brain # # The room is spinning round # # I never come down # # The room is spinning round # # I never come down... # Reggie. you got to give me it. You got to give me it, Reggie. Please! Reggie, come on! # I remember you, too # # I blew my mind ## Wake up. Can\\'t sleep all day. Oh. Thanks. Jesus Christ. What happened to you? What does it look like? Motherfucker shot me. Woke my black ass up. Shit. Look, uh... I\\'ll be back in the morning, Jim. You just stay cool. You start to get panicky, write about me in that book of yours. Actually, I was a little hurt I wasn\\'t mentioned. You really like my writing, huh, Reggie? Damn, man, I told you four times already. What do you want me to do? Bend over and kiss your ass? Hey, Reg, do me a favor. While you\\'re out, pick me up a bag. # The room is spinning round # # I may never come down # I am alone. Not just me. We\\'re alone... alone forever. And who\\'s at the end of that forever tunnel I run through, up Fifth with the wallpaper of skyscrapers? I\\'m thinking, after all those beautiful trips, that this is one of those bad ones. Diane? Hey! Jim. Remember me? Man, you look great. Yeah, thanks. Good to see somebody from the old neighborhood... What do you want, Jim? - You holding anything? - No. Just like a 5 or something? Just to tide me over, you know? Please, Diane? Come on. Yeah. For an old friend? Why not? I\\'ve been looking all over for this. Oh, you know what? I only got a 20. A 20 is good. - Yeah? - Yeah! A 20 is great, yeah. That would help me out a lot. - You want a 20? - Yeah. Why don\\'t you go buy yourself some pretzels, you asshole. You bitch! You\\'re nothing but a whore! I don\\'t give a shit about your clothes! You\\'re still a whore to me! Yeah? Shut up. Look at you. Oh, are you desperate now, baby? Who\\'s a whore now? Don\\'t talk to me like that, you bitch! Who\\'s laughing, stupid? Don\\'t play a game with me! I know you! Shit. Oh, man. Shit. Mickey. Mick, what\\'s up, man? Hey, what\\'s up, man? Did you get anything? No, not a dime. You score? Yeah, I got something. What\\'d you get? About 35 bucks. 35? Where\\'d you get it? I robbed some fucking asshole on the \"D\" train. Dude, 35 will keep us on for, like, two days. Well, could we get some stuff, man? I\\'m fucking... my head is... I see some spics. I think we can score. You wanna check it out? - Yeah, alright. - Come on. They\\'re over here. Why the fuck do we have to cop on the street all the time? My fucking nuts are itching like crazy. Think this is him? Is your name Pino? Listen... could we get us some dope? The dude over there said you could help. You want to cop some shit? Let me see some cash. I got it here. Let me see. Hey, no money without no taste. You want a taste? Don\\'t worry. Don\\'t worry. Hurry, man. Come on. There\\'s fucking cops all over. That\\'s good, man. That\\'s good. All right, listen... 4 for 35. 4 for 35, man? Come on, man. $5.00 short. What\\'s the big deal? Ta bien, chico... Toma, toma. - You got four? - Yeah. We should taste this. Where are we going to cook it up? I don\\'t know about his guy. No, he\\'s cool. Fuck, man! What\\'s the matter? - Just taste it! Come on. - What do you mean? I tasted it. He beat us. He fucking beat us. I swear to fucking God... Put that away! I\\'m gonna kill this mother-! - Come here, motherfucker! - Put it away! I\\'m going to fucking kill you, you motherfucker! Motherfucker, you\\'re fucking dead, you hear me? Dude, don\\'t make me do it. Where\\'s the money? I want the money. I want the money and the bags. Where\\'s the fucking money? The fucking money! I want it! No! - Oh, shit! - We fucking killed him! What the fuck do you mean, we? I didn\\'t fucking touch him! Don\\'t put that shit on me! He beat us, man! He deserved it! You went too far, Mickey! Oh, shit! Is he dead? Of course he\\'s fucking dead! He fell six stories! Jim, come on. Come on! Will you come one? Jim, don\\'t make me leave you here! Oh, shit. # Star # # I\\'ll reach you if I try # # Show me the truth, yeah # # Star # # I\\'ll reach you if I try # # Show me the truth, yeah ## Come on, get back up! Come on! Get off of me! What are you doing? Who is it? Ma... let me in. Ma, let me in! Please, Ma. Ma? Hey, Ma? Are you in there, Ma? Ma, is that you? Yeah. Ma? Ma? - Are you there? - Yeah. Hi. Hi, Ma. Hi. Hi. Listen, I need you to help me out, all right? I need you to give me some money. Okay? I need you to give me, like, five doll... Like, $20, something like that because I\\'m in some trouble. Ma? Do you hear me, Ma? Yeah, I hear you. I can\\'t help you. Okay, listen, what you got to do is give me some money, okay? Jim, I can\\'t do that. Why not? Mom, you know I\\'m not going to do anything with it. I just need to go out of town for a little while \\'cause I got into some trouble, and I need some help. Okay? So, you got to give me some money, Mom. Can you hold my hand? Yeah, I\\'ll hold your hand. Mom, can you give me some money, please? Mom, can you give me some money, please? Stop fucking around! I can\\'t. Mom, give me some fucking money, please! What are you doing? I\\'m your son! I don\\'t have any. Mom, don\\'t fuck around like this! Give me some money! Mom! Come on! Let me in the fucking door! Oh, God. Oh, fuck. Let me in. I need some money. I need some money real bad. Oh, God. Someone\\'s breaking into my apartment. They have a knife. Mom! You don\\'t understand, Mom. You don\\'t know what you\\'re fucking doing to me. Mom, I\\'m in pain. How could you do this to your son, you bitch? You fucking bitch! Oh, let me in! I\\'ll do anything! I\\'ll be a good boy! I\\'ll be a good boy, mom, if you let me in. Get off me! Get off! No! No! You fuckers! You\\'re not going to do this! Fuck you! Ma! Don\\'t do this! Ma! Ma! Ma! I got six months in Riker\\'s Island for assault, robbery, resisting arrest, and possession of narcotics. I sweated out a horrible cure and stayed clean the whole stretch even though it\\'s been easier to get good junk in here than it is on the street. Shit, it\\'s been hard, man. All I\\'ve been doing is reading these diaries and wondering how the hell I\\'m still alive, and even if I care. Suffice to say that I\\'m finished with the asshole bandits of shower-room rape, and suffice to say that those swine guards won\\'t draw blood from my ankles again. Suffice to say that I\\'ve been just thinking about dumb stuff like what a nice concept it is to have a godmother and a godfather, wondering who my godparents might be. My mom won\\'t visit me here, so I guess I\\'ll just have to wait till I get home to ask. Jim? Who\\'s there? It\\'s me. Pedro? What\\'s up, man? Nothing. You know. I... I hear you come here. I just came by to say hi. I\\'m sorry about that night at the candy store and everything. It\\'s all right. Reform school turned out to be real cool, so don\\'t sweat it. Did you hear about Mickey, that scumbag? He went and threw some chump off a roof. He\\'s getting 5 to 15 years, man. They tried him like an adult. Shit. I got a present for you, Jim. A bag of the finest dope in Manhattan. You know, me and you? Like old times? I can\\'t. Come on. It would be dynamite. I got this thing to do. Why don\\'t you come check it out? No. I\\'m going to go, then, you know? You know how it is. Take care of yourself, little man. Know this. There\\'s different types of users of junk. You got your rich dilettante square-ass who dabbles now and then and always has enough money to run off to the Riviera if he feels he\\'s fucking around to the danger point. Street junkies hate these pricks, but they\\'re always suckers, and their money makes them tolerable. Then you got your upper-middle-class Westchester preppies... same as the others, basically. What they\\'re good for is opening their mommy and daddy\\'s eyes to this social virus and putting pressure on the government to do something about it. Then there\\'s us street kids. Start fucking around very young, 13 or so... We think we all got it under control and won\\'t get strung out. This rarely works. I\\'m living proof. But in the end, you just got to see the junk as another 9-to-5 gig. The hours are just a bit more inclined to shadows.'\n",
      " \"This is the conclusive Kidnap andRansom Report for Mr. Pierre Lenoir. Location: Chechnya. Result: Positive. We were contracted by AGP underwriters who insured the victim. Mr. Lenoir was abducted January 21 from Russian-held territory... ...by members ofthe Chechen Nationalist Militia. Their first demand was for $5million. My ability to negotiate directly with the Chechens... ...was subverted by Russian military command... ...who monitoredmy every move. After 36 days... ...lhadnegotiated the finalransom figure down to $750,000. Finalproofoflife was received midnight Wednesday, February 27. The next morning, l was informedby the Russians... ...that l wouldbeprohibited from personally delivering the ransom. Any confidence that these men would deliver the ransom money... ...andreturn the hostage safely, had, by this point, been dissipated. Tell your colonel... ...it's his responsibility now. He's got his orders. He fucks about... ...l'll be the least of his problems. Factoring the time-sensitive interests of the group holding Lenoir... ...the limited communication available with the London office... ...and the Russian insistence... ...that they, and they alone, deliver the ransom payment. lmade the decision that there was simply no alternative... ...but to give the Russians exactly what they wanted. Knowing that l'dretain possession ofthe ransom money... ...l'dmanaged to contact the Chechens privately. We hadagreed to rendezvous at an alternative location. Transport options in this area are limited. Drive! So l did the best that l could. The group holding Mr. Lenoir... ...was responsible for a dozen kidnappings over thepast two years. This is a battle-testedguerrilla militia. They are well-armed, highly mobile and extremely unpredictable. Mr. Lenoir was found to be in an excellent state ofhealth... ...considering the circumstances. l sent the Russians away. l don't know how much time we've got. Following a review ofthe ransom payment. Mr. Lenoir was released into our care. The success ofthis extraction depended on a brisk, timely, transfer schedule. We were, however, not quite fast enough. Airborne! Come in hot, Joe. This place is going loud! Evac emergency RV. Repeat, ERV. Airborne, l have a visual! There are two dead trees in the center of the field. l'm 50 yards to the west of the south tree. Don't give me any shit, Joseph. l've got injured cargo. Get your ass down! Go! This extraction didn't go down well for the Chechens or our Russian hosts. As a result... ...my ability to function as a Kidnap andRansom consultant in the area... ...has been permanently compromised. Mr. Lenoir was examined by mobile medical... ...and as per his insurance company's request... ...transported to Athens yesterday for surgical treatment. At this time, we have contracts with all three insurance underwriters... ...holding K and R policies in the west-Asian, post-Soviet republics. This area is clearly in a critical state of transition... ...and demands the most vigorous security precautions. What did they bill last year, our three underwriters? Total premium? -$28 million. -And the ransom total? Paid out on policies? $26 million. Bloody hell. Set up some premium meetings. Wave the red flag a bit. Excellent job, Terry. Thank you. As always, outstanding. Sir. Where are we next? Pakistan? Colombia? Hello. Peter, is that you? Baby, it's me. Can you hear me? lt's about tonight. l'm shopping for dinner. The goodnews is, l'll definitely be back. Yeah? Go on. We've got to go to this thing tonight. The dinner. The charity event. You're kidding, right? No. l'm getting completely screwedhere. None ofmy equipment's here. None ofthe stufftheypromised. l've got 60 guys running around thejungle with nothing to do. Something is really messed up here. l'm going to pin these bastards down tonight. You really want to put me at a table full of oil executives? They're big boys. They can stand up to a little hippie like you. Can l tell them what l think of them? lf you really want to skip it-- No, l'll go, l'll be there. And l'll be on my best behavior. Great. Thank you, Alice. l mean it. l'llhave to borrow a dress from Norma. Get Sandro to drop my tux by the airfield before he stops back andpicks you up. Yeah, don't worry about it. Please don't leave me hanging out there with thosepeople. Andbe careful. l will. l love you. Peter, what's happening? What about the equipment? Everything is taken care of. l'm meeting with the guys from Quad Carbon tonight. His mom said he was exactly the same as a baby. She's right, you know. Hey, baby. l was worried about you. -l told you he'd make it. -Hi, Peter. -Let's find our tables. -We'll see you inside. Look at you, all decked out in Norma's duds. lt's my debut as a corporate wife. Whatever it is... ...it is working. l'm dressing like this all the time now. You ought to come around more often. -l guess l got some making up to do. -l guess so. l just want to know what the hell is going on. -Nobody called? -No. l was there all day. Hey, y'all. Sorry we're late. -Where is everybody? -Nobody called you? Are you shitting me? Fellner, Buddy and their gang left for Houston this morning. A powwow. Peggy said if he was going, she was going. l guess all the girls jumped on that. So, it's just us. Better late than never. So, lvy tell you? Houston. This morning. All of them. Fellner chartered a plane. What's in Houston? New money. Peter, look. How did it get so bad so fast? Come on, man. Where the hell have you been? l've been trying to build a dam. Pick your head up every now and then, take a look around. You're building a charity water project. As for the company, you're nothing but a humanitarian window-dressing. Quad Carbon came down here looking for a lucky break and we got nailed. We've a billion-dollar pipeline that hasn't spit out a gallon yet. Oil prices are going through the roof. We can't take advantage of it. You know, market close today... ...Quad Carbon stock down $10 and falling. The vultures are circling. Which vulture is in Houston? lt's Octonal. They're the only ones big enough to come and get this thing on track. Peter, look! Peter, look! Maybe you missed it, but this happens to be a big deal for me. l think l know that. You sure don't act like it. Maybe it's a sign. Maybe it's just a sign that we should go home. You tell me. This all falls apart, this goes away, what was the point? -The point of what? -l don't know. How about everything? How about Africa? How about Egypt? How about Thailand? How about eight years of shit postings? Eight years of working for assholes. Eight years of working on somebody else's bad ideas. Wait. l don't get it here. Suddenly the last eight years, that's just all shit now? -ls that what l said? -l thought... ...we were doing what we wanted to do. l thought we were living our lives together. That's not what l said. This isn't just a job! This is everything l have prepared for my entire life! lf Jerry's right, if it's Octonal, they come in and take this over, l'm fucked! l wouldn't get too upset about it. Maybe Octonal wants a dam of their very own. Octonal doesn't build dams, they kick ass. They don't care about these people. lt's all about profits. l don't get it. What is the surprise here? You wanted to work for an oil company. l don't work for an oil company. That's not what l'm doing here! l'm building a dam that will save people's lives! You are building a dam so an oil company can get a pipeline contract. -Who cares who pays for it? -Apparently, no one! You're drunk. No, Peter. This isn't us. -Let's just go home. -Great. That is so supportive. You don't like this place either. -l like the project. -l don't have a project! Then find a fucking project! Damn. Use your talent, your experience. There's got to be 25 agencies working down here. There's food projects, health-care projects. Any one of them would be thrilled to have you on their staff. l don't get this. You've hit the ground running every place we've ever gone. l'm sorry l'm not bouncing back fast enough for you. Five months here, you haven't even started to learn the language. l am not getting pregnant again in the Third World. No, not Africa. We're not gonna bring that into this. -''That''? -Yes, that. When the hell are you gonna move on? lt's over. lt happened. -lt wasn't meant to be. Get over it! -l don't want to move on! Well, l have. And goddamn it, l'm right here. Right now. My whole situation is falling apart and somehow, we're back to this agenda. l am not an agenda. You know what? Go home. l'm serious. Take a break. Well, it's what you want. lsn't it? l never said that. Then l guess it's me. No. Ted, tell Octonalhow much local support we've got down here. l don't know what to tell you. We're in Houston looking for help. Octonal has their own way of doing things. l'm not the only one who's going to fight for this. lf that's a threat, l'm not sure what that is. But, you lose sight.... No. Ted, you're breaking up. Don't lose track of where you stand in the food chain around here. l've got people here who've burned their bridges to come work with us. l can barely hear you. Can you hear me? Ted, whenever you're ready. What the hell am l supposed to tell my people? Tell them Quad Carbon is finished. Tell them Octonalis taking us over. Tell them to get their r�sum�s out. l'm heading for the office. l'll call you back on a landline. Beatrice, thanks for coming in on Sunday. Call Ted Fellner. Tell him l'll be at the office in 20 minutes. l've got to take the long way around. Right. l don't believe this. Fuck! Shit! My God! No. lt's a telephone! lt's just a telephone. No. l'm not doing anything! No. l just need my briefcase. l'm not part of this. l have some really bad news. You ought to go inside and sit down. lt's about Peter. This morning there was a roadblock and these guys in ski masks.... They had guns and they took him with a bunch of other people. He's been kidnapped. Do you understand what l'm saying? We got a call from Tecala this morning. You're not sending me there. -l think if you hear me out.... -l just got off the plane, okay? Terry, l need you down there. l'm just not good at the moment. l want you to consider this your first management assignment. The first of many. We all get rattled. lt's not the first time. That was kind of my point. -Sir. -Hey, Henry. l'm on my way to the airport. l'll call your mom, see if her and Michael can make it up this weekend. l'll call her. What time is kickoff on Sunday? 2:00? Yes, sir. l was really looking forward to it. Better get back out there with your mates. Yes, sir. Can l speak now? Because this is wrong. This is so wrong. l'm here to help the people of Tecala. l'm here to build a dam. No. l don't work on the pipeline. l'm here to build the dam at Chimaya. -For the pipeline. -Not for the pipeline. -Yes, for the pipeline. -Listen to me-- Listen to me. Just listen. To stop the flooding. Can you understand that? Don't you hear me? Didn't you hear me? l don't work for the pipeline! l'm here to help the people of Tecala. You are a prisoner. Una foto, por favor. That's it. This whole box is just.... We brought some albums with us. l was gonna... ...organize all this, and l just never got it together. Oh God, what's that? lt's lndia? Alice, stop now. We need just one good picture of his face. Sorry. l'm the one who's sorry. l don't understand my country anymore. No, it was completely random. He was out in the barrio. Anything can happen out there. They steal your car, your money, whatever. No, we don't really know a damn thing. Nothing definite at all. Let me call you back. You're telling him we don't know what happened? At this point, we don't know. He was kidnapped, Jerry. He was taken at gunpoint in a roadblock. Twenty-five people saw him drive away in that goddamn truck. l don't know, maybe it's me, but that sounds pretty fucking definitive. Alex, it's your sister-in-law again. Janis, did you get the flight? Welcome back, Mr. Thorne. How long will you stay this time? Mr. Peter Bowman. Let's have a look at you, mate. Janis! Alice! -Go here. Sandro will get your bag. -Okay. -Tickets, ma'am. -Okay. Yeah. Please don't lose my luggage. There's a guy waiting from England. He wants to talk to you about Peter. He says it's important. l was against this, but they insist. Sorry. l hope we did the right thing. -What's Luthan Risk lnternational? -He's a negotiator. -Shall l go with you? -No. l'll take care of it. Hi. How are you? l'm Peter's sister. Can we help you? Terrence Thorne. How do you do? Considering the circumstances, we're doing all right. How do you do, Mrs. Bowman? l'm with Luthan Risk. We're an international consultancy-- l have one. Your card. We're based in London. l'm with our Security and Crisis Response Unit. l'm sorry for appearing like this. My company is the designated K and R consultant for Quad Carbon. ''K and R.'' What is K and R? Kidnap and Ransom. -You just flew in? -Correct. Last night. Have you spoken to anyone at Quad Carbon? London may have. l was just assigned. All l've seen is an employment dossier. l'd like to get a proper file going. l've some questions, and so must you. l'll try and explain as much as l can. This is a game. lt's a game youplay, whether you like it or not. For you, it's emotional. For thepeople holding Peter, it's a business. The sooner you get comfortable and objective about that... ...the easier this willbe. People take hostages all over the world. Sometimes, it's purely terror... ...other times it's political, propaganda purposes. Down here, it's simply about money. So... ...where is Peter? Where is he now? Probably in the mountains. He's probably been taken by the ELT. Look... ...l just got off a plane. Can we back up a little bit here, please? This ELT... ...this group, who the hell are they? And how can you be so sure they're the ones who have my brother? This is a land reform movement. These people are revolutionaries. lnitially, there was a political agenda. However, what you must understand is... ...today's version ofthe EL T... ...is a completely different animal. Twenty years ago... ...they were a struggling Marxist revolutionary group in the mountains. The end ofthe Cold War changed everything. The money from Moscow dried up... ...and the ELThad to finda new way to support itself. So they got into kidnapping, which has made them millions. Then they realized they were sitting on an even bigger goldmine. Behind Colombia, Tecala is the world's largest supplier ofcocaine. The ELThad the weapons andan unlimited supply ofpoor, illiterate soldiers. They came in hardand they came in fast, and they took over the drug trade. Whatever political agenda they started with... ...has been completely perverted. Did you know that when you moved here? Listen. Can we get practical here, just for a second? Can you just explain how this works, step by step? We wait for contact, they make a demand, we start negotiating. Negotiate? What's to negotiate? Everything. We pay too fast, pay too much... ...make it look too easy, and instead of getting Peter back... ...we'llget a message thanking us for the down payment andasking for more. All that we want to do is finda number. A dollar figure that gets Peter back in onepiece as quickly as possible. No. Let me clarify something. This is not about rescues. This is not about bringing anyone tojustice. Relying on the police down here is dangerous. The army is no better. They're pumped up and trigger-happy. The last thing we need is heroics, so we rely on nobody, nobody local. And the embassy? l'm still waiting for them to call me back. The US mission down here at the moment... ...is to try andbreak the ELTand switch the country's economy from drugs... ...topetroleum. Peter does not fit into thoseplans. The embassy cannot help you and they know it. The most you'llget is a sympathetic smile anda pat on the back. How long is this gonna take? ln truth, l don't know. You need to settle in for a long haul. Nothing goes quickly in Tecala. But thepeople holding Peter, they do know what they're doing. He's a very valuable commodity, andit's in their best interest... ...to keep him healthy. Was Peter in the habit of taking off and not telling you where he would be? No. What are you getting at? How is his health? Peter's health has always been fine. -Medication? -No. -What about allergies? -No. Nothing. He's allergic to chlorine and strawberries. A blood vessel popped in his eye. He's been taking drops. And he's very prone to ear infections. What about emotionally? ls he equipped to handle this kind of stress? What kind of stress? l don't know, Frank. He doesn't know. lt could be one week, it could be six. She's Alice. What can l tell you? Alice is Alice. She's still out there, trying to save the world. -l can't tell you what she's feeling. -Who are you? l mean... ...people who do this, are you lawyers, foreign service, what? Some law enforcement, some intelligence. Mostly, it's military. -Which are you? -l was a soldier. What kind of soldier? British army. -You sound Australian. -l am. l was in the regiment at home... ...but we don't get into a lot of action down there, so l went to England. SAS. Special Air Service. ''Special,'' meaning what? Special Forces? Right. She is a trip. -Do they get on? -With Peter? She drives him crazy. Sometimes l think we've been bouncing around the world so he can avoid her. l read that in the employment dossier. The ''bouncing around.'' He shouldn't have been in that convertible. His stupid goddamn car. Tell me, what's with all the scorpions? This house. lt's insane, isn't it? Some busted drug lord, El Escorpi�n, built it for one of his mistresses. Peter called and said he had found this ridiculous, enormous house... ...that nobody wanted because it was supposed to be cursed. One of the maids comes every Monday and sprinkles holy water around. So maybe it is cursed, all that bad juju. So, this is your life. This is what you do. Go into people's houses, tell them how it is. That's part of it. Try to figure out what they're like, how they'll be and hold up. That's what you're doing, isn't it? Mrs. Bowman, l'm on your side. So, how am l doing... ...you know, for the bereaved spouse? Your husband isn't dead. He's alive. And l will do everything l can to make sure he gets home safe. This won't work if you bullshit me. l can see that. So we'll be straight up, then? That's exactly how we'll do it. Sorry. God, you'd think l'd been gone for a month. Would you like some wine? You know l don't drink. So, where were we? l like this! He's loco. Don't be afraid, we're not gonna kill you. The competition arrives. Hello, mate. l heard an ugly rumor you were around somewhere. l thought you'd gone all civilized and unsocial on us. What's this? A face-lift? Yeah, l'm doing one side at a time. You good? He looks like shit, but he's working. What are you celebrating? Life, liberty, and the ability to purchase clitoris. Jesus! Thank God you're here, Terry. Because the quality of conversation has been just ''bloody appalling.'' Where was it? Someone said you were in Turkey? Not Turkey, Chechnya. -With the Frenchman, Lenoir. -Keeping updated? My guys turned that one down. lt's a job Wyatt's outfit would take. Thought you were retiring. Yes, l was, but lnherent Risk rang me with a sob story. Could l, please? ''Old time's sake?'' What are you doing? l'm working on the biggest thing down here. He's doing the ltalian. Calitri. Banker. -Very pleased with himself. -l can tell. And lan has you off in fucking Chechnya alone. That's why l left. Luthan Risk doesn't give a shit about you, and you know it. Your cops still on the payroll? -Better than ever. Judges, too. -Will you run some names for me? That top one is this client's driver. -Shouldn't be a problem, for a hefty price. -Will we ever get a drink? l think somebody's kidnapped the barman. That's all right, mate. My shout. Bloody hell! That's just like mine. lt is yours. lt is mine. Hey, old mate. lt's good to see you. Alice, l can't tell you how shocked l am something like this could happen. Did you get my wire? How are you doing? -Janis Goodman. Peter's sister. -Ted Fellner. Peter's boss. -Nice to meet you. -Let's step into my office. l was in Houston, got this phone call. l couldn't believe it. l flew back here last night. We've got everybody working... ...trying to access the information we need to make some informed decisions. Make them quick. The right decisions. Please sit down. Would you like some coffee or tea? No, l think we're fine. Where's Mr. Thorne? The guy from Luthan Risk. Right. There's been a change in plans. What kind of change? We think it's best for all of us, under the circumstances... ...to go with a local representative. -You don't want to use Luthan Risk? -What circumstances? There's no insurance. None of us, no one at Quad Carbon, has been insured for kidnapping since July. Some idiot was trying to cut costs and didn't realize what they were doing. Alice, honey, please. This could be any one of us. We're doing our best. We're talking to Octonal, trying to get their input. We're hoping they'll step up and cover this, but at this point-- Don't they have to? Their position is, they're buying a pipeline, not the company. -lt's a bit complicated. -Their ''position''? How do they already have a position? This just happened! Could you just tell me where Quad Carbon stands in all of this? Quad Carbon is evaporating. They're selling off what they can. Just a little late for miracles. So you're all out of work? lt would seem so. Who's this? This is Arturo Fernandez. Se�ora Bowman. Mr. Fernandez has been our local security coordinator for years. He's very well connected and very experienced. lf you give us a few minutes you'll realize... ...just how lucky we are to have him working with us. Mr. Thorne, you're leaving so soon. Perhaps next time we can go dancing. Boy, did you have me fooled. -l was just about to call you. -Where, from the plane? You stood in my house and you told me that l didn't have to worry anymore. We thought Quad Carbon was still a client. What about us? We can't be the client? l really am sorry. lt's not a good situation for us either. ''Us''? You. You stood in my kitchen and you told me my husband was coming home. Quad Carbon is out of business, okay? Octonal spends $40 million a year on K and R insurance in the world. My company has 30 percent of that package. -Octonal does not like conflict. -Peter doesn't work for Octonal. That's the point and the way they want it. No Quad Carbon confusion. l'm not even supposed to talk to you. -So, this is you being brave? -No, this is me doing my job. lt's good l came by then, right? Let you get that off your chest. l'm sure it'll all work out. You know they're giving us some local security guy? Exactly the kind of guy you warned me about. What can l say? l don't make policy. Great. So when this is over and my husband is dead... ...and l'm suing these bastards, you can tell the judge... ...you did everything you could to help me out? Wait a minute. Wait! Listen to me, l'm sorry. l apologize. l'm sorry! l'm sorry to be like this... ...but... ...you are... ...the first, you are the only person... ...l've met who knows what they're talking about. So, l'm begging you, l am totally begging you to help me out on this. You asked me not to bullshit you, right? Right. l got a plane to catch. Alice, l'm sorry. We just had a call about Peter. They said to look in our car for a cell phone. This was there. They are calling back to this phone in 20 minutes. God, Alice... ...they have our phone number. My God. Peter is alive. He's definitely being held by El Ej�rcito de Liberaci�n de Tecala. He's in good health, but he's a prisoner of war. -They want $5 million for his release. -Oh, my God. Obviously, this is negotiable. They always start with a big number. He says that in order to make it better for Peter's care and food... ...and to prove to us that he's alive, they want to get a first transfer... ...as a gesture of good faith. As soon as possible. First transfer being what? 1 .5 billion pesos. -Jesus! -lt's only $50,000. Can l talk to him? No, l don't think so. This guy is going to make one last contact. He will let us know where to go for this. But, ladies... ...the important thing is that Peter is alive. This is very positive. lt's very fast. A case like this? Very fast. -Honest. -Could you excuse us for a minute, please? Sure. Thank you. l am not trusting that man with $50,000. -What is the alternative? -You feel good about this? About him? This whole thing feels thrown together. lt feels out of control. There's more than one person who does this. You've been calling for two days and nothing! l want to wait for the guy in Miami. How long, five days, two weeks? You want to comparison-shop? Peter is alive now! Peter is my little brother. l'm trying to be smart about this. l've never done this before. l know. l'm just.... l know. l know. Ask him where he thinks l'll go? Ask him how long l have to be here. What did he say? Never mind. lt's okay. Lord Lucan is actually living in the Ukraine. ln a sanatorium. Terry. -Welcome back. -Hello, Terry. Pleasure seeing you again. Round at Westminster and back down to Greenwich, please. l'll have two of these, please. Here's to dodging bullets. We almost lost a $12 million contract over this Quad Carbon fiasco. Octonal got quite put off by the whole adventure. l'm sure you did, as well. Quite right, too. l'll make it up to you, Terry, l will. So, what happens to these people? Who? The Bowmans. What happens to them now? Come on. They'll find a way through. We've got half a dozen firms on our backs. Believe me, somebody wants this case. Okay. Who? Name a company that doesn't have Octonal business that you'd trust. Trust with your own family. They'll be fine! Look... ...l got a trip to Bangkok. Two or three days at the most. Strictly management assignment. Wave the flag. Talk to a few people. After that, l thought you might want a trip to the beach at Phuket. lf you're handling the twenties, it's fifty. -And if you're handling fifties-- -l know. Don't! Damn it! -Shit! This is ridiculous! -Janis. -Hold on. How many did you have? -l had 50. Why does everyone keep asking how much money l have? Please, Mr. Fernandez. Come on, Janis. Calm down. Are you expecting someone? No. Watch out! This guy is so.... Maybe it's Elio. -Whoever it is, out! -Please, let me handle it. What are you doing here? l wanted to apologize. l thought you did that already. My God, it's you! -Hello, Janis. -What do you want? l wanted to tell you l'm sorry about the way things went. Great, it's just that... ...we're in the middle of something. l understand your reluctance, but l want to offer you my services. Haven't we done this already? -l thought your hands were tied. -They were. What about your company? l'd be doing this alone. Se�ora, please! -What's all this? -We're putting together a payment. -What kind of payment? -For Peter. A good faith payment. -Good faith? -We're getting a proof of life. Who put this together? How are you doing? l'm Terry Thorne. What do you have here? We got one, two, three guys with guns. A shitload of money. Holy snapping assholes, look at this! Tell them to put those guns down! All right! l asked you not to come in. Maybe these ladies don't understand. But you understand! -l get this. -You want to talk, come back later! -Like when the money is gone? -There you go. Okay. All right. That's what l'm doing. l do this for a living. l do this all the time. This is my job, you know? You never buy a proof of life. Bullshit! You don't know what you're talking about. You never pack money in your client's house unless it's a fucking emergency. And you don't wave guns around people you're trying to help. Don't do that! Put your gun down or l'll blow your head off. Now! Just calm down. Do it! There you go. What are you gonna do now, asshole? Alice. Ask him to leave. What? Thank them very much for their help and ask them to leave. Me? You are telling me? You're taking the case? -Yes. -Enough with this. Leave, now. Mr. Fernandez... ...l'd like you to go. -You heard Mrs. Bowman. -l'm not going anywhere, pal. You are. Now! Can l make a suggestion? Can hardly wait, can l? l think you should calm down, then look over there and meet my friend. Arturo. -Down. Put the fucking thing down. -l thought you'd gone legit. Dino. Yeah. Let's go. All right, you too. Right now! Okay. Let's get this all cleaned up. When are you guys gonna put those things away? Have a cigarette, it might help. Sandro's going around again. Eliodoro is ready now. We are the talk of the town. -ls it complimentary? -You'd be flattered. -Where's Mrs. Bowman? -Check the kitchen. -Hey. -Yeah? That was fun? Yeah. Mrs. Bowman? Alice? Dino and Sandro are taking the dummy bags into town. Make it look good. We'll keep the cash here. l need to know, was there any kind of plan? Was there a contact schedule? No. We're just waiting for another call. l haven't cried since this started. lt's just.... Hey, it's okay. lt's just the tension. Finally, it just.... lt's okay. Why are you doing this? Nobody was going to take your case. Nobody any good, anyway. l know. But you came back. We have to do this my way, right? We'll do it together, but you've just got to.... Even if it gets tough. You have to learn to trust me. -'Morning. -How are you? We've been listening to this all night. Est�pido is right. So, what are you doing here? -Linda, you're smart, a good person. -l have no family. This is not your family. They are my family. -Let me be your family. -No. -They are my family. -They're not your family. Linda. Please. Just help me. You can do it. Help me. -Who answered the phone? -Maria. l was in the shower. -Janis stayed in case there are more calls. -Where did they hide it? Look for the Jesus with the purple robe. Under the altar cloth. -Did you get it? -lt's good. We got radio frequencies, times to call. We're on for Wednesdays and Sundays. l'd like five minutes alone with you, without your gun. l'd take your whole fucking world apart without breaking a sweat. Comprende? l want my shirt, l want my spoon. Aim that fucking thing at me one more time.... Show me how fucking big you are! l'll make you eat that goddamn rifle! -He wants the family. -Tell him to forget it. We represent the family. Just do it. Do it. Put his wife on the radio right now, or we forget the whole fucking thing! Who is this? l saidl want to speak with the wife. Who is this? You can call me Tio. What's your name? Callme Marco. You're not making all the rules here. We wanna work with you. We want a proof of life and we're not paying for it. lf there's any good faith, it can start with that. Okay, Uncle Tio. So you are the one in charge now? That's right. Good. Then you willbe responsible for the death ofPeter Bowman. Do you understandme? You are responsible! -He's gone? -Yeah. lt's all right, just get used to it. lt's the way it's done. Goddamn it. l've never seen you smoke. l smoke when l play cards. ls that supposed to be reassuring? This is how it goes. Okay? They've come to us. We've established radio contact. This is all positive. Who do you care about? l told you you'd have to trust me, and you said you could. Dino says you have a 13-year-old son. Yeah. Surprised? What if it was him? What if it was your son up there in the mountains? l would find somebody that l could trust and l would do what they told me. So, what's your son like? He's quiet. Smart, you know. Seems to make good friends. Good rugby player. You know, l see him all done up... ...and l think, God, he's just at the end of being a boy, and... ...l missed it. Just haven't been there for him. You know, truthfully... ...we really don't know each other. When he talks to me it's like he's on a parade ground. So he's a soldier like his dad. No. He wants to be a pilot and get all the girls. And his mother? Now, there's the soldier. l guess she'd have to be. Do you know how an English general's daughter gets back at Daddy? She marries an Australian. You never remarried? l took up the veil, you know? This job. You gotta have rhythm, you start moving, and... ...it just takes over. Name. Peter Bowman. Come. You stay here. What? Quiet! Whisper! You came today from the mountains? l'm Kessler. Erich Kessler. Peter Bowman. You know my name? l'm a missionary. You know something... ...perhaps, about my situation? Some news? No, l don't know. Are you a hostage, too? There's an ltalian. Up the hill, at the farmhouse. He came a week ago. ls he your friend? No, l was brought here alone. What kind of camp is this? Once it was only for drugs... ...to make cocaine at the river. But now from the fighting... ...it's all for soldiers. How long have you been here? You need soap for your feet? Maybe tomorrow, l can steal some. How long have you been here? Nineteen months. They think l'm crazy. Dover. -Terry, l'm sorry. -This is Alice Bowman. Janis Goodman, Dover McLoon, consulate officer. l know we scheduled to meet today, but something's come up. -We've been waiting for an hour and a half. -l know that. l really want to hear about your progress. l'm sympathetic, we all are, but... -...we've got a situation. -What kind of situation? l really just think we have to reschedule. He's sympathetic. What the hell does that mean? The ELT just let off three car bombs around the city. They've threatened the embassy. lt's a mess. l gotta go issue a statement. -That's okay, you stay safe. -Thanks. We need to clear out. They've had a bomb threat. -What's happening? -Get in the car! What's this? -ls it from them? -Don't open that. -lt's from them, isn't it? -Open it! Put your seat belts on, we're going to the hotel. -Just open it. -Not here. Okay, how about a nice big smile, you skinny motherfucker. Shit! Close the door. Take a seat. Just open it. Please, just open it. Come on. ls it a proof of life or not? Give me a minute and take a seat. lt is. lt's a proof of life, isn't it? Usually, l do this by myself, okay? Just wait a minute. There's things here that they want us to see. You never get a pretty picture, okay? His feet. He looks terrible. What happened to his feet? You said... ...that they knew he was valuable. That they would take care of him. What are you doing? This is it, right? The one he's holding in the picture? -What, do you save all the papers? -This is good news, okay? l mean, this is good luck. lt's what we've been waiting for. We're in play. All we have to do now is start talking specifics. Money. l need to know exactly how much l've got to work with. You'll have to get back to Denver and start putting this cash together. We're gonna shoot for $600,000. l'm hoping that's where we land. Thank you. Don't be a fool! Stop it! Calm down! lt's nothing! You see up there... ...the farmhouse? That's where they've got the ltalian. On the other side, down the valley... ...that is where they make cocaine. When you get home, you'll want to talk about this. lt's normal. l know. lt's not restaurant conversation. lt's not for my friends, it's not even for my kids. -Right. -Right. Turn that scramble phone on, test it out straight away. lf it doesn't work, l'll come up with something else. You're doing great. Thank you. lt's not every soccer mom who gets her own encrypted phone, right? lt's a lot of money. $600,000. He's not even sure. l know. l know you've got the kids, tuition, your mortgage. l know all of it is impossible to ask. But you're our only chance. What if it's more? l don't know. But l swear, if it takes every day, for the rest of my life, l will pay you back. l will. l'm sorry if l've been.... lt's just that l'm trying to get through this, trying to be... ...strong. He's lucky to have you. Don't worry. -What's that? -The alarm. When they ring the bell... -...the army is crossing the river on a raid. -Where are they going? To protect their cocaine factories. lt's becoming a war. -What is it? -Nothing. What was that? ELT sending a message. lt's got nothing to do with us. Let's go. $3 million is theprice for Peter Bowman. That's a ridiculous figure. This is not a businessman. He's an engineer, here to construct a dam. You're gonna have to come down from $3 million. Like this is a game. We are saying concrete things... ...and you are having us suck cock with this bullshit. At $400,000... ...you're already over my limit. So, what you need to do is take that offer back and see if.... -What the hell are they bringing back? -lt's a French helicopter. How would you know that? What the hell is that? l've got very goodnews for you. l've got another $50,000 for you. $50,000 changes nothing! lmight as well walk across the camp... ...go into his cell, andblow his brains out. Alice. He's nowhere near Peter. How do you know? That's a weather sheet from last Sunday. When l was talking to him... ...it was raining and when it was thundering, l heard it on the radio. lt's not raining in the mountains, and we know Peter's three days away. That means that this guy is in this city. Marco, if... ...you are near Peter Bowman, go and get him and put him on the radio... ...so he can talk to his wife, and we'll accept that as a proof of life. Over. Do you copy? You must understand that you're dealing with a single family here. We know he works for that oil company Octonal. We know that Octonalis the biggest oil company in the world. Peter Bowman doesn't work for Octonal. Peter Bowman was here, subcontracting.... -lt's her. Alice. -Beautiful. lasked for $3 million, l come down to two. lt's an insult. He's losing faith in the family, and especially in the wife. This is bullshit. You know him. We can't be responsible for what he may do to himself! l think wejustput a bullet in his head and sell you the body. l couldn't listen anymore. lt's all right. You okay? People say things happen for a reason. You must get a lot of that, right? l had a miscarriage eight months ago. ln Africa. lt wasn't anybody's fault. lt wasn't Peter's fault. Not like l didn't try to blame him, or... ...blame myself like l deserved it, like there was a reason. lf l could just figure it out. l thought if l wasn't the one keeping control, everything would fall apart. And l thought that l could just... ...make it all happen. The places we've been, like Thailand... ...Africa. There's so much pain, you know. You can't possibly make any sense out of it. You can't push it away, even if you're paralyzed by it. What good are you? So... ...you let it go. And now that you don't have control? lt's like a faith. Once you let go... ...everything becomes clear. All the stupid, stupid shit that l worried about. Everything that l put her through. lt's like, since the baby, l.... lt's like everything l learned along the way somehow didn't apply to me, too. You think l would have gotten the message. l gotta get through this. l gotta get home. Things don't happen for a reason. They just... ...happen. My daughter is buried in Africa. Who can explain that? What was her name? Mali. Mali Jasmine Bowman. lt's a beautiful name. Nobody ever asked me that. Okay, Marco. We've got $475,000. That is not a goodnumber! Marco, you've got to think about it. lt is a good number. lt's the right number. lt's the only number. There is no company, no insurance. All you're dealing with is the family. This babble is bullshit. They need to start thinking harder, like around $2million... ...or they'llnever see him again. We should close at $500,000. We should look at $500,000. You can forget it. The family has worked very hard. This is the complete net worth and assets of this man's family. lt's not possible. lam trying, you understand? lam working mypeople. lam trying to make this happen. But lneed something from you. You give me nothing, nothing! Marco, we got $600,000. $600,000 changes nothing. The maintenance alone for this brother is more than you are offering. lf that changes nothing... ...then you'll have to come up with a number that does start to change things. lfyou go to $650,000 l will take that back to mypeople. You think you can get $650,000? Right, Marco. We're going to close it at $650,000. Okay. l willgo to mypeople andl'll talk to you again on Sunday night. No. lt's all right. l'll be over here. Peter. -What are you doing? -Be quiet! -Are you crazy? -Watch for me! -What are you doing? lt's too dangerous. -Give me your Bible. -What for? -Give me your goddamn Bible! Watch. lt's all right! Jesus, we're right there. And there is the pipeline. Hurry up. l can't believe we're so close. They are coming back. You're crazy. You're risking our lives. Okay, almost. Goddamn fool! l'm going to bring it back! l'll take it back. No, it's too dangerous. l'll do it. Look at me! These pigs are lucky to have you. Muy lucky. That's for your main account. The others are subsidiary accounts. -l'm signing all these? -And initial each page. You have to keep each account under $200,000. Anything over that, they put a magnifying glass on it. Once the accounts are available, it takes less than an hour... ...for the funds to be transferred from your bank in Denver. Dino, that third drawer down at the bottom, there's candles. Maria, can you grab me some candle holders? Sorry about that. Don't apologize, one has to live with these guerrillas, l suppose. Torch it up. There. Careful. We need to initial the passport numbers. The host with the most. Just like your last birthday party. What happened at your last birthday party? Terry popped out of a cake... ...scared the shit out of us. lt's a K and R thing. You got to get me a pair of those boots. l'll never make it out of here in these. -You won't make it without me. -No! l'm not going to be responsible for you. This is my decision. For me. Once l start, l'm not gonna turn back. You're not responsible. Erich. l have to get back to my wife. l have to. lf l stay here, l'll die. l know it. This is not your problem. l'm coming with you. l can't stay here alone. Not now. l'd go crazy. Marco, it's Tio. Acknowledge? Marco, it's Tio. Do you copy? Over. ls this thing usual? What is this? A ploy? What is he doing? He said he'd be on the radio on Sunday. He's taking the figure back. -That's a deal. -Where is he? Marco, if for some reason you can hear me... ...but l can't hear you... ...we have to work out some other way of communicating. Marco, do you copy? Acknowledge. Marco, do you copy? lt's Tio. Calling Marco, do you copy? We're getting a little anxious to know if this deal is 100 percent. Ask if Peter is all right, can you? We need some kind of indication that Peter Bowman is okay. Which way? The river's got to be this way! Get up! We gotta keep moving! -Come on! -No, you got to get out of here! Take this! Get the map out of here! lt's your only chance. -Promise me you'll keep going. -l promise. Shit! Where's your pigs? Marco, this is Tio. Do you copy? Good day. You better get out of there. -What's up? -The German. Kessler. That missionary fella? He's out. Some farmer dumped him at one of my precincts last night. What's that got to do with me? He says he was with Peter. He says they made a run for it. lt doesn't sound good, Terry. For the meals, we could eat together. But the food, it's nothing. lt's just to keep you alive. But Peter would transform this crap into a feast. He would say: ''Tonight, let's see what Alice has made for us.'' Alice... ...you were everything for him. He talked about you and your daughter, Mali... ...all the time. He loved you both so very much. You have to know-- l'm so sorry. He didn't see him killed. He didn't see a body. He heard a shot. You gotta wake up. You gotta get real on this. You don't spend that much time working on a deal and kill your hostage. When was the last time you had contact? A week? Two weeks? l've just had nothing but 22 days of static. Maybe there are no more deals to be had. Maybe this is coming apart. Maybe he's alive. Maybe he is. Maybe he is. But what we do know is that my guy is still up there... ...and they don't know Kessler's out. They think he's dead. Kessler knows every inch of that camp, and he's willing to help me. -He's a missionary-- -He's not! He is from the French Foreign Legion. So what? He found God. He's got a map in there. A map that l think is real. Where are you going with this? Okay. This has to stay quiet. And she has to know that. You're thinking of going in? ls that what you're thinking? Fuck thinking. That's what l'm doing. l'm in there on the telephone. That's all l can do. Tell me what else l should do. Talk to me before you do anything, okay? For you, l can do that. For you. lf you don't keep me up to speed, l'm gonna take it personally. You've been doing that a lot lately. l can't hear any more of this! -Wait! -An eyewitness saw him killed. Until we know for sure, this has got to stay in play. What are you doing? Why are you doing this? He didn't see a body. Peter is dead! Let me grieve! -Why can't you do that? -lnstinct. Until l know, until l'm sure... ...until l've received a visual confirmation of the body of Peter... ...l'm looking to retrieve my cargo and complete my mission. She's just a girl. She's too young to be involved in this, please. lt's very dangerous for her. How are you doing? l thought we had a deal going. l haven't heard from you in two weeks. l miss you. Why don't you call me ''Tio''? And l'll call you ''Marco.'' You've got a good game going. Your wife thinks you're out with the card buddies... ...they think you're off with a mistress. And there you are, on the radio, every Wednesday night... ...bartering human life. This is a tape of my friend Marco. lt's not the only one. ls Peter Bowman alive? ls Peter Bowman alive? He tried to escape. He was hurt. He's alive. ls he with the ltalian, Calitri? How did you find me? Now, l have $600,000 waiting. l'll get another $50,000 off the books... ...between you and me, if we get this done. Or l've got this tape. l'll lay it on your golfing buddies and you don't make it out of the car park alive. So, let's just get this deal done, shall we? lt's not the money. That doesn't matter anymore. lt's always the money, Fred. You have $1 billion? Because that's the money we are talking about. You think Octonal will buy this pipeline without a promise from the army... ...to completely destroy us? That pipeline goes right through our coca fields! They are buying a war. Peter Bowman will never get down. He knows too much. We are fighting for our life. Listen to me. There are no more deals. Enjoy the parade, Fred. This is the camp. He said they call it Canyon Verde. This is the river. This valley, the big one below, is very active. Every time the army moves through, there's a skirmish. March, May and June. Kessler said that every couple of weeks, the whole camp would run out and fight. -Pipeline? -Fifteen clicks down river. Terry Thorne. Tomas Morales. These guys are top. They're my Panama crew, l trained them myself. So, simply, all we have to do... ...is encourage the army to cross the river. Right about here would be convenient. Start a battle, drain the camp. Drop into this flat area. While they're fighting, we slip in from behind, extract cargo and exit. Basically, we just call the army, schedule a battle. How would Wednesday around 3:00 be for you? We don't call them, mate. Alice will do it for us. Can you get a bird? Crew plus seven? Are you in love with this woman? l don't know what you're holding out hope for. You'll save her husband, she'll see the light and run off with you? lt doesn't work that way. You know that. l want to cash out of here. l want my own shop. lf we could pull this off.... This is the stuff of legends. We could sell this. Don't get me wrong. l would love to go out of here a winner. But l have been over this and over this a thousand times, and it's fucked! So we're on, then? Absolutely. You're gonna have to lie, Alice. You got to totally bullshit this bastard. We've got to get the army to in vade ELTterritory tomorrow. Peter's life depends on it. Youjust have to walk in there... ...you walk right up to Fellner and you flat-out lie. Andhe's got to buy it, or we run out ofoptions. Alice... ...are you... ...okay? ELT wants $1 million for Peter. We don't have it. That's a lot of money. lf l gave you information for protecting the pipeline... ...would Octonal step up and do the right thing? What kind of information are we talking about? Alice, stop! Alonzo, don't go away. l'll be right back. Alice, come on. You think l don't wake up every morning and think about Peter? l have had a dozen meetings with the transition team about this situation. Just how wrong l think it is. Fuck you, Ted. Look... ...l'm not sure what we're talking about here. But you give me something to work with... ...and maybe l can push this the last mile. ELT is going after the pipeline tomorrow. l know where. Do you step up for Peter or not? l don't know what you think you're trying to accomplish... ...or what you think you know, or how stupid you think l am... ...but l get three military briefings a week. lt's a good bet that if anyone knew what was happening here, it would be me. ls that a no? How could you possibly know this? And who the hell is that? l'm Kessler. Erich Kessler. Two phosphorous, two smoke, two HE... ...two flashbangs per mag. G-36. But it's a British kick. -One day's rations. -One day? l've just come from an urgent sit-down with our old friend Dover McLoon... ...at the embassy, who's freaked out today over a rebel push up towards Rio Verde. Nice going, Alice. Ready to rock, Terry. Kit inspection in 15 minutes. We're on the bird in an hour. You heard the man. Let's go! Let's go! We've got to move right now. Don't make me wait. Coming at us. We got to prep that LZ right now! l've never seen you nervous. Yes, you have. l make it 90 to 100. And that ain't no overnight stay. Kessler's map is perfect. Peter is the engineer. l'm impressed. Fellner does have clout. ln less than 24 hours, the army... ...has crossed the river. How silly. Well, my old mate... ...why don't you wander uptown? l'll catch you on the flip side. Downtown-3 is in position. Copy, Downtown-3. Downtown-1, stand by. This is Uptown-1 .

The second applicant (\"Forbes Australia\") was, at all material times, a company incorporated in Australia which carried on business both within and outside Australia.Prior to September 1997, Forbes Australia was a specialised company based in Brisbane which provided services to the concrete industry, notably in relation to establishment of plants and the construction of equipment for transportation of concrete.After the sale of shares of Forbes Australia in September 1997 the company continued to carry on business in the same industry.Until September 1997 the owners of the shares in Forbes Australia were two companies, Pearlbunch Pty Ltd (\"Pearlbunch\") and Talrate Pty Ltd (\"Talrate\"), both of which were controlled by the first respondent, Mr Forbes, as sole director.Mr Forbes was sole shareholder of Pearlbunch, and was also the sole director and (with Mrs Forbes) a shareholder of another company, Forbes Screens Pty Ltd (\"Forbes Screens\").At the time of the share sale agreement executed by Forbes Asia as purchaser and Pearlbunch and Talrate as vendors on 22 September 1997 by which the shares in Forbes Australia were transferred to Forbes Asia (\"share sale agreement\"), Mr Forbes was the managing director and chief executive officer of Forbes Australia.He retained this position until 22 February 2000.At all material times Mr Forbes and Mrs Forbes were joint owners of certain property described as Lot 8 on RP 229240, County of Stanley, Parish of Toombul (\"Lot 8\").Until 15 June 2000, Forbes Screens owned an adjoining property (\"Lot 9\").Leases of Lot 8 and Lot 9 On 17 September 1997 Mr Forbes and Mrs Forbes entered into a lease of Lot 8 with Forbes Australia.On 22 September 1997 Forbes Screens entered into a lease of Lot 9 with Forbes Australia.Share Sale Agreement The shares in Forbes Australia were transferred to Forbes Asia on 22 September 1997 for a purchase price of $3.9 million.The share sale agreement took place following what appear to be extensive negotiations during July, August and September 1997 between the parties.The initial negotiations in respect of the acquisition took place primarily between Forbes Asia represented by Mr Poh, and the interests of the vendors of the shares in Forbes Australia represented by Mr Forbes.Formal discussions in the period prior to execution of the share sale agreement involved the parties\\' legal representatives (including Mr Steven Grant for Mr Forbes and the vendors and Mr Freddy Chan for the purchasers) and accounting advisers.I shall return to consider these negotiations later in this judgment, because findings in respect of the negotiations are important in relation to a number of the applicants\\' claims in this case.Key provisions of the share sale agreement for the purposes of these proceedings were cl 2.3 and cl 3.3, Annexure 1 and cl 3.4.The purchase price for the shares in Forbes Australia was to be paid in three tranches or \"cash injections\".Clause 2.3 of the share sale agreement provided for the circumstances of the payment of third cash injection in the amount of $1,099,999.Of that amount, $500,000 (referred to as \"the Retention Sum\") was to be retained in escrow unless the terms of cl 3.4 were satisfied and the balance of the purchase price was paid.Clause 3.3 provided as follows:  3.3 The Vendors shall guarantee, ensure and cause the Company to achieve the following audited profits before tax during the following financial years of the Company provided always that the audited said profit before tax is calculated by reference to the formula set out in Annexure 1 attached hereto:-   3.3.1 For the financial year ending 31st December 1997 --- A$1,300,000.00   3.3.2 For the financial year ending 31st December 1998 --- A$1,400,000.00 and   3.3.3 For the financial year ending 31st December 1999 --- A$1,500,000.00   For the financial year ending 31st December 2000, the Vendors shall use its best endeavour to cause the Company to achieve an audited profit before tax of A$1,600,000.00. (The guarantees referred to in cl 3.3 were referred to throughout the proceedings, and shall be referred to in this judgment, as \"the profit guarantees\".) Annexure 1 to which cl 3.3 referred provided:  Clause 3.3: Formula for calculating the audited Profit before tax of the Company:-   The calculation for the audited profit before tax of the Company shall be in accordance to Australian Accounting Standards as per audited financial statements but excluding extraordinary items, abnormal items, gain or loss on disposal and/or revaluation of assets, expenses relating to research and development, provisions for long service leave and additional depreciation and amortisation resulting from the value of any item (for depreciation or amortisation purposes) being increased over that item\\'s value for that purpose as at 30 June 1997. In summary, cl 3.4 required the vendors\\' solicitors to hold the $500,000 Retention Sum for 365 days from the date of the agreement in their trust account, following which the monies would be withdrawn and specifically applied towards payment of certain accounts.Side Letters Containing Written Indemnity and Guarantee Agreement On 22 September 1997, the same day as execution of the share sale agreement, Mr Forbes and Mrs Forbes executed two \"side letters\".Forbes Guarantee The first side letter executed by the respondents (the \"Forbes Guarantee\" also referred to in the proceedings as the \"1st Lot 8 Side Letter\") was addressed to Forbes Asia.It recited the execution of the share sale agreement and the lease of Lot 8.The document then continued:  1.We hereby unequivocally and irrevocably admit and acknowledge that:-  1.1 the Vendors are our nominee and it was at our requests that you agreed to enter into the SS Agreement with the Vendors;  1.2 in view of paragraph 1.1, all the warranties and representations and covenants and obligations made or assumed by the Vendors under the SS Agreement are actually our representations and warrants and our covenants and obligations; and  1.3 as regards the Vendor\\'s (and hence our) covenants under Clause 3.3 of the SS Agreement, it was agreed that in the event that the audited profits before tax of FEH shall fall short of the amount guaranteed by the Vendors (and hence us), we, as Lessors under the Lease shall agree to reduce the total rent (\"Rent\") payable by FEH during the twelve (12) months period immediately following the last day of that particular financial year of FEH where the amount of the audited profit before tax so guaranteed is not achieved. 2.In consideration of you entering into the SS Agreement with the Vendors at our requests, we hereby agree, covenant and undertake as follows:-  2.1 guarantee the performance and compliance by the Vendors of all the Vendor\\'s obligations and covenants under the SS Agreement and:-  2.1.1 do, execute and perform such things, documents and acts as requested by you at any time and from time to time to ensure that the Vendors shall so comply with their obligations under the SS Agreement; and  2.1.2 indemnify you for all loss and damages suffered and costs and expenses incurred by you as a result of the Vendor\\'s failure to so comply with the Vendor\\'s obligations and covenants under the SS Agreement; and to pay to you on demand such losses and damages and costs and expenses;  2.2 as regards the reduction of the yearly rent for the Lease under paragraph 1.3 above, we agree to and covenant in terms of the provisions set out in paragraph 3 below; and  2.3 use our best endeavours to ensure that the suppliers and trade creditors of FEH and Forbes Industries Pty Ltd (\"FI\") will accept the take over of FI\\'s debts with them by FEH\\'s new subsidiary, Forbes Industries (Australia) Pty Ltd (\"FIA\") and that such suppliers and trade creditors shall continue to offer to FIA such credit terms which are not less favourable than those now enjoyed by FI.Reduction of Rent under the Lease   3.1 If the audited profit before tax (\"Pretax Profit YE/97\") of FEH calculated in the manner as provided under the SS Agreement for the period 1.1.97 to 31.12.97 (\"YE/97\") shall not be more than A$1,300,000.00 (\"P/Profit Target\") then we hereby irrevocably and unequivocally discharge and release FEH of all obligations to pay to us such proportion of the Rent payable by FEH to us for the period 1.1.98 to 31.12.98 (\"YE/98\") which is equivalent to the difference (\"Profit Shortfall\") between the said P/Profit Target for YE/97 and the said actual audited Pretax Profit YE/97.If the Profit Shortfall exceeds 100% of such Rent, then we shall release and discharge FEH of FEH\\'S obligations and liabilities to pay to us the Rent for YE/98.If the Profit Shortfall is less than such Rent, then FEH shall deduct such Profit Shortfall from the Rent for YE/98.Such deductions shall be recovered by FEH by deductions of the same amount to the Rent payable by FEH to us under the Lease (for the YE/98).3.2 As regards the Rent payable by FEH to us for the period 1.1.99 to 31.12.99 (\"YE/99\"), the same formula set out in paragraph 3.1 above shall apply save and except the following difference:-  3.2.1 the Rent for YE/99 shall be calculated based on the rate set out in the Lease; and  3.2.2 the P/Profit Target for YE/98 shall be A$1,400,000.00  3.3 As regards the Rent payable by FEH to us for the period 1.1.2000 to 31.12.2000 (\"YE/2000\") the same formula set out in paragraph 3.1 above shall apply save and except the following differences:-  3.3.1 the Rent for YE/2000 shall be calculated based on the rate set out in the Lease:  3.3.2 the P/Profit Target for YE/99 shall be A$1,500,000.00   4.We hereby waive all our rights to defences available to (sic) in respect of the above guarantee and indemnity under the laws of Queensland, and shall pay to you on demand all monies, losses and damages and costs and expenses, suffered or incurred by you as a result of the Vendors\\' breach or failure to comply with the Vendors\\' obligations and covenants under the SS Agreements.  5.All covenants and agreement herein made by us are so made by us jointly and severally and binding on our respective successors-in-title, heirs and personal representatives. Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee The second side letter executed by the respondents (the \"Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee\" also referred to in the proceedings as the \"2nd Lot 8 Side Letter\") was addressed to Forbes Australia.It recited the execution of the lease of Lot 8 and continued:  In consideration of your agreeing to enter into the Lease with us at our requests, we hereby agree that we are obligated to you to effect the adjustments of Rent and/or the monthly instalments of the Rent as provided in paragraphs 3.1 to 3.3 of our above letter to Forbes Engineering (Asia) Pte Ltd and you are entitled to make such adjustments in your payment of rent to us.In the event that under such adjustments we are required to refund to you such portion of the rent as have been paid by you to us, we shall pay to you on demand such refund of rent in full immediately.If we shall have defaulted in such refund, without prejudice to your rights against us for our said default, we shall pay interest at the rate provided under Clause 6.8 of the Lease on such refund calculated from the date of our receipt of your demand until the date of actual payment of such refund. Forbes Screens On 22 September 1997, the same date as the execution of the two Lot 8 side letters, Forbes Screens also executed two side letters.Forbes Screens Guarantee The first side letter executed by Forbes Screens (the \"Forbes Screens Guarantee\", also referred to in the proceedings as the \"1st Lot 9 Side Letter\") was addressed to Forbes Asia.The letter referred to the share sale agreement and the lease of Lot 9, and continued as follows:  1.We hereby unequivocally and irrevocably admit and acknowledge that:-  1.1 we are a company owned and controlled by Mark Forbes (\"MF\") and Karen Lee Forbes (\"KF\")  1.2 the Vendors are also companies owned and controlled by MF and KF and the Vendors are their nominee and it was inter alia, at our requests that you agreed to enter into the SS Agreement with the Vendors; and  1.3 in consideration thereof, as regards the Vendors\\' covenant under Clause 3.3 of the SS Agreement, we hereby agreed that in the event that the audited profit before tax of FEH shall fall short of the amount guaranteed by the Vendors thereunder, we, as Lessor under the lease shall agree to reduce the total rent (\"Rent\") payable by FEH during the twelve (12) months period immediately following the last day of that particular financial year of FEH where the amount of the audited profit before tax so guaranteed is not achieved. 2.In consideration of you entering into the SS Agreement with the Vendors inter alia at our requests, we hereby agree, covenant and undertake as follows:-  2.1 If the audited profit before tax (\"Pretax Profit YE/97\") of FEH calculated in the manner as provided under the SS Agreement for the period 1.1.97 to 31.12.97 (\"YE/97\") shall not be more than A$1,300,000.00 (\"P/Profit Target\") then we hereby irrevocably and unequivocally discharge and release FEH of all obligations to pay to us such proportion of the Rent payable by FEH to us for the period 1.1.98 to 31.12.98 (\"YE/98\") which is equivalent to the difference (\"Profit Shortfall\") between the said P/Profit Target for YE/97 and the said actual audited Pretax Profit YE/97.If the Profit Shortfall exceeds 100% of such Rent, then we shall release and discharge FEH of FEH\\'S obligations and liabilities to pay to us the Rent for YE/98.If the Profit Shortfall is less than such Rent, then FEH shall deduct such Profit Shortfall from the Rent for YE/98.Such deductions shall be recovered by FEH by deductions of the same amount to the Rent payable by FEH to us under the Lease (for the YE/98).2.2 As regards the Rent payable by FEH to us for the period 1.1.99 to 31.12.99 (\"YE/99\"), the same formula set out in paragraph 2.1 above shall apply save and except the following differences:-  2.2.1 the Rent for YE/00 shall be calculated based on the rate set out in the Lease; and  2.2.2 the P/Profit Target for YE/98 shall be A$1,400,000.00.2.3 As regards the Rent payable by FEH to us for the period 1.1.2000 to 31.12.2000 (\"YE/2000\") the same formula set out in paragraph 2.1 above shall apply save and except the following differences:-  2.3.1 the Rent for YE/2000 shall be calculated based on the rate set out in the Lease;  2.3.2 the P/Profit Target for YE/99 shall be A$1,500,000.00.Forbes Screens Lot 9 Lease Guarantee The second side letter executed by Forbes Screens (\"Forbes Screens Lot 9 Lease Guarantee\", also referred to in the proceedings as the \"2nd Lot 9 Side Letter\") addressed to Forbes Australia.It referred to the lease of Lot 9 and continued:  In consideration of your agreeing to enter into the Lease with us at our requests, we hereby agree that we are obligated to you to effect the adjustments of Rent and/or the monthly instalments of the Rent as provided in paragraphs 2.1 to 2.3 of our above letter to Forbes Engineering (Asia) Pte Ltd and you are entitled to make such adjustments in your payment of rent to us.In the event that under such adjustments we are required to refund to you such portion of the rent as have been paid by you to us, we shall pay to you on demand such refund of rent in full immediately.If we shall have defaulted in such refund, without prejudice to your rights against us for our said default, we shall pay interest at the rate provided under Clause 6.8 of the Lease on such refund calculated from the date of our receipt of your demand until the date of actual payment of such refund. I have described the guarantees executed by Forbes Screens for completeness, because the existence of these agreements is pleaded by the applicants in paras 15, 16, 17 and 18 of amended statement of claim.However the respondents plead that, as no relief is sought against Forbes Screens Pty Ltd, the matters pleaded in those paragraphs are irrelevant and embarrassing.I consider that this pleading of the respondents has merit - indeed no relief is sought by the applicants against Forbes Screens Pty Ltd. New Directors After execution of the share sale agreement and the side letters on 22 September 1997, Forbes Asia appointed two new directors to Forbes Australia to serve on the board of Forbes Australia with Mr Forbes.These directors, Mr Freddy Chan (appointed September 1997) and Mr Norman Lee (appointed July 1998) were associates of Mr Poh.Variations to Share Sale Agreement The parties to the share sale agreement executed a number of deeds of variation to that agreement (according to undisputed evidence of Mr Poh --- five separate deeds: affidavit of Poh Kiat affirmed 15 March 2006 para 11).For the purposes of these proceedings the relevant deeds were the second, third and fourth deeds of variation.The second deed of variation was executed on 12 January 1998 by Pearlbunch, Talrate, Forbes Asia, Mr Forbes, Mrs Forbes and Forbes Screens.The deed provided that it was effective to vary the share sale agreement as from 22 September 1997.The second deed recited that Forbes Asia, Pearlbunch and Talrate had entered into the share sale agreement, that Mr Forbes, Mrs Forbes and Forbes Asia had entered into a \"Letter of Indemnity\" on 22 September 1997, and that Forbes Asia and Forbes Screens had entered into a \"Letter of Indemnity\" on 22 September 1997.(It is clear that the \"Letters of Indemnity\" to which the deed refers are the Forbes Guarantee and the Forbes Screens Guarantee respectively.) The deed recited further that an error had been discovered in cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement and cll 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 of the Letters of Indemnity (Forbes Guarantee and Forbes Screens Guarantee).The deed continued:  It is agreed effective 22 September 1997 that:-  1.1 Clause 3.3 of the Share Sale Agreement is deleted and replaced by the following:-  \"3.3 The Vendors shall guarantee, ensure and cause the Company to achieve at least 90% of the following audited profits before tax during the following financial years of the Company provided always that the audited said profit before tax is calculated by reference to the formula set out in Annexure 1 attached hereto:  3.3.1 for the first financial year ending 31 December 1997 A$1,300,000;  3.3.2 for the financial year ending 31 December 1998 A$1,400,000; and  3.3.3 for the financial year ending 31 December 1999 A$1,500,000  For the financial year ending 31 December 2000, the Vendor shall use its best endeavours to cause the Company to achieve 90% of an audited profit before tax of A$1,600,000.\"  1.2 Clause 3.1, 3.2.2 and 3.3.2 of each of the Letters of Indemnity are deleted and replaced by the following:  \"3.1 If the audited profit before tax (Pretax Profit YE/97) of FEH calculated in the manner as provided under SS Agreement for the period of 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1997 (YE/97) shall not be more than 90% of $1,300,000 (P/Profit Target) then we hereby irrevocably and unequivocally discharge and release FEH of all obligations to pay to such proportion of the rent payable to FEH to us for the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 1998 (YE/98) which is equivalent to the difference (Profit Shortfall) between the said P/Profit Target for YE/97 and the said actual audited Pretax Profit YE/97.If the Profit Shortfall exceeds 100% of such rent, then we shall release and discharge FEH of FEH\\'s obligations and liabilities to pay us the rent for YE/98.If the Profit Shortfall is less than such rent, then FEH shall deduct such Profit Shortfall from the rent for YE/98.Such deductions shall be recovered by FEH by deductions on the same amount to the rent payable to FEH to us under the lease (for the YE/98).\"  \"3.2.2 The P/Profit Target for YE/98 shall be 90% of A$1,400,000.\"  \"3.3.2 The P/Profit Target for YE/99 shall be 90% of A$1,500,000.\"  The third deed of variation was executed by Pearlbunch, Talrate and Forbes Asia on 16 February 1998.So far as relevant, cl 2.2 of the third deed amended cl 2.3 of the share sale agreement in the following terms: 2.3 On or before the date of expiry of a period of 182 days from the date hereof and subject to Clause 2.7 below and the Purchaser having received all the documents referred to in Clause 2.4 below, the Purchaser shall pay into the FEH Accounts a further and last capital injection of $A1,099,999.00 (\"3rd Injection\") by way of $$599,999.00 cash and the balance by way of 1,800,000 ordinary shares (\"Teamsphere Shares\") issued by Teamsphere Ltd (Co. No 199705215 G) a public company incorporated in the Republic of Singapore and having its registered office at 1 Changi South Street 1, Changi South Industrial Estate, Singapore 486797 together with the prescribed Transfer Forms duly signed by the registered owner of the Teamsphere Shares, as the transferor thereof PROVIDED ALWAYS THAT the provisions in Clause 2.2 above shall have been complied with and the Purchaser is satisfied that the 3rd Injection shall be applied by the Company (and the parties shall ensure the company shall do so) in the following manner:-  2.3.1 firstly, to pay on behalf of the Vendors, such part of the Said Dividend (which are payable by the Company to the Vendors and the Vendors hereby irrevocably authorise such payment), amounting to A$500,000.00 by way of the delivery of all the Teamsphere Shares (together with the aforesaid signed Transfer Form) with the Vendors\\' Solicitors namely Cleary Hoare Solicitors of 1st Floor, 145 Eagle Street Brisbane (hereinafter called \"the Vendors\\' Solicitors) which said Teamsphere Shares shall hereinafter collectively be referred to as \"the Retention Sum\".The Retention Sum shall not be released or drawn upon without the written consent of the Purchaser, unless in pursuant to the terms set out in Clause 3.4 below and the BPP shall have been paid by the Purchaser to the Vendors on the Completion Date (as hereinafter defined) in pursuant to Clause 2.4 or pursuant to Clause 5.1 or 5.2.For the purpose of Clause 5.1 and 5.2, the Teamsphere Shares shall be treated as if each of them is cash of equivalent of the greater of:-  1. their market value; or  2.A$0.2778  2.3.2 secondly, payment to the Vendors such part of the Said Dividend declared and shall have been due and payable to the Vendors by way of cheque for the sum of A$371,000.00 drawn in favour of FEH subject to the Purchaser having received the following:- 2.3.2.1 a letter by the Vendors to the Purchaser authorising the payment of the said A$371,000.00 on behalf of the Vendort to Hevenfleet Pty Ltd as trustee for the Forbes Family Trust (\"FFT\") directly;  2.3.2.2 a letter by FFT to the Purchaser to pay the same A$371,000.00 (due to FFT pursuant to Clause 2.3.2.1) directly to FI; and  2.3.2.3 a letter by FI to the Purchaser to pay the same A$371,000.00 (due to FI pursuant to Clause 2.3.2.2) directly to FEH;  2.3.3 thirdly, payment to the Vendors of a sum of A$228,999.00 as full and final payment by FEH to the Vendors of the Said Dividends; and  2.3.4 fourthly, to pay on behalf of FIA, a sum of A$1.00 to FI towards full and final settlement of the net total purchase price of A$1,300,000.00 under the SB Agreement.The fourth deed of variation executed by Pearlbunch, Talrate, Forbes Asia and Mr Poh on 23 March 1998 acknowledged the earlier variations of the share sale agreement.So far as is relevant, the parties in this deed of variation varied the share sale agreement to enable the provision of 1,800,000 ordinary shares in Teamsphere Ltd referred to in cl 2.3 of the share sale agreement to be satisfied by the transfer of 180,000 shares in Teamsphere Ltd. Acquisition of Favco In October 1998 an opportunity arose for Forbes Australia to acquire the business of Hood Favco Pty Ltd (\"Favco\"), a Sydney-based business operating in the same field as Forbes Australia.Correspondence took place between Mr Forbes and Mr Poh in relation to, inter alia , the terms upon which the acquisition of Favco was to take place.Liquidity Problems It appears that subsequent to the acquisition of Favco, Forbes Australia experienced liquidity problems.Indeed there is some evidence before the Court that at one point Forbes Australia was subject to voluntary administration under Pt 5.3A of the Corporations Act (affidavit of Poh Kiat affirmed 18 December 2006 para 4).Demand On 6 April 2001 the applicants demanded the respondents pay to Forbes Australia the amounts of $127,284 and $1,691,284.These sums represented profit shortfalls alleged by the applicants to have been experienced by Forbes Australia in the years ending 31 December 1998 and 31 December 1999 respectively.The applicants\\' demands were made pursuant to the profit guarantees in cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement and as stated in the letter of demand \"the relevant side letters\".CLAIMS OF THE APPLICANT  As I observed at the commencement of this judgment, it appears that the applicants have abandoned claims against Mr Forbes in respect of breach of director\\'s duties.The remaining claims of the applicants as found in the amended statement of claim are: Forbes Asia therefore claimed the following relief: (a) a declaration that Forbes Asia is entitled to have the Forbes Guarantee specifically performed and carried into execution; and (b) an order that the respondents specifically perform and carry into effect the Forbes Guarantee by paying Forbes Australia the amount of $1,818,568.00; (c) alternatively, an indemnity pursuant to the Forbes Guarantee for loss and damage; (d) interest pursuant to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth); (e) costs; and (f) such other orders as the Court thinks fit.Forbes Australia claimed the following relief: (a) damages in the amount of $1,818,568.00; (b) alternatively, damages in the amount of $265,974.16 for breach of the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee; (c) interest pursuant to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth); (d) alternatively interest from 12 April 2001 pursuant to the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee; (e) costs; and (f) such other orders as the Court thinks fit.DEFENCE  The respondents filed a third further amended defence on 13 February 2008.The respondents conceded that cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement was in the nature of a guarantee of performance by the vendors.Notwithstanding this concession, in substance the respondents plead as follows: The share sale agreement did not permit any calculation, ascertainment or proof of the audited profit before tax of Forbes Australia by: the mere fact of preparation of a document or documents (including documents styled as audited financial statements) in purported conformity with cl 3.3; or the presentation or delivery of such document or documents; by Forbes Asia to any person who might be liable in respect of the guarantee under cl 3.3 (para 4B(ba)(i)).The share sale agreement upon its proper construction permitted the parties who were potentially liable in respect of the guarantee under cl 3.3 to undertake their own assessment, and challenge any assertion as to, inter alia , the profit earned by Forbes Australia in each of the 1997, 1998, and 1999 calendar years (para 4B (ba)(ii)).The guarantee under cl 3.3 was, upon its proper construction, premised on the continuation of certain matters set out in cl 3.1 of the share sale agreement, namely that the vendors were and remained entitled to control the make up of the board of Forbes Australia.This did not occur --- instead Forbes Asia controlled the make-up of the board of Forbes Australia and appointed new directors as and when it saw fit.Accordingly, the guarantee under cl 3.3 was discharged (para 4B(c)).Alternatively, prior to the formation of the share sale agreement, Mr Forbes provided profit forecasts to Forbes Asia in respect of Forbes Australia\\'s business as it then was, namely based entirely in Brisbane.Forbes Asia knew that the profit forecasts were based upon Forbes Australia\\'s Brisbane-based business as it then was.The profit guarantees in cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement were based on the Brisbane-based business of Forbes Australia.In 1999 Forbes Australia\\'s business was altered significantly and substantially by the acquisition of Favco.The acquisition of Favco rendered the profit forecasts originally provided by Mr Forbes inapplicable to Forbes Australia\\'s business after the acquisition.Accordingly, the acquisition of Favco was a fundamental alteration to the transaction guaranteed by the respondents and discharged the respondents from any liability under the profit guarantees (para 4B(d)).The respondents deny that they incurred any liability under the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee; alternatively that there was no valid consideration for it and accordingly it was void (para 4D).While the respondents admit the existence of the deeds of variation to the share sale agreement: the third deed of variation replaced the existing cl 2.3 of the share sale agreement with an entirely new and materially different clause.Neither of the respondents agreed to extend any existing guarantee or indemnity provided by them to Forbes Asia.The Forbes Guarantee was discharged by the third deed of variation or alternatively was unenforceable (para 4F(d)); alternatively, the fourth deed of variation substantially amended cl 2.3 of the share sale agreement which meant that the Forbes Guarantee was discharged or alternatively was unenforceable (para 4F(e)).In defence of the entire claim the respondents say that the applicants\\' cause of action arose more than six years prior to the commencement of the claim and is thereby statute barred (para 12 --- see also TS p 16 and p 17).Alternatively, the respondents say that Forbes Asia is estopped from relying on the profit guarantees in circumstances where: on or about 15 or 16 September 1997, prior to the execution of the share sale agreement and the side letters in respect of Lot 8 and Lot 9, Mr Poh on behalf of Forbes Asia said to Mr Forbes that the profit guarantees would never be enforced by Forbes Asia and were just matters necessary to be included to satisfy the demands of its parent company Teamsphere Ltd; in reliance on this representation Mr Forbes executed the documents; subsequent to the execution of the documents, Mr Poh on behalf of Forbes Asia has repeated to the respondents that it would not enforce the Profit Guarantee thereby maintaining the representation.ISSUES FOR DECISION  It is important as a threshold point to note that Pearlbunch, Talrate and Forbes Screens are not parties to these proceedings.The proceedings do not involve an attempt by Forbes Asia to enforce the terms of the share sale agreement against the vendors of shares in Forbes Australia, nor do the applicants seek any relief from Forbes Screens.Accordingly, relief sought by the applicants in the amended application for damages for breach of the share sale agreement is without foundation, because the vendors of the shares who were parties to the share sale agreement are not named as respondents to this litigation.The key issues in these proceedings relate to the enforceability or otherwise of guarantees given by Mr and Mrs Forbes in terms of the profit guarantees in the share sale agreement.Mr and Mrs Forbes were parties to the Forbes Guarantee and the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee.In my view, the following issues require decision.Did Forbes Australia experience a profit shortfall in the financial year ending 31 December 1998?What is the position of Mrs Forbes in relation to the 1998 profit shortfall?Was the effect of cl 3.3 and Annexure 1 of the share sale agreement such that the production of audited figures for the financial year ending 31 December 1999 was conclusive evidence of those figures, consistent with the decision of the High Court in Dobbs v National Bank of Australasia Ltd [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643?Was the change of control of Forbes Australia from the vendors to Forbes Asia an alteration in the factual substratum sufficient to discharge the respondents as guarantors?Did the third and fourth deeds of variation to the share sale agreement result in the discharge of the respondents as guarantors?Did the transaction resulting in the acquisition of Favco by Forbes Australia result in the discharge of the respondents as guarantors under the Forbes Guarantee?Even if the vendors\\' profit guarantees as articulated in cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement are valid, are the applicants estopped from relying on them because of the alleged representations of Mr Poh as pleaded in para 13 of the respondents\\' defence?Was the applicants\\' cause of action statute barred?Was the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee enforceable?What are appropriate rulings in relation to the notice of motion filed 12 September 2007?I now turn to each of these issues.1.Did Forbes Australia experience a profit shortfall in the financial year ending 31 December 1998?So far as concerns the 1998 financial year the applicants submit in their Statement of Facts, Issues and Contentions as follows: The respondents submitted in summary: Mr Forbes agreed with Mr Poh that the agreed profit shortfall for the 1998 calendar year was $127,284 but the agreement was founded upon a misapprehension on the part of Mr Forbes that there had been a proper accounting of all of Forbes Australia\\'s sales for the 1998 calendar year.Forbes Australia had failed to record approximately $241,000 in sales, which sales had occurred in 1998 rather than 1997.Although invoices were issued in November and December 1997, Forbes Asia asked for invoices to be re-issued to suit Forbes Asia, and therefore new invoices were issued in respect of the same goods in February 1998.Forbes Asia, by its request for the issuing of credit notes in respect of those sales, knew that the sales had occurred in 1998.Had those sales been taken up on Forbes Australia\\'s accounts for the 1998 calendar year, there would have been no profit shortfall that year.The respondents submit that those sales should have been recorded in Forbes Australia\\'s 1998 calendar year accounts.Notwithstanding statements of Mr Brauer and Mr Poh in relation to the accruals accounting basis of Forbes Australia: there is no evidence as to whether Forbes Asia treated the sales as having occurred in 1997 or 1998; the re-issued invoices state that title to the goods does not pass until payment for the goods is received (affidavit of Terrence Brauer filed 18 January 2008 exhibit \"TB 5\" invoices 23295 and 232396); Mr Lytras\\' evidence, which was not tested or challenged, its that on the face of the relevant invoice documents it is not possible to tell without access to Forbes Australia\\'s books and records whether the sales should properly be attributed to the 1997 or 1998 calendar years (affidavit of Elia Lytras affirmed 11 February 2008 para 4 and para 5).Accordingly, it would be unconscionable to permit the applicants to enforce the agreement formed on 14 January 1999.In any event, the agreement formed on 14 January 1999 did not involve, and was not binding upon, Mrs Forbes.Further and alternatively, it is an abuse of process to permit the applicants to enforce the agreement of 14 January 1999 because Forbes Australia has failed to maintain its financial records, meaning that the respondents cannot reasonably and properly identify Forbes Australia\\'s correct sales for the 1998 calendar year.Consideration For the moment placing to one side the issue of whether the basis on which the agreement was reached was flawed --- it is clear from the evidence before the Court that an agreement was reached by Mr Poh and Mr Forbes at a meeting held on or about 14 January 1999.The agreement was to the effect that Forbes Australia had suffered a profit shortfall of $127,284 for the financial year ending 31 December 1998.It appears that this profit shortfall was calculated by Mr Brauer, the accountant for Forbes Australia, and Mr Kang Ching Hong, the internal auditor for Teamsphere Ltd, and accepted by Mr Poh and Mr Forbes.It also appears that at that meeting the parties discussed the method by which the profit shortfall would be remedied by Mr Forbes.Subsequently Forbes Australia recorded the sum of $127,294 as a prepayment of rent payable under the Lot 8 lease in the books of account of Forbes Australia.A clear inference may be drawn that this action was in accordance with both the Forbes Guarantee and the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee which as already noted provided respectively that Mr and Mrs Forbes guaranteed certain profits and that any profit shortfall would be met by way of waiving lease payments.The fact that the oral agreement between Mr Poh and Mr Forbes did not result in a written amendment to the Forbes Guarantee does in my view detract from the validity of the agreement with respect to the 1998 profit shortfall so far as concerns Mr Forbes, where the agreement was implemented by reference to journal entries in the accounts of Forbes Australia (cf Koenigsblatt v Sweet [1923] 2 Ch 314).Notwithstanding the agreement reached by Mr Poh and Mr Forbes however, it also appears clear that despite the relevant journal entry Forbes Australia continued to pay Mr Forbes rent in respect of the Lot 8 lease (TS p 302 ll 9-11).Subsequently a journal entry reversing the prepayment was entered in Forbes Australia\\'s general ledger on 30 June 1999.The fact that this event occurred does not appear to be in doubt (for example evidence that it occurred was given by Mr Brauer in his affidavit sworn 25 January 2006 para 28).Prima facie on these facts, it follows that if the 1998 profit shortfall agreed by the parties on 14 January 1999 is enforceable, not only is that amount ($127,284) outstanding from the respondents, but because Forbes Australia continued to pay rent of Lot 8 and Lot 9 and any purported prepayment of rent was reversed in the accounts, the applicants have substantiated their claims that: However despite the agreement of 14 January 1999, the respondents contend that it should not be enforced.Three relevant issues arise.The first issue is whether any finding as to a profit shortfall or otherwise can be made in the absence of the books and records of Forbes Australia for 1998, which books and records are no longer available.The second issue concerns the claim by the respondents that in fact the agreement of Mr Poh and Mr Forbes was based on a false assumption as to the value of sales which took place in 1997, but which in fact should have been accounted as having taken place in 1998.The third issue concerns the position of Mrs Forbes, which I will consider later in the judgment.Absence of source financial documentation The history of these proceedings reflects the steps taken by the respondents to obtain source financial documentation of Forbes Australia.It became clear prior to the trial of the substantive proceedings that the second applicant simply had not retained source financial documentation relating to its affairs in the 1998 and 1999 calendar years.Further, it appears that notwithstanding an order of this Court for third party discovery, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (which conducted an audit of the accounts of Forbes Australia for the calendar year ending 31 December 1999) did not have this documentation.I accept the submissions by the applicants that the respondents had not asked for source financial documentation until October 2006, which is after the seven year retention period in relation to the documents had elapsed.There is no suggestion that source documentation had been deliberately destroyed.In my view no adverse inferences can be drawn in relation to the absence of the relevant source financial documentation.The courts have recognised the importance of access to source financial documentation in the face of conflicting financial evidence (for example, Hamilhall Pty Ltd v AT Phillips Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1446 ; (1994) 54 FCR 173 , ALF No 12 Pty Ltd v Starkey [2006] QSC 297).However the fact that source financial documentation is not available does not mean that the Court is unable to make a determination on a question of financial position (for example, David Towney v Minister for Land &amp; Water Conservation for NSW [1997] FCA 656 , ALF No 12 Pty Ltd v Starkey [2006] QSC 297).In this case, notwithstanding that the books and records of Forbes Australia from the 1998 financial year are not available, the evidence is clear that Mr Poh and Mr Forbes, assisted by informed accounting advisors, agreed on 14 January 1999 that on available figures the profit shortfall for 1998 would be $127,284.I do not consider that the absence in these proceedings of the source financial documents of Forbes Australia from 1998 undermines the existence of that agreement or in any way gives rise to an abuse of process with respect to this aspect of the claim (an issue to which I will return later in the judgment).As to the lack of an audit for that period, I note that Mr Poh deposed in his affidavit affirmed 5 January 2008 as follows:  28.I refer to paragraphs 5 to 9 of my First Affidavit affirmed on 25 October 2005.Following what Mr Forbes had said during that meeting, I understood that there had been agreement between Mr Forbes and myself that the amount of the 1998 profit shortfall was $127,284 for the purposes of the Profit Guarantee.I expected that the shortfall would be made up by Mr Forbes in the manner described.Consequently, I did not arrange for Forbes Australia to have its accounts audited by the company auditor (Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) for the year ended 31 December 1998.Because I understood that there was an agreement as to the amount of the 1998 profit shortfall and expected it to be honoured, I considered the cost of an audit to be unnecessary. In my view this evidence is consistent with the fact that Mr Poh and Mr Forbes agreed as to the profit shortfall of Forbes Australia for 1998, leaving an audit unnecessary.Were Forbes Australia\\'s sales for 1998 actually understated by $240,866.42?Of greater concern is the possibility that information which came to the parties\\' attention after 1998 demonstrated that in fact the agreement of 14 January 1999 was based on inaccurate data.Mr Forbes in his affidavits deposes as to this belief --- in particular in paras 29-32 of his affidavit of 18 January 2008 wherein he deposes as follows:  29.I refer to paragraph 34 of Kiat\\'s 2nd Affidavit.In paragraph 35 of my First Affidavit, I say that I verily believe that the profit figure for the year ended 31 December 1998 exceeded the Profit Guarantee figure of $1.4 million by $151,156.00.My belief was based on calculations made by Forbes Australia\\'s staff that were provided to my (sic) early in 2000.The calculations were given to me in the form of a handwritten note, a true copy of which is Exhibit \"MF-9\" to this Affidavit.My recollection is that at or shortly after the time I received this note I referred them to Terry Brauer.  30.I have since been informed by Terry Brauer that he no longer holds the view that the 1998 sales were understated by the sum of $418,000.00 and that the credit notes issued by Forbes Australia at the direction of the First Applicant all appear valid to the extent that the sales recorded in the invoices to which the credit notes relate are recorded elsewhere.  31.I have since reviewed the relevant invoices and credit notes myself and say that:   (a) the sales recorded in invoices numbered 23701 and 23702 (both dated 29 January 1998) are the same as those recorded in invoices numbered 23217 to 23224 (all dated 20 November 1997) and 23451 and 23452 (both dated 8 December 1997);   (b) the credit notes issued in 1998 in respect of invoices numbered 23701 and 23702 should have been issued in respect of invoices numbered 23217 to 23224 inclusive and invoices numbered 23451 and 23452, because the sales were not actually made until 1998 as indicated in invoices numbered 23701 and 23702 (both dated 29 January 1998).  32.In the circumstances, Forbes Australia\\'s profit for the 1998 calendar year was understated by $240,866.42 (not $418,000.00 as I indicated in my First Affidavit) when account is taken of the fact that credit notes were issued, at the request of the First Applicant, in respect of sales that actually took place in 1998 rather than the end of 1997. Mr Forbes\\' evidence was supported by evidence of Mr Brauer who deposed that the understated profit for the 1998 was the result of the sale of various concrete mixers by Forbes Australia to the Asian subsidiaries of Teamsphere Ltd, and that following an examination of Forbes Australia\\'s accounts he discovered that these sales had been reversed and were not treated as income in the accounts of Forbes Australia (affidavit of Terrence Brauer affirmed 25 January 2006 para 32 and para 33).Indeed Mr Forbes in his affidavit deposed that sales in 1998 had been understated by $240,866.42, which is the sum total of the sales referred to in Invoices 21701 and 23702.Invoice 23702 refers to the same mixer serial numbers as those supplied pursuant to Invoice 23701, however Invoice 23702 is an invoice for the labour to assemble those mixers.These invoices are exhibited to the affidavit of Mr Brauer sworn 18 January 2008.However it became clear during cross-examination of Mr Forbes and Mr Brauer that the sales which the respondents claimed should have been credited to the 1998 year actually took place in 1997, and were properly accounted as 1997 sales, as claimed by the applicants.In fact, the sales which took place in 1997 were, as the applicants claimed, simply reinvoiced in 1998.I note in particular Counsel\\'s cross-examination of Mr Forbes (TS p 284 et seq) with respect to Invoice 21701, (dated 20 February 1998) which Invoice referred to the supply of ten hydraulic mixers and the serial numbers of mixers, and which on the face of the invoice totalled $140,000.As Mr Jones\\' cross-examination demonstrated, Invoice 23701, dated 20 February 1998, merely reflected sales that were invoiced and shipped in 1997.Further, I note that Mr Brauer conceded during cross-examination that the sales referred to in Invoice 23701 actually took place in 1997 (TS p 327 ll 21-24).Mr Poh deposed that the two invoices 23701 and 23702 were not actual sales but repeat billings for the sales made in November and December 1997, and the Credit Notes 485 and 549 exhibited on pp 36 and 37 of exhibit TB5 to Mr Brauer\\'s affidavit sworn 18 January 2006 were correctly issued to reverse those repeat billings.In my view this evidence correctly represents the position with respect to the sales referred to in those invoices.I note further that the expert evidence in relation to the existence (or otherwise) of a Forbes Australia profit shortfall for 1998 is conflicting and of marginal assistance.Expert evidence tendered by both parties was qualified by the absence of audited financial statements for 1998.The expert report prepared by Mr Blackwood for the applicants and dated 18 September 2006 calculated a profit shortfall for the year ended 31 December 1998 as either $195,397 or $171,096, depending on a number of variables.Mr Lytras in giving expert evidence for the respondents deposed that from the information available and given the multiple invoices, it was not possible for him to definitively determine the calendar year in which the sales of hydraulic mixers the subject of invoices 23701 and 23702 took place (affidavit of Elia Lytras affirmed 11 February 2008).However I consider that Mr Lytras\\' evidence in relation to this issue is of little value in light of the concessions made by both Mr Forbes and Mr Brauer during cross-examination.On this basis, contrary to evidence of Mr Forbes and affidavit evidence of Mr Brauer, I do not accept that that the profits of Forbes Australia were understated by $240,886.42 in 1998, or that the agreement of Mr Poh and Mr Forbes on 14 January 1999 as to the profit shortfall experienced by Forbes Australia in 1998 was based on inaccurate data.Conclusion The law is clear that contractual provisions in a guarantee are to be construed strictly, and, in relation to provisions for the benefit of the principal, contra proferentum : Ankar Pty Ltd v National Westminster Finance (Aust) Ltd [1987] HCA 15 ; (1987) 162 CLR 549 at 561; Apple Computer Australia Pty Ltd v Mekrizis [2003] NSWSC 126 at [127] .In relation to the 1998 profit shortfall however, it is clear that the fact and amount of a profit shortfall for 1998 were agreed, on an informed basis, by Mr Poh on behalf of both applicants and Mr Forbes.Failing other reasons which have been advanced by the respondents, and to which I shall turn shortly, in my view the amount of $127,284 represents the profit shortfall for the year ending 31 December 1998 for the purposes of cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement and is recoverable from Mr Forbes by the applicants pursuant to the Forbes Guarantee.2.What is the position of Mrs Forbes in relation to the 1998 profit shortfall?Notwithstanding any findings by the Court in relation to the position of Mr Forbes, the respondents deny that Mrs Forbes is bound to the agreed 1998 profit shortfall amount of $127,284 on the basis that she was not present during discussions about this issue.The respondents claim further that Mrs Forbes cannot be bound by any agreement of Mr Forbes to the 1998 profit shortfall amount because Mr Forbes had no authority to act on behalf of Mrs Forbes.This is because: Specifically, the respondents point to Mr Poh\\'s evidence as deposed in para 8 of his affidavit affirmed 25 October 2005 which is as follows:  I recall having a conversation at the meeting with Mr Forbes to the following effect:   Poh Kiat: \"Do you accept the figures by the accountants?\"   Mark Forbes: \"Yes.\"   Mr Forbes did not deny any responsibility for paying the 1998 profit shortfall.  Poh Kiat: \"When are you going to pay the shortfall?\"   Mark Forbes: \"I don\\'t have the cash available to pay the debt at this time.\"   Poh Kiat: \"Forbes Australia could raise a pre-payment of rent in its financial accounts in relation to Forbes Australia\\'s leases of its Brisbane premises [leased from Mark Forbes, Karen Forbes (the Second Respondent) and Forbes Screens Pty Ltd].The pre-payment of rent could be used to pay Forbes Australia\\'s rent on the leases of Lots 8 and 9 for the next seven months.\"   Mark Forbes: \"I can\\'t accept your proposal because I have separated from my wife [Karen Forbes] and do not know what property settlement will be made.\"   Poh Kiat: \"I will accept a repayment schedule from you setting out how the pre-payment of rent will be applied against rent as it becomes due.\"   By this arrangement I meant that only a portion of the rent falling due each month would be paid by application of the pre-payment of rent.  Mark Forbes: \"I accept that arrangement.But if Forbes Australia achieves a profit over and above the 1999 profit target, I will use my entitlement of 10% of that profit to pay the 1998 shortfall.\"   Poh Kiat: \"I accept your proposal.\"  Further, the respondents point to evidence of Mr Poh in his affidavit affirmed 5 February 2008 where Mr Poh deposed at para 28:  I expected that the shortfall would be made up by Mr Forbes in the manner described. The respondents submit that the effect of any such agreements between Mr Poh and Mr Forbes was that any obligation of Mrs Forbes in relation to the 1998 calendar year was replaced by an obligation upon Mr Forbes\\' alone to pay, by some form of gradual repayment over time, the sum of $127,284.The applicants submit that Mrs Forbes had allowed Mr Forbes to carry out all of the dealings in respect of these transactions, including the contractual negotiations, and in those circumstances she clothed him with ostensible authority to reach the agreed 1998 profit shortfall on her behalf.Consideration In my view the submissions of the respondents concerning the liability of Mrs Forbes for the agreed 1998 profit shortfall have merit.The Forbes Guarantee specifically referred to the profit guarantees in cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement and the formula in Annexure 1 to that agreement, both of which in turn referred to the machinery for calculating audited profits before tax.The agreement reached between Mr Poh and Mr Forbes as to the 1998 profit shortfall, clearly in substitution of the machinery of calculation provided in the share sale agreement, was a material alteration to the terms of the Forbes Guarantee with respect to the 1998 year.Mr Poh has submitted that it is binding, and, as I have already found, it is binding on Mr Forbes.The position is, however, different with respect to Mrs Forbes.It is not in dispute that Mrs Forbes was not present at the meeting of 14 January 1999 when the agreement as to the 1998 profit shortfall was reached by Mr Poh and Mr Forbes.Indeed in this case there is no evidence of any contact between either applicant and Mrs Forbes in relation to the agreed 1998 profit shortfall (or any other matter), and certainly no actual agreement.Principles of actual and ostensible authority in agency law are well-known.A succinct explanation was given by Diplock LJ in Freeman &amp; Lockyer v Buckhurst Park Properties (Mangal) Ltd [1964] 2 QB 480 at 502:  An \"actual\" authority is a legal relationship between principal and agent created by a consensual agreement to which they alone are parties.Its scope is to be ascertained by applying ordinary principles of construction of contracts, including any proper implications from the express words used, the usages of trade, or the course of business between the parties ...   An \"apparent\" or \"ostensible\" authority, on the other hand, is a legal relationship between the principal and the contractor created by a representation, made by the principal to the contractor, intended to be and in fact acted upon by the contractor, that the agent has authority to enter on behalf of the principal into a contract of a kind within the scope of the \"apparent\" authority, so as to render the principal liable to perform any obligations imposed upon him by such a contract.To the relationship so created the agent is a stranger.He need not be (although he generally is) aware of the existence of the representation but he must not purport to make the agreement as principal himself.The representation, when acted upon by the contractor by entering into a contract with the agent, operates as an estoppel, preventing the principal from asserting that he is not bound by the contract.It is irrelevant whether the agent had actual authority to enter into the contract.  We have already indicated that actual authority may be implied.It is, however, important to emphasise that the authority impliedly granted by the principal to the agent must be such as could be validly granted by express agreement. These principles represent the law in Australia ( Crabtree-Vickers Pty Ltd v Australian Direct Mail Advertising &amp; Addressing Co Pty Ltd [1975] HCA 49 ; (1975) 133 CLR 72 , Northside Developments Pty Ltd v Registrar-General [1990] HCA 32 ; (1990) 170 CLR 146 , Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35 ; [2004] 218 CLR 451).The applicants submit that Mrs Forbes had clothed Mr Forbes with authority to conclude such an agreement on her behalf.However the only evidence before the Court relevant to Mrs Forbes in the context of the meeting of 14 January 1999 and the agreement there reached is that the applicants were aware that Mr Forbes and Mrs Forbes had separated.In the absence of evidence to the contrary (of which there is none before me) such circumstances run counter to any claimed representation that Mr Forbes had authority to bind Mrs Forbes to an agreement with the applicants in any respect.Further, I agree with the respondents that the agreement concluded between Mr Poh and Mr Forbes in relation to the 1998 profit shortfall was couched only in terms of Mr Forbes\\' obligations.It is settled law that a surety will be discharged from his or her obligations where there is a fundamental alteration to the guaranteed obligations to which the surety has not consented: Ankar [1987] HCA 15 ; (1987) 162 CLR 549 , Wallace-Smith v Thiess Infraco (Swanston) Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 49 at [302] .As the majority said in Ankar (1987) 162 CLR 546 after discussing a number of English cases:  These statements of principle ... indicate that the principle is the by-product, not so much of the general law of contract, as of the special relationship between creditor and surety arising out of the suretyship contract upon which equity fastened to protect the surety when the creditor\\'s conduct affected the surety\\'s liability: Holme v Brunskill .According to the English cases, the principle applies so as to discharge the surety when conduct on the part of the creditor has the effect of altering the surety\\'s rights, unless the alteration is unsubstantial and not prejudicial to the surety.The rule does not permit the courts to inquire into the effect of the alteration.The consequence is that, to hold the surety to its bargain, the creditor must show that the nature of the alteration can be beneficial to the surety only or that by its nature it cannot in any circumstances increase the surety\\'s risk, e.g.a reduction in the debtor\\'s debt or in the interest payable by the surety.The mere possibility of detriment is enough to bring about the discharge of the surety.(at 559-560)  In Holme v Brunskill [1877] 3 QBD 495 Cotton LJ (Thesiger LJ concurring) said:  The true rule in my opinion is, that if there is any agreement between the principals with reference to the contract guaranteed, the surety ought to be consulted, and that if he has not consented to the alteration, although in cases where it is without inquiry evident that the alteration is unsubstantial, or that it cannot be otherwise than beneficial to the surety, the surety may not be discharged; yet, that if it is not self-evident that the alteration is unsubstantial, or one which cannot be prejudicial to the surety, the Court, will not, in an action against the surety, go into an inquiry as to the effect of the alteration, or allow the question, whether the surety is discharged or not, to be determined by the finding of a jury as to the materiality of the alteration or on the question whether it is to the prejudice of the surety, but will hold that in such a case the surety himself must be the sole judge whether or not he will consent to remain liable notwithstanding the alteration, and that if he has not so consented he will be discharged.(at 505-506)  In my view Mrs Forbes is not bound by the agreement reached by Mr Poh on behalf of the applicants and Mr Forbes in relation to the 1998 profit shortfall.Further, the substituted agreement with respect to the 1998 profit shortfall represented a material alteration to the calculation of that shortfall, the terms of the principal agreement and in particular the liability of the guarantors with respect to the amount guaranteed for the year ending 31 December 1998.It is not claimed, and there is no evidence, that this alteration in any way benefited Mrs Forbes.Accordingly, any liability of Mrs Forbes in relation to a profit shortfall for the calendar year ending 31 December 1998 pursuant to the Forbes Guarantee and cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement was discharged in light of the substituted agreement reached by Mr Poh and Mr Forbes in respect of that year, and to which she has not consented.3.Was the effect of clause 3.3 and Annexure 1 of the share sale agreement such that the production of audited figures for the 1999 financial year was conclusive evidence of those figures, consistent with the decision of the High Court in Dobbs v National Bank of Australasia Ltd [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643?In relation to the year ending 31 December 1999 the applicants submit that Forbes Australia recorded an audited loss before tax, calculated by reference to the Formula in Annexure 1 of the share sale agreement, of $341,284.00.This loss, recorded in Forbes Australia\\'s audited financial report for that year prepared by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, together with the failure of Forbes Australia to reach the guaranteed profit of $1,350,000 (being 90% of $1,500,000 in accordance with cl 3.3.3 of the share sale agreement as varied) resulted in Forbes Australia experiencing a profit shortfall for that year of $1,691,284.The applicants submit further that the fact that the loss was recorded following an audit in accordance with Annexure 1 of the share sale agreement means that it is conclusive evidence of that loss.The applicants refer to the decision of the High Court in Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 as authority for this proposition.The applicants\\' case in relation to the claimed 1999 shortfall was helpfully summarised by Counsel in closing submissions, as follows:  Mr Jones: Your Honour, the applicant\\'s case is very straight forward, and that is the terms of the share sale agreement, clause 3.3 says that the profit guarantee --- the amounts of the profit guarantee are to be referenced by the audited accounts.Now, in evidence is the only document which fits within that description.It\\'s the audit by Deloittes, the company auditors.They are the audited accounts.If they are not audited accounts, and if they are not audited accounts to which that clause refers, then, one may ask rhetorically what conceivably could possibly fit that description of audited accounts.There\\'s no suggestion, there\\'s no pleading that that audit report, those accounts are in any way were fraudulently prepared or are not what they say they are...There\\'s much complaint raised that, \"Oh, we can\\'t test it.\" That\\'s true to a point, insofar as that every single document which those auditors would have seen are no longer available, and there\\'s the evidence, particularly, that the correspondence between the instructing solicitors explain why that is, and, namely, that the company went into a period of administration for a period of time, and lost control of all of its records, and when it came out of administration it never got those --- all of those records back.And for some reason the accountants --- the administrators no longer have them, and unfortunately Deloittes no longer have everything either.Now, but it\\'s... And it\\'s a novel proposition put by the respondent that the plaintiff, in particular a company can\\'t rely on its own audited accounts, which is what we\\'re seeking to do.Now, if your Honour accepts that they are the audited accounts of the company for the period 31 December 1999, then, in our submission, that is the end of the story.They fit the description of the accounts referred to in the profit guarantee clause, and clearly on their face, they comply with the terms in the share sale agreement.My friend, in his submissions, put to your Honour that they don\\'t, they merely --- there\\'s a further step that needed to be done, and that hasn\\'t been done, is the effect of my friend\\'s submission.If you Honour will turn to exhibit 1A, at page 148, which is at the end of the audit report --- Deloittes audit report.There it is.  There it is.That\\'s the calculation in accordance with clause 3.3 of the share sale agreement.So the applicant has done all it can conceivably, in terms of establishing what the profit was or --- and rather the loss was, and what the profit shortfall was, in this case.And you have the subsequent to that report is the report of Ernst and Young which merely confirms the position of the Deloittes calculation.But your Honour need not, strictly speaking, rely on refer to it as the only report, because the Deloittes report is what it is, the audited reports of the company.(TS pp 391-392)  The respondents\\' case with respect to the claimed loss in the 1999 calendar year falls into three parts --- namely an attack on the applicants\\' interpretation of cl 3.3 as a matter of law, submissions with respect to the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report itself, and submissions as to the admissibility of the report.In relation to the applicants\\' interpretation of cl 3.3, the respondents submit that the applicants\\' claims with respect to the final and conclusive nature of an audit report allegedly produced in compliance with cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement are unsustainable in light of ordinary principles of interpretation applicable to commercial contracts because: Further submissions of the respondents with respect to the authority of the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report are in summary: The respondents submitted that, in light of these concerns with respect to the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report, it should be ruled inadmissible.Consideration Is the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report like a \"bankers certificate\"?It is not in contention that, following the resignation of Mr Forbes as chief executive officer of Forbes Australia, Mr Poh asked Mr Singh, the new chief executive officer of Forbes Australia, to ask Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu to prepare audited financial statements for the 1999 financial year (TS p 215), and that Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu did so.The applicants rely on that report as being final and conclusive evidence in relation to that aspect of their claim concerning the alleged profit shortfall for the year ending 31 December 1999.In Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 the bank brought an action against the appellant to recover the sum of &#8356;998 8s 7d pursuant to a guarantee signed by the appellant.So far as material the instrument of guarantee provided:  ...   8.A certificate signed by the manager or acting manager for the time being of your head office or of any other office of your bank at which the banking account of the customer shall for the time being be kept stating the balance of principal and interest due to you by the customer shall be conclusive evidence of the indebtedness at such date of the customer to you. The appellant in Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 submitted that the clause was invalid because it had the effect of ousting the jurisdiction of the Court and was therefore contrary to public policy.More specifically the appellant submitted that: In finding for the bank the majority of the High Court observed (at 651):  This clause does not purport to impose upon the bank the necessity of obtaining the certificate it describes.It is not a qualification of the undertaking to pay contained in the first clause.It does not make a certificate a condition precedent to recovery.The promise remains a promise to pay the amount owing; it does not become a promise to pay the amount owing if certified or a promise to pay only what is certified as owing.The bank could recover without the production of a certificate if, by ordinary legal evidence, it proved the actual indebtedness of the customer.But the clause, if valid, enables the bank by producing a certificate to dispense with such proof.It means that, for the purpose of fixing the liability of a surety, the customer\\'s indebtedness may be ascertained conclusively by a certificate.It was contended, however, for the appellant that, upon its true construction, the clause did not make the certificate conclusive of the legal existence of the debt but only of the amount.It is not easy to see how the amount can be certified unless the certifier forms some conclusion as to what items ought to be taken into account, and such a conclusion goes to the existence of the indebtedness....(T)he manifest object of the clause was to provide a ready means of establishing the existence and amount of the guaranteed debt and avoiding an inquiry upon legal evidence into the debits going to make up the indebtedness.The clause means what it says, that a certificate of the balance due to the bank by the customer shall be conclusive evidence of his indebtedness to (652) the bank...   Parties may contract with the intention of affecting their legal relations, but yet make the acquisition or rights under the contract dependent upon the arbitrament or discretionary judgment of an ascertained or ascertainable person. The majority then considered issues relevant to arbitration and concluded:  There are many familiar kinds of contracts containing provisions which make the certificate of some person, or the issue of some document, conclusive of some possible question.The most conspicuous example, perhaps, is the certificate of the engineer or architect under contracts for the execution of works or the construction of buildings.  For these reasons we think the certificate of the officer of the bank is conclusive upon the parties of the amount and existence of the customer\\'s indebtedness. The applicants contend that once audited financial statements are produced, not only does this satisfy the machinery of calculation prescribed in cl 3.3 and Annexure 1 to the share sale agreement, but that as Mr Jones contended during closing submissions, that is \"the end of the story\".However, after considering the submissions of both parties I have concluded that the applicants have not substantiated their case in relation to alleged profit shortfall for the 1999 calendar year based on the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report.Although there is force in the submission of the applicants to the effect that, if the audited financial statements for 1999 prepared by the auditors of Forbes Australia did not contain information as to \"audited profits before tax\" of that company as described in cl 3.3 and Annexure 1 of the share sale agreement, one indeed might ask what else in the circumstances of this case could conceivably fit that description, I am not persuaded that the reasoning in Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 applies in these circumstances for the following reasons.Construction of clause 3.3 As I have already observed, as a general proposition the law construes terms in guarantees contra proferentum in the surety\\'s favour.It is clear that the profit guarantee under cl 3.3 exists solely for the benefit of Forbes Asia.Such a clause should be strictly construed ( Je Maintiendrai Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1985) 38 SASR 70 at 71, Apple Computer [2003] NSWSC 126 at [127] , O\\'Donovan J &amp; Phillips J, The Modern Contract of Guarantee (4th ed, looseleaf) at 5.920).The legal principles emerging from Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 have been largely confined to circumstances where a banker\\'s certificate has been issued as to the amount of indebtedness of a debtor to the bank (for example Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 , Je Maintiendrai Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1985) 128 SASR 70, Campbell v National Australia Bank Ltd [1994] SASC 4526 , Equus Financial Services Limited v Sabri [1994] FCA 1331 , George Biritz v National Australia Bank Limited [1995] VSC 91 , Shomat v Rubenstein (1995) 124 FLR 284 , Thurwood v First for Finance Pty Ltd [1997] FCA 559 , Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking v Pan Foods Company Importers &amp; Distributors Pty Ltd [1998] VSC 346 , Jenkins v National Australia Bank Ltd [1999] VSCA 33 , State Bank v Lo [2000] NSWSC 1191 , State Bank of NSW v Kit Cheng Chia [2000] NSWSC 552 , Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v Dzienciol [2001] WASC 305 , Julong Pty Ltd v Fenn [2002] QCA 529 , Apple Computer [2003] NSWSC 126 , Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Bouwman [2003] WASC 205 , Timms v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2004] NSWSC 76 , Permanent Trustee Company Limited v Gulf Import and Export Company [2008] VSC 162).Since --- and possible because of --- Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 , bankers\\' certificates have become well-known in practice.That is not to say that the principle articulated in Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 has not been extended beyond the banker/customer/surety relationship, however circumstances in which the Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 principle is applicable are primarily confined to those involving the issue of a certificate as to the existence of a fact pursuant to legislation, or certain types of agreement, for example: As observed by McPherson J in Parker v QBSA [2000] QCA 422 at [13] , the provision concerning conclusiveness of certificate of title under the Torrens system of registration is perhaps the best known Australian legislative example of the issue of a certificate having a final effect.In this case it is clear that: Any clause which purports to specify how a particular issue will be determined so as to preclude the parties from subsequently ventilating that issue in court must be expressed in the clearest of terms ( Stylis v United Medical Protection Ltd [2007] NSWCA 109).Neither cl 3.3 (nor Annexure 1) clearly express such a limitation.While these provisions do purport to prescribe a method of calculation of profits, they do not purport to have the effect of finality as was the situation in many of the cases to which I have referred.In the absence of such language the Court will be loath to impute such an effect: Permanent Trustee Company Ltd v Gulf Import and Export Company &amp; Emirates Trading Agency LLC [2008] VSC 162 at [38] .The preparation of an audit opinion in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, while usually undertaken by experts, is clearly not a banker\\'s certificate as contemplated in Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 and the overwhelming majority of cases where the Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 principles have been applied.Nor, in my view, is it akin to a banker\\'s certificate, whereby a person nominated by the relevant bank certifies the existence of a fact appearing in bank records, namely the recorded amount of indebtedness of a customer to the bank.Further, in the sense that an audit report is produced, albeit in an expert fashion, but based upon information provided by the company itself, in my view it is not akin to a certificate given by an engineer, an architect or a builder, who certifies the existence of a state of affairs in relation to construction of a building which he or she has personal knowledge and control.Clause 3.3 can be contrasted with cll 3.4.2, 3.4.3 and 3.4.4 of the share sale agreement which do purport to prescribe certifications by third parties in a manner akin to cases where Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 has been applied.These clauses refer to the retention and subsequent payment of the \"Retention Sum\" by the vendors\\' solicitors as follows: ...  3.4.2 secondly, to the Company, such sum of money which represent the difference in the Net Tangible Asset (\"NTA\") of the Company represented by the Vendors under the Said Accountants (as hereinafter defined ) as at 30.6.97 namely A$1,611,432.00 and the actual NTA of the Company as certified by a firm of accountants appointed by the Purchaser in verifying the NTA of the Company as represented by the Vendors to the Purchaser;  3.4.3 thirdly, to the Company such sum of money which represent the loss and damages suffered by the Company as a result of FFT\\'s breach of FFT\\'s warranties, representations and covenant under the FEH/FFT Agreement upon the Vendors\\' Solicitor\\'s receipt of FEH\\'s auditor\\'s certification of such amount of loss and damages suffered by the Company;  3.4.4 fourthly, to the Company, such sum of money which represent the loss and damages suffered by FI as a result of FBT\\'s breach of FBT\\'s warranties, representations and covenants under the FIA/FIPL Agreement, upon the Vendors\\' Solicitor\\'s receipt of FEH\\'s auditor\\'s certification of such amount of loss and damages suffered by the Company.Clauses 3.4.2, 3.4.3 and 3.4.4 provide for conclusive certification by nominated persons of certain facts.Such language does not appear in cl 3.3.Significantly, cl 17 of the share sale agreement provides that \" any dispute in connection with the agreement should be finally settled by arbitration by an independent person appointed by the President for the time being of the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants (Queensland) at the request of either party\".This clause did not exclude disputes in respect of cl 3.3.The existence of cl 17 and the fact that it applies to all disputes militates against an interpretation that audited financial statements were to be a final and conclusive determination of the profits of Forbes Australia within the meaning of cl 3.3.Possible failure of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report to comply with Annexure 1 Even assuming that the effect of cl 3.3 and Annexure 1 is that an audit opinion is akin to a \"Dobbs\" certificate as submitted by the applicants, I do not accept that the position as to the audited profits before tax is so finally and conclusively determined by the tender of the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu audit report that the respondents are not permitted to challenge the findings of the report on the basis that it does not comply with Annexure 1, which provided the machinery of calculation adverted to in cl 3.3.The High Court in Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 accepted that a clause of this nature should not be interpreted as covering all grounds which go to the validity of the amount certified, for example illegality (at 651).Similarly, the Courts have found that a certificate can be challenged on such grounds as fraud and obvious error ( Permanent Trustee Company Limited v Gulf Import and Export Company [2008] VSC 162) , although if the certificate is properly tendered the onus falls upon the defendant to demonstrate by acceptable evidence that the certificate is incorrect ( Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Oberdan [2000] SASC 428 at [14] , Concrete Constructions Group Pty Ltd v Coddlestone Pty Ltd [1995] ACTSC 332).In this case cl 3.3 and Annexure 1 are not framed in such terms that an audit report is final and conclusive irrespective of any errors (whether manifest or otherwise) in calculations of the audited financial statements or failure of the audit report to comply with the prescribed formula in Annexure 1 (contrast for example State Bank of NSW v Chia [2000] NSWSC 552).Accordingly it could not be contended that the claimed profit shortfall of $1,691,284 as stated in the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report would be final and conclusive even if the respondents were able to demonstrate flaws in the calculations which arrived at that figure, including failure to comply with the prescribed formula in Annexure 1 or otherwise.The respondents submit that because of the absence of source financial documentation, they cannot test the accuracy of the report through cross-examination or other analysis.In light of this submission I note the following: The expert accounting evidence tendered during the proceedings suggests deficiencies attendant upon the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report; The expert report of Mr Angus Blackwood dated 18 September 2006 for the applicants is of minimal assistance in relation to the report because Mr Blackwood\\'s comments in relation to the 1999 profits are based upon the audited financial statements by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.Mr Elia Lytras, an expert witness for the respondents, deposed that in order to determine the audit profit shortfall or excess for Forbes Australia for the year ended 31 December 1999 he required copies of all the instructions, working papers and files of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu in relation to their audit of the Financial Reports of Forbes Australia (affidavit of Elia Lytras affirmed 18 January 2007).It is not in dispute that the documentation requested by Mr Lytras was not available.Mr Robert Edwards, a registered company auditor who gave expert evidence for the respondents, deposed that as at the date of his affidavit there was an absence of essential documentation necessary for him to prepare an audit of the accounts of Forbes Australia for 1999.More significantly, Mr Edwards deposed that the lack of essential documentation provided by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu in response to requests for information meant that he was unable to assess the quality of the 1999 audit of Forbes Australia undertaken by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (affidavit of Robert Edwards affirmed 21 September 2007).Annexure 1 requires that, in calculating the audited profit before tax of Forbes Australia and its subsidiaries, the following were to be excluded: extraordinary items; abnormal items; gain or loss on disposal and/or revaluation of assets; expenses relating to research and development; provisions for long service leave; additional depreciation and amortisation resulting from the value of any item.However as the respondents submitted, these were steps which were, in accordance with the formula, to be undertaken after the delivery of the audited accounts.The significance of these items is apparent from the undisputed evidence of Mr Lytras in his affidavits affirmed 11 September 2007 and 11 February 2008.In his affidavit affirmed 11 September 2007, Mr Lytras stated that Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu was unable to provide any data which explained a $1,068,399 variance in their audited figures from the management accounts for the year ended 31 December 1999.In a briefing note exhibited to his affidavit affirmed 11 February 2008 (exhibit 6), Mr Lytras stated that he believed that the variance arose due to a substantial and material write-down of trade debtors, accompanied by raising a significant bad debt provision, as at 31 December 1999.Mr Lytras also stated, inter alia , that: The material provided by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu contained no explanation for the reasons or basis for those write-downs or the additional bad debt provision --- accordingly it was not possible to form an opinion as to the reasonableness of the write-down.At least one of the debts written off was more than twelve months prior to 31 December 1999.The nature of the Favco Australia amounts written off were unclear.The write-down causing the variance accords with the definition of \"abnormals\", was of significant size and had a significant impact upon the entity\\'s trading performance for the subject period.In view of the lack of source financial documentation it was unclear whether the write-down was extraordinary.In summary, Mr Lytras\\' evidence was that the possible treatment of extraordinary and abnormal items potentially affected the 1999 calendar year profit result, as stated in the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report.In the absence of the source financial documentation, it is not possible to be confident that the accounts were produced in accordance with the Australian Accounting Standards or that the formula in Annexure 1 had been followed.In my view this evidence demonstrates that there are grounds for inferring either errors in the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report, or that the report does not comply with Annexure 1 of the share sale agreement.On this basis I do not consider that the audit statements in the report are reliable evidence of the profit position of Forbes Australia in the year ending 31 December 1999.Should the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report be ruled inadmissible?Finally, the respondents submit that the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report should be ruled inadmissible on the basis of both s 135 and s 136 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth).The applicants concede that, if I were to so rule, there is a cascading effect in relation to the report prepared by Ernst &amp; Young dated 4 October 2001 (exhibited to Mr Poh\\'s affidavit) based on the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Report, so that my decision in relation to the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report will determine the fate of the Ernst and Young document (TS p 26 ll 9-13).The Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Report is in the form of an expert opinion, however the applicants do not press for its admission on that basis.Rather, the applicants submit that it falls within the exception to the hearsay rule for business records in accordance with s 69 of the Evidence Act .To qualify as a business record the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report must satisfy the following criteria:  s 69.(1) ... a document that: (a) either: (i) is or forms part of the records belonging to or kept by a person, body or organisation in the course of, or for the purposes of, a business; or (ii) at any time was or formed part of such a record; and (b) contains a previous representation made or recorded in the document in the course of, or for the purposes of, the business. (2) The hearsay rule does not apply to the document (so far as it contains the representation) if the representation was made: (a) by a person who had or might reasonably be supposed to have had personal knowledge of the asserted fact; or (b) on the basis of information directly or indirectly supplied by a person who had or might reasonably be supposed to have had personal knowledge of the asserted fact. .... (5) For the purposes of this section, a person is taken to have had personal knowledge of a fact if the person\\'s knowledge of the fact was or might reasonably be supposed to have been based on what the person saw, heard or otherwise perceived (other than a previous representation made by a person about the fact).Note 1: Sections 48 , 49 , 50 , 146 , 147 and subsection 150(1) are relevant to the mode of proof, and authentication, of business records.  Note 2: Section 182 gives this section a wider application in relation to Commonwealth records. The purpose of the s 69 exception to the hearsay rule for business records was noted by Sperling J in Roach and Ors v Page and Ors (No 27) [2003] NSWSC 1046 at [11] :  The thinking behind the section is clear enough.Things recorded or communicated in the course of the business and constituting or concerning business activities are likely to be correct.There is good reason for the courts to afford to such records the same kind of reliability as those engaged in business operations customarily do.The same is not true of publications made for wider dissemination, for entertainment, for advertising or for public relations purposes.Such publications are justifiably received with healthy scepticism. Essentially business records are prepared as internal records in the course of or for the purposes of the business (Austin J in ASIC v Rich [2005] NSWSC 417 at [212] ).Business records can clearly include opinions ( Ringrow Pty Ltd v BP Australia Ltd [2003] FCA 933) however as observed by Austin J in ASIC v Rich [2005] NSWSC 417:  It is most unlikely that those expressing opinions in business records would attend to the requirements of s 78 or s 79 , let alone with the precision required by Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705.It would not occur to the people creating those documents that they should set out to justify their opinions in the same way that an expert would do in preparing a written report for a court hearing.In those circumstances, to apply the opinion rule to business records that meet the requirements of s 69 would be substantially to undermine, if not to negate, the implementation of the policy underlying the business records provisions, asserted so forcefully by Hope JA in Albrighton (at 548-549) and by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its Interim Report on Evidence at [709].Courts would be prevented from having access to substantial components of the records of businesses so as to assess them for what they are, on the ground that they do not satisfy requirements which their authors would not have regarded as relevant.As Brownie AJ remarked in a somewhat different context ( Linfox Transport (Aust) Pty Ltd v Arthur Yates &amp; Co Ltd (2003) 47 ACSR 261 at [23]), \"it does not seem apt in this context to draw a lawyerly distinction between the way a witness might or might not be permitted to give opinion evidence in court with the way in which a company officer routinely reports to his superiors\".(at [212])  While an expert audit report is clearly of a different character to \"routine business records\", in my view an auditor\\'s report on the financial position of the company can fall within the description of forming \"part of the records belonging to or kept by ... (an) organisation in the course of, or for the purposes of, a business\".I have noted the absence of witnesses capable of giving evidence as to the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report, and the lack of opportunity of the respondents to test the contents of the report.This is not, however, automatically fatal to the admissibility of a business record.As Heerey J observed in Guest v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 193 at [25] :  The terms of s 69(2)(a) do not suggest that it is an essential precondition of admissibility that the \"person\" in question be identified.The ordinary meaning of the language is that it is sufficient that the person who made the representation, whoever he or she is, had or might reasonably be supposed to have had, personal knowledge of the asserted fact.The policy behind the provision is clear enough.Routine business records, made before any legal proceeding arises or is contemplated (cf the exception in s 69(3)) , have an inherent likelihood of reliability which outweighs the common law\\'s aversion to hearsay evidence where the maker of a statement cannot be tested by cross-examination.The utility of s 69 would be greatly diminished if it were necessary to locate among large organisations, perhaps over a long period of time, persons who made representations, often in circumstances where the practical needs of the organisation did not require any identification at the time the representations were made. The absence of the author of the report, or anyone who could explain it, as a witness in these proceedings is, however, an issue which goes to weight to be attributed to the evidence: Ringrow [2003] FCA 933 at [27] .Although the Deloittes Touche Tohmatsu report may be a \"business record\" for the purposes of s 69 of the Evidence Act and prima facie admissible, a balance must be struck between the probative and prejudicial value of the report.Section 135 of the Evidence Act empowers the court to refuse to admit evidence its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might: (a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party; or (b) be misleading or confusing; or (c) cause or result in undue waste of time.In my view the prejudice likely to be suffered by the respondents from admission of the Deloittes Touche Tohmatsu report outweighs its probative value.I form this view because as I have already explained, I consider that the evidence discloses grounds for serious concern as to the compliance of the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu audit report with cl 3.3 and Annexure 1 of the share sale agreement.This issue is compounded by the absence of the author of the report, any witness who could speak to the report, and the absence of source financial documentation, all of which mean that the contents of the report cannot be properly tested by the respondents.Accordingly I consider the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report should be ruled inadmissible pursuant to s 135 of the Evidence Act .As I have also noted, the same fate applies to the Ernst &amp; Young report of 4 October 2001.Conclusion In light of these findings, it follows that the applicants have not substantiated their claim against the respondents with respect to the alleged profit shortfall for the year ending 31 December 1999.4.Was the change of control of Forbes Australia from the vendors to Forbes Asia an alteration in the factual substratum sufficient to discharge the respondents as guarantors?The respondents claim that, because of the alteration to the factual substratum brought about by the change in control of Forbes Australia\\'s operations, the respondents were discharged from any liability in respect of the profit guarantee within cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement and the side letters.In particular, the respondents point to cl 3.1 of the share sale agreement which provides as follows:  The Vendors hereby unequivocally admit and acknowledge that the Vendors being the only shareholders of the Company and who are entitled to appoint and appoint all the present directors of the Company are in control of and shall ensure that all covenants by the Vendors as regards causing the performance by the Company through the control of the present directors of the company can and shall be so effected by the Vendors. The respondents submit in summary that following the execution of the share sale agreement: In relation to this contention, the applicants submit in summary that: The respondents\\' reliance on cl 3.1 is misconceived because the clause manifestly relates to the position of the vendors at the time of sale.The clause cannot be reasonably construed in the manner sought, because once the vendors had sold their shares they inevitably lost their power to appoint the directors.Clause 3.6 makes it clear that it was never intended that the respondents would be entitled to appoint directors at will and exercise complete control after execution of the share sale agreement.Clause 3.6 provides: Without the prior written consent of the Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably be (sic) withheld), the Vendors shall not appoint any persons to hold the position as a director of the Company until the Completion Date and if the Purchaser shall so consent, to ensure that such person shall cause the Company to comply with the provisions herein and give effect to the purpose thereof.Additionally the Vendors shall ensure that the Company shall not change any of its mandate to operate the bank accounts of the Company or open new bank accounts without the written consent from the Purchaser if the mandate for such new accounts is not the same as that referred to in Clause 2.1.2.In any event Mr Forbes\\' employment contract gave him control of Forbes Australia to the exclusion of Mr Poh.Consideration Provision of profit guarantees in circumstances where the guarantor or related entities have no control over decisions impacting upon profit potentially places the guarantor at risk.This is not to say, however, that an agreement leading to this state of affairs is not enforceable by the principal.In relation to this issue I accept the submissions of the applicants.Clause 3.1 clearly related to the position of the vendors at the time of the share sale agreement.It is a warranty one would typically expect to find in an agreement of this nature.Further, as the applicants submit, the point of the share sale agreement was to transfer ownership of shares --- which generally carries with it the power to appoint directors --- from the vendors to Forbes Asia.It is not surprising therefore that Forbes Asia, as owner of the shares in Forbes Australia, should have appointed Mr Chan and Mr Lee to the board of Forbes Australia.Indeed as already observed, cl 3.6 --- which was another covenant of the vendors to the share sale agreement --- specifically prohibited the vendors of the shares appointing any person as a director of Forbes Australia after the execution of the share sale agreement without the prior written consent of Forbes Asia.If the respondents\\' construction of cl 3.1 was valid, the profit guarantee contained in cl 3.3 would always be meaningless because once the vendors had sold their shares they lost all power to appoint the directors of Forbes Australia.I do not accept the respondents\\' submission that they were discharged from any liability in respect of the profit guarantee within cl 3.3 of the share sale agreement because the vendors ceased to retain control over the board or indeed the company after execution of the share sale agreement.As an additional observation I note that pursuant to the Contract of Employment between Forbes Australia and Mr Forbes (pp 83-93 of exhibit PK1 to Poh\\'s affidavit affirmed 25 October 2005) dated 22 September 1997 (the same date as the share sale agreement) Mr Forbes was appointed chief executive officer of Forbes Australia.The Schedule to the agreement defined the Mr Forbes\\' duties as \"all operations of the company\" and gave Mr Forbes significant authority in respect of entering into contracts on behalf of the company, signing cheques on behalf of the company.Further, cl 6 of the share sale agreement specifically gave Mr Forbes control over expenses related to the formula for calculating the audited profit before tax of Forbes Australia, prescribed by cl 3.3 as the key determinant of the vendors\\' profit guarantee.Clearly Mr Forbes remained subject to control by the Board --- and to some extent the views of Mr Poh as managing director of the parent of Forbes Australia --- however on a daily basis Mr Forbes clearly continued to retain control over a significant aspect of the operations of Forbes Australia after the sale of shares in the company.In this light, and in addition to the views I have already expressed as to the respondents\\' claims concerning cl 3.1, I do not accept the respondents\\' contentions as to the justice of the case in respect of the vendors\\' liability for profit guarantees under cl 3.3 or the respondents liability in respect of those profit guarantees.Accordingly, I consider that this aspect of the respondents\\' defence fails.5.Did the third and fourth deeds of variation to the share sale agreement result in the discharge of the respondents as guarantors?In summary, the respondents submit: The applicants submit in summary: The third and fourth deeds of variation in no way touched on the profit guarantee.The respondents have adduced no evidence to show that the deeds fundamentally altered the obligations regarding the profits of Forbes Australia.Clause 4 of the Forbes Guarantee applies.The indemnity given by the respondents which the applicants seek to enforce in no way relates to the consideration paid or payable by Forbes Asia to the vendors.Consideration As I have already observed, a surety is discharged where there is a fundamental alteration to the guaranteed obligations to which the surety has not consented unless the alteration is unsubstantial and not prejudicial to the surety: Ankar [1987] HCA 15 ; (1987) 162 CLR 549 ; Wallace-Smith [2005] FCAFC 49.The parties to the third deed of variation executed on 16 February 1998 were Pearlbunch, Talrate and Forbes Asia.The primary amendment to the share sale agreement effected by this deed was in respect of cl 2.3 and the nature of the final cash injection under the share sale agreement.In summary, the final cash payment of $1,099,999 to the vendors was altered to $599,999 in cash and the balance by way of 1.8 million ordinary shares in Teamsphere Ltd. The parties to the fourth deed of variation executed on 23 March 1998 were Pearlbunch, Talrate, Forbes Asia and Mr Poh.This deed had the effect of altering new provisions inserted by the third deed of variation in respect of the final cash injection under the share sale agreement --- the 1.8 million ordinary shares in Teamsphere Ltd were amended to instead be 180,000 shares in Teamsphere Ltd. An examination of the deeds of variation indicates that there were numerous other amendments made to the share sale agreement, and upon which the respondents have elected not to rely, presumably on the basis that those other amendments were either unsubstantial or did not cause prejudice to the respondents.Although Mr Forbes was not personally a party to either deed of variation, I note that Mr Forbes was actually the sole director of both vendors who were parties to the deeds of variation.Presumably Mr Forbes had personal knowledge of the reasons for the variations to the share sale agreement, notwithstanding that he personally was not a party to them.In any event, the amendments to the share sale agreement in the third and fourth deeds of variation upon which the respondents rely relate only to the form of consideration payable by Forbes Asia to the vendors.In no way do these amendments impact upon the covenants of the vendors under the share sale agreement, which are guaranteed by the respondents.In no way do the amendments increase the liabilities of the vendors.In no way do the amendments impact upon the rights of the respondents as sureties.Further, and of particular relevance to these proceedings, in no way is it apparent that the alteration in the form of consideration payable to the vendors would impact upon the profits of Forbes Australia.I also note that, as submitted by the applicants, the claims of the respondents that the vendors would suffer prejudice --- whether actual or potential --- by being required to accept shares in Teamsphere Ltd rather than cash as part payment of the third instalment under the share sale agreement were not supported by any evidence whatsoever.The contentions of the respondents as to prejudice were, in my view, purely speculative and unsubstantiated.In summary, in my view the amendments upon which the respondents rely do not affect the suretys\\' rights.I am not satisfied that the amendments to the share sale agreement operated to discharge the obligations of the respondents as guarantors.The applicants also rely on cl 4 of the Forbes Guarantee, whereby the respondents covenanted as follows:  We hereby waive all our rights to defences available to in respect of the above guarantee and indemnity under the laws of Queensland, and shall pay to you on demand all monies, losses and damages and costs and expenses, suffered or incurred by you as a result of the Vendors\\' breach or failure to comply with the Vendors\\' obligations and covenants under the SS Agreement. In relation to cl 4 the respondents submit that: I agree with the respondents that any ambiguity in relation to cl 4 ought be resolved in their favour.Not likely do the Courts assume that a party to a contract gives up all defences available at law.However in my view the respondents\\' defence with respect to the variations to the share sale agreement are not assisted by their submissions in respect of cl 4.Unlike the situation as considered in Corumo Holdings (1991) 24 NSWLR 370 , variations to the share sale agreement in this case were not such as to impact on the obligations of the respondents.Prima facie , the respondents are bound by cl 4 of the Forbes Guarantee.6.Was the transaction resulting in the acquisition of Favco by Forbes Australia an alteration in the factual substratum sufficient to discharge the respondents as guarantors?In relation to this point the respondents submit in summary: The applicants submit in summary: The acquisition of Favco was Mr Forbes\\' idea alone.The evidence of Mr Poh, which Mr Forbes did not dispute in his evidence in chief, was that Mr Poh expressly told Mr Forbes that it was his (that is, Mr Forbes\\') decision.Mr Forbes, as chief executive officer, had exclusive control over such expenses of the company.The acquisition of Favco, being Mr Forbes\\' own decision, cannot alleviate him of his responsibility under the profit guarantee.Consideration In my opinion the submissions of the respondent in respect of this aspect of their Defence cannot be substantiated.I form this view for the following reasons.First, the acquisition of Favco by Forbes Australia was clearly the result of decisions made in the course of management of Forbes Australia.The managing director and chief executive officer at the time of the acquisition was Mr Forbes.During cross-examination, Mr Forbes gave evidence to the effect that the decision to acquire Favco was that of Mr Poh:  The truth is it was in the prospectus and the Teamsphere release that Forbes Australia expand throughout Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, and Darwin.Now, it was Poh Kiat\\'s plan, and it would certainly never be my plan if I owned Forbes Engineering myself, prior to the takeover, I would never be buying Favco because I wouldn\\'t have had the funds to do so.  Okay?---Nor the manpower.  All right.That\\'s what you say; that\\'s your evidence?---That\\'s what I\\'m saying.(TS p 312 ll 1-9)  However Mr Poh\\'s evidence-in-chief was as follows:  [38] In or about October 1998, Mr Forbes telephoned and subsequently wrote to me regarding a proposal to purchase the various assets of Favco (Australia) Pty Ltd (\"Favco\"), a competitor of Forbes Australia operating out of Wetherill Park, Sydney.Under the proposal, Forbes Australia was to purchase certain fixed assets and manufacturing facilities of Favco in Wetherill Park, and in return, Favco would purchase from Forbes Australia certain quantity of completed units of concrete mixers and batching plants to set-off the purchase consideration of Favco\\'s assets.The purchase of Favco was strongly recommended by Mr Forbes.I recall saying to Mr Forbes words of the following effect:  Poh Kiat: \"The decision to purchase Favco rests on you as you are the managing director of Forbes Australia, and especially because you are a guarantor on the profit guarantees.I am therefore not in a position to influence your decision.\"   [39] The purchase of Favco\\'s certain fixed assets were concluded in February 1999.A copy of the memorandum I received from Mr Forbes regarding the terms of the deal with Favco is at Exhibit PK2 at pages 116 to 121. An examination of the documents at pp 116-121 of exhibit PK2 to Mr Poh\\'s affidavit affirmed 15 March 2006 shows that they appear as follows: In my view the proper inferences to be drawn from the evidence before the Court is as follows: Accordingly I consider that the acquisition of Favco, having Mr Forbes\\' concurrence if not the result of his own decision as chief executive officer, cannot alleviate him of his responsibility under the profit guarantee.Second, in any event I consider the facts that the profit forecasts which formed the framework for negotiations and discussions in relation to the profit guarantee related only to the Brisbane-based business of Forbes Australia, and that there was no suggestion prior to 22 September 1997 that Forbes would undergo any radical expansion in its operations, are of no moment in relation to the liabilities of the respondents as guarantors.I take this view because I consider that the acquisition of Favco in the circumstances I have outlined was actually, to paraphrase comments of Phillips J in City of London v New Hampshire Insurance Company (unreported, Phillips J Queens Bench Division (Commercial Court) 18 January 1991), discussed in Butterworth\\'s Journal of International Banking and Financial Law , March 1991, pp 144-5 and cited in Duffy Bros Fruit Market (Campbelltown) v Gumland Property Holdings Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 7 at [220] ) an event \"arising out of a contemplated course of dealing\" and as such it remained within the scope of the guarantee.No provision of the share sale agreement or the guarantees signed by the respondents limited the activities of Forbes Australia following execution of the share sale agreement.The expansion of the business of Forbes Australia under the control of Mr Forbes as chief executive officer by the acquisition of Favco was not an event which could be considered as outside the terms of either the share sale agreement or the relevant guarantees.There was no covenant in any relevant agreement that, for example, Forbes Australia would continue to operate a business based only in Brisbane (contrast for example Spencer, Turner and Boldero v Lotz (1916) 32 TLR 373 where the Court held that the intention of the parties was that the guarantee should only be in respect of goods supplied in a certain location and not otherwise).Third, even if contrary to my view as to the weight of evidence before the Court the acquisition of Favco was not the decision of Mr Forbes, the acquisition of Favco was not an event which caused a material variation to the terms of the share sale agreement: Ankar [1987] HCA 15 ; (1987) 162 CLR 549 at 559.It could not be said, for example, that the acquisition of Favco involved conduct on the part of the creditor (Forbes Asia) having the effect of altering the suretys\\' rights: Ankar [1987] HCA 15 ; (1987) 162 CLR 549 at 559.Finally, the respondents cannot point to any provision in the terms of the guarantee side letters as executed by the respondents which support the proposition that the acquisition of Favco involved a departure from the terms as agreed in the guarantee.In this respect the events of which the respondents complain can be contrasted with, for example, the facts of Ankar [1987] HCA 15 ; (1987) 162 CLR 549 itself, where the High Court held that the surety had been discharged from liability because, inter alia : Accordingly, I consider that this aspect of the respondents\\' defence fails.7.Even if the vendors\\' profit guarantee as articulated in clause 3.3 of the share sale agreement is valid, are the applicants estopped from relying on it because of the alleged representations of Mr Poh as pleaded in paragraph 13 of the respondents\\' defence?In relation to this issue, the respondents submit in summary: The applicants submit in summary that: Mr Poh denies ever telling Mr Forbes that he would not call on the profit guarantees Even if there is a factual basis for the estoppel in relation to the alleged promise not to enforce the profit guarantees, the estoppel cannot be enforced by the respondents because cl 13 of the share sale agreement expressly provides that the written contract is the entire agreement and the estoppel is inconsistent with the clear and unambiguous terms of the guarantee.Consideration Mr Forbes deposed in his affidavit sworn 16 December 2005 that, at a meeting of 21-22 September 1997 during negotiations for the sale of shares in Forbes Australia, he walked out of the meeting and was chased by Mr Poh who had a private conversation with him.Mr Forbes deposed that Mr Poh said words to the effect that \"the profit guarantees would never be enforced by him and were just something that he needed to have in the documentation for the other directors of Teamsphere Ltd\" (para 15).He deposed further that at the conclusion of a meeting on 14 January 1999 he spoke with Mr Poh and said words to the following effect \"Your representation to me was that the profit guarantees would never be enforced\", in response to which Mr Poh agreed that he would not enforce the profit guarantees (para 22 and para 24).Finally, Mr Forbes deposed that after the release of the prospectus for Teamsphere Ltd on 27 March 1999, he attended a press conference in Singapore during which Mr Poh responded to a specific question from a member of the press in relation to Forbes Australia and the profit guarantees.He recalled that Mr Poh responded to the question with words to the effect that \"The profit guarantees are no longer relevant\" (para 28).In his affidavit affirmed 15 March 2006 Mr Poh denied that he had made any representations alleged by Mr Forbes, at either meetings with Mr Forbes or at the press conference.Mr Poh gave a different account of the events at the meeting of 21-22 September 1997, in which Mr Forbes did not walk out of the meeting, but rather Mr Poh approached Mr Forbes in the room to have a private discussion with him away from the professional advisers, and in which Mr Poh did not say that he would not enforce the profit guarantees.On the evidence before me I do not accept that Mr Poh gave an assurance to Mr Forbes that profit guarantees would never be enforced by him, as claimed by Mr Forbes.I form this view for the following reasons.First, Mr Poh was adamant during cross-examination that he had never promised not to enforce the profit guarantees.I was impressed by Mr Poh\\'s demeanour as a witness.Second, Mr Forbes deposed in his affidavit sworn 16 December 2005 at para 23 that, in relation to his failure to raise the issue of the promise not to enforce the guarantee with Mr Poh at the meeting of 14 January 1999, \"I did not raise my concern referred to in Paragraph 23 during the meeting due to MR KANG\\'S presence\".(I presume that the reference to para 23 should actually be a reference to para 22, where Mr Forbes deposed: At the conclusion of the meeting, I spoke to POH KIAT and said words to the following effect:  Your representation to me was that the profit guarantees would never be enforced.)  No explanation is given by Mr Forbes as to why he was unwilling to raise the representation allegedly given by Mr Poh in front of a third party in Mr Poh\\'s presence.One obvious inference which can be drawn from his reluctance is that Mr Forbes was not confident as to the veracity of any such alleged representation, and believed that Mr Poh would refute its existence.Third, as became clear during cross-examination, the only person Mr Forbes recalled telling about Mr Poh\\'s alleged representation was Mr Grant, on the basis that Mr Grant was \"more like a confidante, a trusted friend, a family friend, that I had had for years and years, and he\\'s been my solicitor, and I confided in him in most of the business dealings I had had\" (TS p 293 ll 38-40).Mr Grant\\'s evidence was that Mr Forbes told him during a break from negotiations for the terms of the share sale agreement that Mr Forbes had told him that Mr Poh had said Forbes Australia would never rely on the profit guarantees (affidavit of Steven Grant affirmed 23 January 2008 para 14).However even assuming that this communication did take place, Mr Forbes\\' --- and presumably Mr Grant\\'s --- apparent lack of confidence in the existence of this representation is reflected in the fact that no steps were taken to commit the representation to writing in any way, including reflected in any agreement between the parties.Notwithstanding this alleged representation, no provision was even made to qualify the right of Forbes Asia to enforce the profit guarantees.This is particularly important in light of the fact that cl 13 of the share sale agreement provides that the agreement was an entire agreement.Presumably Mr Grant as Mr Forbes\\' solicitor was aware of these issues.Fourth, Mr Brauer claimed during cross-examination that Mr Forbes had told him about Mr Poh\\'s promise after completion of the negotiations (TS p 325 ll 41-45) however it appears from both Mr Forbes\\' evidence-in-chief and his evidence under cross-examination that Mr Forbes had no such recollection.In my view Mr Brauer\\'s evidence is of no weight as evidence of the occurrence of the alleged representation by Mr Poh.Fifth, as became clear during cross-examination of Mr Forbes, Mr Forbes never mentioned the alleged promise of Mr Poh not to enforce the profit guarantees during board meetings of Forbes Australia when the profit guarantees were discussed (TS p 303 ll 14-18).Sixth, any alleged promise of Mr Poh not to enforce profit guarantees runs counter to the fact that the profit guarantees were clearly an important aspect of the sale of shares in Forbes Australia.The importance of the profit guarantees is reflected not only by cl 3.3 and Annexure 1 to the share sale agreement, but also by the provisions of the guarantees given by the respondents.Finally, the alleged representation of Mr Poh is inconsistent with Mr Poh\\'s concern that Mr Forbes comply with his guarantee obligations in relation to the 1998 profit shortfall.While on the evidence before me it appears that, in light of the launch of the Teamsphere Ltd IPO in early 1999, Mr Poh did not wish to publicise the existence of the 1998 Forbes Australia profit shortfall or the obligation of the respondents to make up that shortfall, relevant events including journal entries and reversal of journal entries which I have already described in my view make it clear that the obligation of the respondents in relation to the 1998 profit shortfall was never waived by the applicants.This aspect of the respondents\\' defence is not substantiated on the evidence.8.Was the applicants\\' cause of action statute barred?The respondents claimed in defence of the applicants\\' entire claim that the applicants\\' cause of action arose more than six years prior to the commencement of the claim and is therefore statute barred.This aspect of the defence was not pressed at the hearing by the respondents.In my view it is clear that the respondents\\' claim in this respect is not substantiated, because: Accordingly, this aspect of the respondents\\' defence fails.9.Was the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee enforceable?The terms of the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee are as follows:  Re: (1) Lease of all that piece of land held under Title Reference 17447194 for Lot 8 on RP 229240 in the County of Stanley, Parish of Toombul, Queensland, Australia (\"Land\") by us to FEH pursuant to a Lease Agreement dated 22 September 1997 (\"Lease\") which Land represent the land whereupon the main factory and offices of FEH is located.____________________________________________________________________   In consideration of your agreeing to enter into the Lease with us at our requests, we hereby agree that we are obligated to you to effect the adjustments of Rent and/or the monthly instalments of the Rent as provided in paragraphs 3.1 to 3.3 of our above letter to Forbes Engineering (Asia) Pte Ltd and you are entitled to make such adjustments in your payment of rent to us.In the event that under such adjustments we are required to refund to you such portion of the rent as have been paid by you to us, we shall pay to you on demand such refund of rent in full immediately.If we shall have defaulted in such refund, without prejudice to your rights against us for our said default, we shall pay interest at the rate provided under Clause 6.8 of the Lease on such refund calculated from the date of our receipt of your demand until the date of actual payment of such refund.  Dated: 22 September 1997. The document was addressed to Forbes Australia, and signed by Mr Forbes and Mrs Forbes in the presence of witnesses.It is not in dispute that Mr Forbes and Mrs Forbes entered into a lease of Lot 8 with Forbes Australia on 17 September 1997.The respondents admit the existence of the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee, but deny that the respondents incurred any liability to the applicant under the agreement.As the purported consideration for the agreement was the respondents\\' agreement to enter into the Lot 8 Lease --- a past event --- the respondents also plead that the agreement is not supported by valid consideration.Further, the respondents contend: It does not appear that the applicants rely upon the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee in relation to their claim in relation to either the alleged 1998 profit shortfall or the alleged 1999 profit shortfall; and In any event, it is plain that only past consideration was given in relation to the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee, rendering it unenforceable.Consideration The applicants plead the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee in both the Amended Statement of Claim and the Reply.Paragraph 13 and para 14 of the Amended Statement of Claim provides:  13.On or about 22 September 1997 Mark Forbes and Karen Forbes entered into a written agreement with Forbes Australia in respect of the Lot 8 Lease (the \"Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee\")   Particulars  Agreement dated 22 September 1997 (also known as \"Lot 8 side letter 2\")   14.The Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee included the following express terms:  (a) Mark Forbes and Karen Forbes were obligated to Forbes Australia to effect the adjustments of rent as provided in clauses 3.1 and 3.3 of the Forbes Guarantee; and  (b) In the event that Mark Forbes and Karen Forbes are required to refund to Forbes Australia such portion of the rent as has been paid, Mark Forbes and Karen Forbes shall pay to Forbes Australia on demand such refund of rent in full immediately.In relation to the respondents\\' contention with respect to lack of consideration, the applicants plead in para 1 of the Reply:  (a) Forbes Australia expected that the Respondents would be bound by the terms of the Lot 8 Lease Guarantee.  Particulars  The basis for the expectation are the facts pleaded at paragraphs 13 and 14 of the Amended Statement of Claim   (b) The Respondents induced Forbes Australia\\'s expectation pleaded at paragraph 1(a) above.  Particulars  The Plaintiff repeats paragraphs 13 and 14 of the Amended Statement of Claim   (c) In reliance on the expectation pleaded at paragraph 1 (a) above Forbes Australia did not insist on the Lot 8 Lease Guarantee being in the form of a Deed   (d) In the circumstances the Respondents knew and intended that Forbes Australia would rely on the Lot 8 Lease Guarantee   (e) Forbes Australia will suffer detriment if the Respondents do not honour the terms of the Lot 8 Lease Guarantee.  Particulars  Forbes Australia will be unable to recover the rent paid to the Respondents   (f) The Respondents have failed to avoid the detriment to Forbes Australia by refusing or failing to honour the terms of the Lot 8 Lease Guarantee.  (g) In the circumstances pleaded at paragraphs 1 (a) to (f) above the Respondents are estopped from relying on the defence pleaded. The respondents are in error in submitting that the applicants do not rely upon the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee in relation to their claim in relation to either the alleged 1998 profit shortfall or the alleged 1999 profit shortfall.In para 30 of the amended statement of claim, the applicants plead:  In breach of the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee:   (a) Mark Forbes and Karen Forbes failed to refund to Forbes Australia in respect of the Lot 8 Lease:  i.For the year ending 31 December 1999 - $127,284.00; ii.For the year ending 31 December 2000 - $138,690.16 (being all of the rent paid in that year).As I have already found, a journal entry was made in the books of Forbes Australia whereby the agreed profit shortfall for 1998 was treated as a pre-payment of Forbes Australia\\'s rent in respect of the Lot 8 Lease (presumably in accordance with the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee) but this journal entry was subsequently reversed on 30 June 1999.The evidence is clear that Forbes Australia continued to pay the respondents rent in 1999 notwithstanding the agreed existence of the 1998 profit shortfall and the terms of the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee, and that the respondents did not refund the rent notwithstanding the agreed 1998 profit shortfall.It does not appear to be in contention that Forbes Australia paid the respondents rent in 2000 in the amount of $138,690.16 although having made this observation I note that the applicants claim no relief referable to the year ending 31 December 2000.The applicants plead that, by reason of the alleged breaches of both the Forbes Guarantee and the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee, both applicants suffered loss and damage (amended statement of claim para 31 and para 32).It is clear that the amounts in respect of loss and damage which the applicants claim arise from the breaches of the Forbes Guarantee and the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee are alternative, not cumulative.Accordingly, I do not accept the respondents\\' contention that the applicants do not rely on the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee in relation to their claims (although clearly more reliance is placed on the terms of the Forbes Guarantee).Of more substance is the claim by the respondents that, because the nominated consideration for the respondents entering the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee was the previous agreement of Forbes Australia to enter into the Lot 8 Lease with the respondents, the consideration for this agreement is past consideration and invalid.Of particular moment is the fact that the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee is not in the form of a deed, where consideration would have been unnecessary ( Morley v Boothby [1825] EngR 575 ; (1825) 3 Bing 107 ; 130 ER 455).It is trite law that past consideration is no consideration ( Eastwood v Kenyon [1840] EngR 80 ; (1840) 11 A &amp; E 438 , 113 ER 482 , Roscorla v Thomas [1842] EngR 70 ; (1842) 3 QB 234 , 114 ER 496, and see the discussion in such learned texts as Chitty on Contracts (30th ed, Vol 1, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2008) at 270 et seq and Carter JW, Carter on Contract (Vol 1 looseleaf, Butterworths, 2002) at [06-230] et seq).However where the giving of the consideration and the making of the promise are substantially one transaction, the exact order of events is not decisive and the consideration is treated as executed consideration rather than past consideration (Carter JW, Carter on Contract (Vol 1 looseleaf, Butterworths, 2002) at [06-250], Chitty on Contracts (30th ed, Vol 1, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2008) at 271).So, for example, a contract to erect buildings on land and a contract to grant of lease of land were in fact one transaction, notwithstanding that the lease was not entered until the relevant buildings were completed: Westminster City Council v Duke of Westminster [1991] 4 All ER 136 , discussed in Chitty at 271).Further, executed consideration is good consideration in circumstances where an act is done at the request of the promisor, it is understood that payment would be made, and the payment is legally recoverable ( re Casey\\'s Patents [1892] 1 Ch 104 , Pao On v Lau Yiu Long [1979] UKPC 2 ; [1980] AC 614 at 629).In this case I consider that the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee is enforceable, for the following reasons: To the extent that the respondents claim that the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee is unenforceable I consider that the respondents\\' defence fails.10.The Notice of Motion filed 12 September 2007 On 12 September 2007 the respondents filed a notice of motion moving for the following orders:  1.An order pursuant to Order 20 rule 2 of the Federal Court Rules , or the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, that this proceeding be permanently stayed as an abuse of process.  2.Alternatively an order pursuant to s.135 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) that  2.1 pages 130 -192 of annexure \"PK1\" to the affidavit of Poh Kiat affirmed herein on 25 October 2005;  2.2 paragraphs 34 and 35 of, and pages 13-54 of annexure \"PK2\" to the affidavit of Poh Kiat affirmed herein on 15 March 2006;  2.3 the Expert Report dated 18 September 2006 prepared for the Applicants to be excluded from evidence admitted, or to be admitted, in this proceeding. 3.Alternatively an order pursuant to s.136 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) that the Applicants not be permitted to rely on representations of fact and expressions of opinion contained in:  3.1 pages 130 -192 of annexure \"PK1\" to the affidavit of Poh Kiat affirmed herein on 25 October 2005;  3.2 paragraphs 34 and 35 of, and pages 13-54 of annexure \"PK2\" to the affidavit of Poh Kiat affirmed herein on 15 March 2006;  3.3 the Expert Report dated 18 September 2006 prepared for the Applicants as evidence of the truth of the facts stated therein, or as evidence of any facts upon which opinions are stated therein. 4.An order that the Applicants pay the Respondents costs of and incidental to the Application   5.Such further or other order or direction as this Honourable Court deems necessary or appropriate. The notice of motion came before Tracey J on 26 September 2007 however his Honour ordered that the hearing of the notice of motion be adjourned to the trial of the substantive proceedings.Abuse of process As was clear from the respondents\\' submissions, their case for permanent stay of the proceedings was founded on the absence of the financial records of Forbes Australia for the 1998 and 1999 calendar years.In summary, the respondents claimed that these documents were critical to properly investigating: It was not in contention between the parties that the source financial documents were missing and unavailable.I have already considered this issue in detail.The respondents submit that: The orders sought by the respondents were pursuant to O 20 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules or the inherent jurisdiction of the Court.Prior to amendments on 25 July 2007 O 20 r 2 empowered the Court to permanently stay a proceeding where the proceeding was frivolous or vexatious or an abuse of process of the Court.Since that date O 20 r 2 has applied to proceedings commenced before 1 December 2005 and allows the Court to give summary judgment where the respondent to a proceeding has, inter alia , no defence to a claim or the defence discloses no answer to the claim .It is now s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) which allows the Court to give summary judgment against a party where, inter alia , the Court is satisfied that a party has no reasonable prospects in relation to their case.The notice of motion was filed on 12 September 2007 and is not couched in the language of O 20 r 2 following the amendment.However placing to one side apparent procedural irregularities with respect to the respondents\\' notice of motion and the basis of the order they seek, I find in any event that the respondents have not substantiated their claim that the applicants\\' claims were in any way an abuse of process.As Dixon J observed in Cox v Journeaux (No 2) [1935] HCA 48 ; (1935) 52 CLR 713 at 720, the jurisdiction of the Court to stay an action as vexatious is to be exercised only when the action is clearly without foundation and when to allow it to proceed would impose a hardship upon the respondents which could be avoided without risk of injustice to the applicant.His Honour also said that a litigant is entitled to submit a claim for determination notwithstanding that its foundation may be slender; and  It is only when to permit it to proceed would amount to an abuse of jurisdiction, or would clearly inflict unnecessary injustice upon the opposite party that a suit should be stopped.(at 720)  Abuses of procedure usually fall into one of three categories: In these proceedings, in summary: In relation to the alleged profit shortfall for the year ending 31 December 1998 an agreement was reached by Mr Poh on behalf of the applicants and Mr Forbes as to the agreed profit shortfall.The absence of source financial documentation was, as I have already found, irrelevant in relation to the validity and enforcement of that agreement.In relation to the alleged profit shortfall for the year ending 31 December 1999, while I consider that the absence of source financial documentation was a key issue for reasons I have already explained, I do not consider that the applicants\\' claim with respect to alleged profit shortfall for that year was in any fashion an abuse of process.The applicants pleaded, inter alia , that the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report satisfied the requirements of cl 3.3 and Annexure 1 of the share sale agreement akin to a certificate as discussed in Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643.In my view this was a legitimate claim, notwithstanding that this aspect of the applicants\\' claim was unsuccessful.Admissibility of documents and section 135 and section 136 of the Evidence Act  The respondents have also sought exclusion of the material in: In relation to these documents: For the reasons I gave earlier in this judgment, the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report is inadmissible.It follows that the Ernst &amp; Young report dated 4 October 2001 and the letter from Freehills on behalf of the applicants to Mr Grant dated 6 April 2001 are also inadmissible pursuant to s 135 of the Evidence Act .In the interests of completeness however I note that even had I not considered the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu report inadmissible in accordance with s 135 I would have made such an order in respect of the Ernst &amp; Young report dated 4 October 2001 on the basis that: While there is evidence that the original instructions from Mr Poh to Ernst &amp; Young to prepare to the report were given in 2000 (and possibly prior to contemplation of litigation), evidence also demonstrates that 19 months passed before the report was delivered to the applicants during which time letters had been exchanged between the legal representatives of the parties.Further, in the covering letter dated 4 October 2001 from Ernst &amp; Young to Mr Poh delivering the report, the author notes \"... the procedures were performed solely to assist you in determining the quantum and importance of certain financial issues to be raised with the previous Managing Director, Mr Mark Forbes\".I consider an inference can be drawn from the surrounding circumstances that the Ernst &amp; Young report was \"a document prepared for or obtained for the purpose of conducting, or for or in contemplation of or in connection with, a proceeding\" and accordingly excluded from the definition of \"business record\" by s 69(3)(a) of the Evidence Act .I do not consider that an order pursuant to either s 135 or s 136 of the Evidence Act should be made in relation to para 34 and para 35 of, and pp 13-54 of annexure \"PK2\" to, the affidavit of Poh Kiat affirmed herein on 15 March 2006.I take this view because: Mr Poh\\'s evidence directly answered evidence of Mr Forbes in his affidavit sworn 16 December 2005 and Mr Brauer in his affidavit sworn 25 January 2006.A letter from Marsh &amp; Partners to the directors of Forbes Group Australia dated 16 February 2000 and a letter from Marsh &amp; Partners to Mr Forbes dated 14 March 2000, both of which are exhibited to Mr Poh\\'s affidavit (and found within pp 13-54 of Annexure \"PK2\" to which the respondents object) are also exhibited to Mr Forbes\\' affidavit sworn 16 December 2005 as Annexure \"MF-4\".Accordingly, it is clear that the respondents were relying on some of the same material they now seek to impugn.The material is relevant to both the applicants\\' claims concerning the 1998 profit shortfall and the respondents\\' defence.I do not consider that an order pursuant to either s 135 or s 136 of the Evidence Act should be made in relation to Mr Blackwood\\'s expert report.In my view no grounds have been substantiated by the respondents\\' to support such an order.CONCLUSION  The application is successful in part.I consider that the applicants are entitled to recover the agreed 1998 profit shortfall under the share sale agreement and the Forbes Guarantee as damages from Mr Forbes, being the sum of $127,284.The applicants have also sought interest \"pursuant to a share sale agreement\" or pursuant to s 51A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).The parties have not directed my attention to any interest rate specified in the share sale agreement the subject of these proceedings.However s 51A of the Federal Court of Australia Act provides:  (1) In any proceedings for the recovery of any money (including any debt or damages or the value of any goods) in respect of a cause of action that arises after the commencement of this section, the Court or a Judge shall, upon application, unless good cause is shown to the contrary, either:  (a) order that there be included in the sum for which judgment is given interest at such rate as the Court or the Judge, as the case may be, thinks fit on the whole or any part of the money for the whole or any part of the period between the date when the cause of action arose and the date as of which judgment is entered; or  (b) without proceeding to calculate interest in accordance with paragraph (a), order that there be included in the sum for which judgment is given a lump sum in lieu of any such interest.The usual practice in the Federal Court is to adopt the rates of interest applied in the Supreme Court of the State in which the application is commenced unless there is evidence that the rates are penal or not commercial: GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 688 at [7] .The current rate of interest prescribed under s 48 of the Supreme Court Act 1995 (Qld) is 10% per annum.No submissions were made by the parties as to an appropriate rate of interest.I consider that the rate of interest of 10% per annum should be applied in respect of the sum of $127,284 to which the applicants are entitled from the date the applicants\\' cause of action arose.Accordingly, the appropriate orders are as follows: In relation to the amended application filed 31 March 2006: (a) the applicants are entitled to damages as against the first respondent for breach of the Forbes Guarantee and the Forbes Lot 8 Lease Guarantee in the amount of $127,284; (b) the first respondent is pay the applicants interest at the annual rate of 10% on the sum ordered to be paid in sub-paragraph 1(a) herein pursuant to section 51A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), to be calculated from the date the applicants\\' cause of action arose; (c) the application is otherwise dismissed.In relation to the notice of motion filed 12 September 2007: (a) pursuant to section 135 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) pages 130-192 of annexure \"PK1\" to the affidavit of Poh Kiat affirmed on 25 October 2005 are excluded from evidence admitted, or to be admitted, in this proceeding; (b) the notice of motion is otherwise dismissed.In view of the mixed outcome in the case I consider it appropriate to invite the parties to make submissions as to costs orders.Accordingly I also make the following directions: The applicants are to file and serve submissions as to costs, and copy them in electronic form to the associate, by 4.00 pm on 6 July 2009.The respondents are to file and serve submissions as to costs, and copy them in electronic form to the associate, by 4.00 pm on 20 July 2009.The applicants are to file and serve submissions as to costs in reply, and copy them in electronic form to the associate, by 4.00 pm on 27 July 2009.The issue of costs is to be decided on written submissions without the necessity for a hearing unless either party should contact my chambers and the other party by 4.00 pm on 30 July 2009 and request a hearing or unless the Court schedules a hearing to hear oral submissions.I certify that the preceding one hundred and eighty-eight (188) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier.Associate:  Dated: 22 June 2009  Counsel for the First and Second Applicants: Mr N Perram SC and Mr BL Jones   Solicitor for the First and Second Applicants: Jackson Lalic   Counsel for the First and Second Respondents: Mr R Bain QC and Mr PD Tucker   Solicitor for the First and Second Respondents: BCI Duells  Date of Hearing: 12, 13, 14 February 2008 and 15, 16 July 2008   Date of Judgment: 22 June 2009    AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback  URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2009/675.html   '\n",

There\\'s one in the baby carriage. - Freeze, FBI! FBI, freeze! Put the gun down! Put the guns down! - Take her. Take... - Got her. Clonsky, where are you hit? Where are you hit? In the vest. I\\'m... - Where? I\\'m all right. I\\'m all right. - Oh, my God. - It hurt like a mother. I know. But I got something that\\'s gonna make you feel a lot better. Here we go, 602-555-0199. What\\'s that? Miss Arizona\\'s number. - You couldn\\'t tell me earlier? - No. What do we got? I\\'m okay. Excuse me. Would you mind? Hart! Hart! - Sorry, sir. - Let\\'s not make a bad day worse. Sir... ...about the bank, I don\\'t know what happened. It was like my high school reunion, except these people liked me. I think we can all agree it didn\\'t go according to plan. Yes, sir. - But I wanna talk about something else. - Yes, sir. This is some fan mail we\\'ve gotten for you since the pageant. Letters, cards, chocolates. I\\'ll, uh, take the chocolates. \"Dear Miss Hart, I saw you on the pageant. The next night I was coming out of a party... ...when this horrible guy grabbed me in the parking lot. So I did your SING self-defense, and he totally backed off. I\\'ve gone through tough times lately, and you have no idea what it means... ...to feel like you can stand up for yourself again. I just wanted to say thank you and you look beautiful in your e... \" - Evening gown? - Evening gown. - She liked it? - Lori, Newark. Sir, you\\'re reading my mail. That\\'s a class-B misdemeanor. Hart, I\\'ve been getting five calls a day for you to be on talk shows. The Bureau\\'s had some bad publicity lately... ...and the director thinks you could be the new face of the FBI. Sir, I\\'m just a field agent. Most field agents don\\'t have the president call them to congratulate them. I can\\'t believe I hung up on him. I thought it was Clonsky. This is important, Hart. Go home, have a nice dinner... ...and think about it. Well... ...I could use a nice dinner, sir. I\\'ll think about it. Hart. Well, hello, Agent Matthews. No, I\\'m just putting the finishing touches on your chicken potpie. Yeah. I think I\\'m gonna make some man very, very happy someday. Listen, I wanna ask you something. Do you know if the Poconos are in New York or Pennsylvania? Because I cannot seem to get a clear answer on this. Because I was thinking that maybe this weekend... ...we could take a little drive down there, do a little exploring, do... Why, aren\\'t...? Why do you wanna talk tomorrow? Aren\\'t you gonna be here in 10 minutes? Oh, well, I thought we were moving at kind of a normal speed. I... Well, I don\\'t need any more space. I mean... You know, it\\'s not like I expect us to get married or anything, but I... Well, what is it? I mean, is it...? Is it the way I snort? I mean, because I don\\'t have to snort. Or is it the...? Is it the sex? Because... You know, I could... I could get a manual or something. Well, no. No, you don\\'t have to explain. No. No, you know what? You know what? I have to... I have to go. Don\\'t worry about dinner. I, um... Mrs. Flammenbaum next door invited me to a surprise... ...keg party. You know what? I have to go. Okay. Bye. - This is where the health plan kicks in. You ain\\'t kidding. Ooh! - Morning, sir. - Hey. I\\'d really like to talk to you for a minute, if I could. Hart, have you been crying? No. No. I don\\'t cry. I don\\'t even have tear ducts. Sam Fuller. Transferred in from Chicago last week... ...because of anger-management problems. Really? She seems like such a people person. I\\'ve given this a lot of thought... ...and given that going out on ops has become problematic in light of... ...the bank thing... Well, I have decided to become the new face of the FBI. I really wanna be there and support the Bureau... ...and be a positive role model for women. I feel like this is a great ti... Oh, yeah. No way you could\\'ve seen me standing there. Sorry. - You were saying? Hey! Yo! - How about a real \"sorry,\" huh? - Come again? - You heard me. - This is gonna be great. I said, how about a real \"sorry\"? You are about to feel some real pain if you don\\'t back off. Hey, you know what? Don\\'t talk to me about pain, sister. I invented pain. - No, you didn\\'t just call me sister. - That\\'s not... I don\\'t recall seeing a little, skinny-ass white girl at the table growing up. Hey! First of all, thank you for calling me skinny. - That was nice. - Second of all, what is your problem? And third of all, you better apologize to me or... - Make me! - I don\\'t make trash. Come on! - Come on. - Knock it off, Fuller. Take a shower. That\\'s right, take a shower. Walk away. - You lucky you still can walk! - You want more? Take a shower. Come here. Go on. That\\'s right, go on. Keep walking. Hart. You were saying? Oh. A positive role model for women, sir. Talk to someone before we schedule any appearances. Someone who? Someone who can help with presentation issues. Clothing, makeup, so forth. He comes highly recommended. I just went through a makeover for the pageant. I\\'m still getting hairspray off my butt. What? It prevents the bathing suit from riding up. Thank you. Sir, I just don\\'t wanna become FBI Barbie again. What\\'s your option? You can\\'t go in the field without putting yourself and agents in jeopardy. - That part of your life is over. - Sir, it can\\'t be. That\\'s all that I know how to do. That\\'s all that I have. You gotta make a choice. Sit at a desk pushing papers... ...or be out there boosting the Bureau\\'s image? Look, when you make up your mind, let me know. Rachel, did those transfer papers for Matthews come through? On your desk, sir. Sir, is Agent Matthews going someplace? Miami. He\\'s gonna be assistant SAC. Going to the top, that boy. Sir. Sorry. You know, I\\'ll meet whoever you want me to meet. Good. Oh, I hope she\\'s not a fatty. Joel Myers, Gracie Hart. Oh, yes. Yes. I can work with this. You will be my Mona Lisa, my Sistine Chapel. - I will find the sculpture in the stone. - Slow down, da Vinci. How do you feel about a pushup bra? How do you feel about a genital-shocking taser gun? Ooh. I\\'m open to it. Okay. Are you open to new experiences, like becoming the face of the FBI? - I did the pageant, I can do this. - That was three days. This is your life. That was teaching a dog a few new tricks. This is teaching a dog to become a butterfly. Not that you\\'re a dog. They generally have smoother hair. Look, just... You know, just tell me what you want me to do, and I\\'ll do it. - Rule number one, no hitting. - What? The face of the FBI uses her words, not her fists or a chair. Rule number two, chew with your mouth closed. - You don\\'t know how I eat. - You have ketchup stains all over you. How did they get there if they didn\\'t fall from an open orifice? I don\\'t know. Maybe I walked under a ketchup tree. Rule number three, no snorting. Why don\\'t you just take the list. And I truly believe you are capable of great class and style. And, may I say, I also recently went through a breakup. I didn\\'t go through a breakup. Puffy eyes, no sleep, irritable. And some of the other agents told me about it. But believe me, you do as I say, and you will make him regret it... ...because people care about people who care about themselves. - So it\\'s all in here? - No, it\\'s all in here. America wants a star. So you have to become a star. You have to dress and treat your friends like you\\'re a star. You have to treat yourself like a star. Before you know it... I know, I know. I\\'m a big star! Our next guest was the runner-up... ...at last year\\'s Miss United States pageant. We found out she was an FBI agent... ...on a mission to thwart an attack on the pageant. You can read about it in her new book... ...From Misdemeanors to Miss Congeniality. Here\\'s Agent Gracie Hart. Hi, Gracie. - Regis. Good to see you. - Joy. How are you? - What a great suit. - Thank you, and you look fabulous. - Thank you. - This is not how I picture an FBI agent. You don\\'t look anything like J. Edgar Hoover. Oh, really? Because this is his dress. - Listen, I watched the pageant... - I bet you did, Regis. Every year, actually. It\\'s embarrassing. My favorite part was the women\\'s self-defense thing, you know? Could you give us an encore? Actually, I don\\'t do that anymore. I have someone who does it for me. So, if I could, I\\'d like to bring out a little friend of mine, Agent Sam Fuller... ...who will be helping us with the demonstration. Here she is. So, Regis, if we could have you come over to the mat. Fuller. Stand right here with Fuller in front of you. - All right, Regis, grab her. - She looks angry. - Do I have to grab her? - Go ahead. She has no place else to be. Ladies, if you\\'ll please remember, the word is \"SING.\" - Solar plexus... ...instep... ...nose... ...and groin. - Not the groin! No! Very nice. Thank you, Agent Fuller. Come on, Regis, let\\'s get you up. Thanks, Gracie. And as a special treat for knocking my husband around... ...I have a little surprise for you. - Oh? I think you know these people. Here\\'s Cheryl Frazier, Miss United States... ...and Stan Fields, host of the pageant. It\\'s you! - I love your lipstick. - You do? Stila made it for me. They named it after me. It\\'s called Gracie. That makes sense. You did something to your hair. Just a couple of highlights. A couple? Okay, okay... ...Miss I\\'ll-Never-Grow-My-Bangs-Out- Because-It\\'ll-Make-My-Face-Too-Long. I feel we should all be sitting under dryers. That\\'s what happens when best friends get together. Wish we could have invited my best friend, Roger Coleman... ...but he got hit by a Goodwill truck last week. Really? Don\\'t we have a commercial coming up? Please. It\\'s so good to see you. It\\'s so good to see you. Gracie, I\\'m sorry to interrupt. We have another taping. Oh, Cheryl, Joel Myers, my stylist. Miss United States, a joy to meet you. This is my hair assistant, Janine. - A pleasure. - And on makeup and bass guitar, Pam. - Your Majesty. - And you\\'re having a bad crown day. Uh, excuse me, private conversation in progress. - Ticktock. - Okay. I\\'m sorry I haven\\'t called you. Don\\'t apologize. We\\'ll have plenty of time to talk once I\\'m de-queened. - Oh, that sounds painful. - Oh, I really miss you. - And Eric. - Oh, well... ...actually Eric and I aren\\'t Eric and I anymore. - What? Since when? - Oh, just 10 months. - Ten months? - Yeah, I didn\\'t wanna bother you. You\\'re busy, I\\'m busy. I didn\\'t wanna call and say, \"We broke up. \" It\\'s no big deal. Miss Hart? - Yes. My daughter would love your John Hancock. - What\\'s her name? Lauren. - Lauren. - So, what happened? Oh, I just had to end it because he was getting, you know, really clingy. Yeah, but I\\'m fine. I\\'m good. I\\'m great. We need to get to Live at 5 for a wrestling demonstration... ...then there\\'s a cocktail party at your publisher\\'s apartment. I could go for a little tanning time. You\\'re gonna go for a little unemployment time in two seconds. Fuller, could you be a sweetheart and get me a Starbucks? I am dying for an iced Venti Caramel Macchiato. Get yourself a little something too. Let me tell you when I\\'m gonna get you an iced Venti Caramel Macchiato. When they elect a black woman president... ...of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Okay. And if that happens, I\\'d also like one of those little muffins. Where would you like it? Fuller, I\\'m sensing a little subtle hostility, and I think we should talk about it. Fuller, you shouldn\\'t keep things bottled up. - Fuller! What is your problem? The problem is, I don\\'t like you. Why don\\'t you quit. I let you have this job as a favor to McDonald... ...because no one outside of the canine unit would work with you... ...because of your attitude problem. - You know what? I\\'m out of here. Wait. Are you still going to Starbucks? Go! No one beats my little bro! Let\\'s go, let\\'s go, pay up. Come on, pay up. Come on, who\\'s next? Let\\'s get the bets on the table because... - Yeah? - Is he there? Yeah, he\\'s here. - Well, has he got my money? Hold on, I\\'ll ask. Excuse me, Highlander, you owe Mr. Grant 500 bucks. You got it? Get lost. He says he doesn\\'t have it, Mr. Grant. Okay! Okay! He seems to have discovered some cash, Mr. Grant. Good. All right, I got another one for you boys. Who\\'s the mark? This is gonna be one for your scrapbook. Thank you very much. Your name, please? Octavia. Octavia. I was wondering if you could tell me... ...what skin-care regimen you use. I like to catch as many felons as possible. It gets the heart pumping... ...and the increased circulation really helps my complexion. - There you go. Thank you very much. - Thank you. Hey. - Hey. Your name, please? - Priscilla. Priscilla. I have to do a book report. And I wanna do it on your book because I wanna be an agent too. Oh, well, good for you. Thank you, Priscilla. - Hi. Your name is? Angela. The other kids are doing their report on Beyonc� or Britney... ...but if you come to my school and talk, they\\'d see why being an agent is cool... ...and stop getting on me. - I would really love to... ...but as you can see, the agency\\'s got me pretty busy. There you go. Thank you. What you could do is pull your hair up. It would really open up your face... ...because remember, people care about people who care about themselves. - Okay. - Hi. Your name is? Jason. - Jason. If you change your mind, it\\'s P.S. 31, Priscilla, Miss Gordon\\'s class. Got it. Thank you very much. Your name, please? James. - Wait! You\\'re not writing it down! Bureau training. I can retain enormous amounts of information. P.S. 31, Priscilla, Miss Gordon\\'s class. See? And don\\'t forget the hair tip. Try some bows. There you go. Thanks. - Nice to meet you. - You too. And sorry to hear what happened to Miss United States. What happened? Cheryl Frazier was last seen outside this Las Vegas senior-citizen home... ...accompanied by longtime pageant host, Stan Fields. The two were walking to a limo after a goodwill mission... ...visiting the residents here. Apparently, Miss United States and emcee Fields were forced into a truck... Are they hurt? Are they alive? What demands have been made? That\\'s all we know. You\\'ll find out more when you get to Vegas. - Vegas? - They want you to handle publicity. Public sees you on TV, they\\'ll feel reassured. Absolutely, whatever I can do to help. Get your beauty team assembled. The jet leaves at 0800. I want you to have a bodyguard out of New York. They\\'re strapped in Vegas. - Sir, why do I need a bodyguard? - Crowd control. You\\'re gonna be the hottest celebrity in Vegas. - Really? - Assuming Wayne Newton isn\\'t in town. Oh, of course, sir. \"Danke Schoen. \" Fuller! I want you on a plane to Vegas with Hart. She\\'s gonna do publicity on the Cheryl Frazier kidnapping. Not going. - Did you just refuse an order? - I can\\'t take her, sir. I\\'ll kill her. And I\\'ll enjoy it. Fuller, you are this close to being gone. Nobody wants to work with you in Chicago or here. That\\'s fine by me. I like to work alone. Then become a lighthouse keeper. This is the FBI. We like partners. She\\'s a pain in the ass. She\\'s conceited and... Keep people off her. Keep her safe. Be a good bodyguard, I\\'ll find you a partner. You blow this, you\\'re gone. Period. And by the way, I loved you both on Regis. - Grant. - Boys. Mr. Grant. Let\\'s see what you got for me. Stan Fields and... Miss United States. You know what the pageant will pay to get her back? Millions. - So we hold her for ransom? - No. I hold her for ransom, and you get a taste. Bring her to my car. I\\'m a little bit hungry. Hey! We grabbed her. Moron, you can\\'t handle this job. The feds will come right down on you. Don\\'t call me a moron. I got a BA in Fine Arts, and my brother... - Don\\'t call me a moron. - You were unemployed when I found you. You couldn\\'t keep a job on the show in the Strip. I made that show! It was my concept. Then suddenly they change it and tell me and Lou we\\'re not up to their standards. Get over it. You work for me now. - Lou. - I\\'m there. Ah! Bring me back up! She\\'s yours! She\\'s all yours! Let me up! Let me up. Just let me up. Oh, God, let me up. Next time, he lets go. You guys are crazy! Now what? Now we do exactly what he said. We ransom her. Oh! Please be careful. My guns are in that Fendi. Thank you. Thank you. Please tell me you have tickets to see Cirque du Soleil. - I\\'m your bodyguard. - What? McDonald thinks we have a bond because of our performance on Regis... ...and TRL, Oprah, the Food Network. Oh, hey, we got some great recipes from that one. The lemon chicken? Tangy. Now, look, like all great teams, Hope and Crosby, Fred and Ginger... ...Outkast... ...the end must come... ...so bye-bye. Let me make this simple for you, Hart. McDonald gave me a mission... ...so that plane does not take off unless we\\'re both on it. Got it? You might consider a Tic Tac. Please... ...we\\'re trying to cooperate. Shut your mouth. - You can\\'t talk to her like that. - You trying to tell me what to do? - No, I\\'m just the emcee. I\\'ve heard you sing. Lucky I don\\'t shoot you now. Okay, let\\'s line this up. - And... - I don\\'t have my crown. - Who cares? - I care. - Fine. - Thousands of women... ...across America care. - Give her the crown. When in public, Miss United States always proudly wears her crown. Okay? All right, let\\'s go again. One, two, action. We\\'ve been kidnapped, and there\\'s two men here... ...who say they\\'re gonna kill us by Friday at midnight. But I don\\'t want anyone to pay them any money. - Cut! - That would be giving in to terrorism... Shh! ... and I\\'m Miss United States... Cut! ... and I stand for fairness, decency... ...and the American way! I said, cut! I\\'d be happy to say it if you\\'d like. I\\'ve done quite a bit of theater. I played lago in Twelfth Night. Put two more choppers up. Sir. - Gracie Hart. - Yes. - I\\'m Walter Collins. - Ah. Sir. I feel as though I\\'m in the presence of royalty. Oh, no, sir, I\\'m not queen, just runner-up. I would like to present to you Agent Sam Fuller. - Fuller. - Sir. - Joel Myers, Janine and Pam. - Joel, Janine, Pam. Why don\\'t we get you to the hotel while I give the agents a debriefing. Oh, that\\'s too bad. It\\'s been months since I\\'ve had a good debriefing. Although, I\\'m really more of a boxers man. Okay, wrong audience. Agent Hart, Agent Fuller, this is Agent Foreman. He\\'s your liaison. - You need anything, Jeff is your boy. Good. - Welcome to Las Vegas. - Thank you. When my girlfriend found out I would be working with you, she almost died. - Oh. Oh. - Yeah, she\\'s an agent too. She actually thought that I was gonna fall for you. - I said, \"Janet, there\\'s no way... \" - Foreman, we talked about this. Sorry, sir. Anyway, you\\'re obviously too old for me, so... Oh, good, well, that\\'s a load off. They make an appearance at a senior center for a program... ...where the elderly spend time with kids. Mr. Fields\\' mother is there. I think what you\\'re doing here... ...shows that different generations have so much to learn from each other. I mean, I know I learned a lot from my grandmother... ...specifically, how to kill a chicken. And even though it wasn\\'t something I enjoyed doing... ...I\\'ll never forget the sound of their death squawks. But if I had to kill a chicken, I\\'d know how. They finish their appearance. Head for the limo, where they\\'re attacked and kidnapped. We got this video from a surveillance camera. All we have is two hooded figures... ...the make of the truck and a fake license plate. We talked to the limo driver, but he says he didn\\'t see anything. And that\\'s it. These are your briefing folders. Hart, you have a press conference at your hotel at 0900 tomorrow morning. - Call me if there\\'s any questions. - Sir? - We have to find her. - I\\'ll find her. I know we\\'re on a tight schedule... ...but if you guys wanna see any shows, let me know. Janet can get us tickets. I don\\'t know how she does it, but she does it. She\\'s really great. Expert marksman. She bakes. Oh, almost forgot. Here are your coded ID cards. You\\'re gonna need these to get into the Bureau. And here are your earpieces. We\\'re... Thanks. We\\'re gonna be on frequency 1145. Sorry, that is not FBI issue. That\\'s a sweater that I bought for Janet for her birthday. And that\\'s the hat that goes with it. Argyle. She\\'s Scottish. Janet McCarren. Look, I\\'m sorry. I\\'m just really in love. Where\\'s the best place for me to throw up? Well, I am thrilled for you, Jeff. Because, unlike Agent Fuller, I, too, am carbon-based. The Venetian Hotel. Miss Hart! What a fantastic pleasure. I am Roberto Fenice, manager of the Venetian Hotel. - Oh, hello. - Your wish is my command. Oh, well, I wish you wouldn\\'t kiss my watch. It\\'s not water-resistant. Although it\\'s more action than I\\'ve had in months, so go ahead. - Miss Hart, you are delicious. - Mr. Fenice. Hi, I\\'m Agent Foreman. This is Agent Sam Fuller. - Oh, my gosh! It\\'s Gracie Hart! You\\'re kidding! Where? Right there! Gracie! Gracie! Hey! Grac... Fuller! Oh, my! - Fuller! All right, down! Down! Too much, too much, too much. Fuller, Fuller. Fuller, I don\\'t think you fully understand the concept of \"too much\"! Hey, McDonald told me to keep people off you. And I don\\'t think grandpa\\'s coming back. At least, not under his own power. Wow. Maybe we should\\'ve stayed at Treasure Island, huh? - Hmm. You don\\'t see that in Jersey. It\\'s the best. A ships sinks, and there\\'s all these scantily clad sailors around. - Makes me wanna join the Navy. - You are just what they\\'re looking for. Hey, Hart, you sure this suite is big enough for you? I can fit my entire room inside your steam shower. Feel free to move in there. Yeah, right. Right, let\\'s go over this schedule for tomorrow. Gracie? Yes. Gracie, there\\'s something about Cheryl on the TV. We just received what appears to be a ransom video... ...which was e-mailed to our studios a few hours ago... ...from an anonymous source. It was sent from an unknown location. We\\'ve been kidnapped. And there\\'s two men here... ...who say they\\'re going to kill us by Friday at midnight... ...unless they\\'re paid $5 million by the pageant. Once again, that\\'s $5 million by Friday at midnight. I can\\'t just sit here. I have to do something. I should just see... You should do exactly what you came here to do, Hart. Press conference at 9. Limos. Limos, limos, limos, limos. - Call for you, sir. Line two. - Thank you. - Collins. - Yes, sir, hi, this is Gracie Hart. I was looking at the visuals, and I noticed that the limousine... - We talked to the limo driver. - I realize that, but... We\\'ve got something on aerial, sir. Don\\'t worry about it. Get some rest. Have a nice conference. Okay. Thank you, Janet. Yeah, hi, is this Desert Limo Service? Yeah, I\\'m trying to locate one of your drivers. A Mr. Tom Abernathy. Hi, is Gracie Hart there, please? I have FBI Director Wilson on the line. We need to speak with her ASAP, please. Is Gracie Hart here? Gracie Hart? Is somebody calling for Gracie Hart? Yes, ma\\'am. I\\'m Gracie Hart. I recognize her! Gracie\\'s here! - Yes? - It\\'s FBI Director Wilson, ASAP. ASAP. - Director Wilson. Thank you. Hart here. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I\\'m on it. Thank you very much. Okay, sir, bye-bye. - Would you please sign this? - Oh, sure, I... - My mom loves you. - Aw... - And she does not love easily. I love you too, Gracie. - You\\'re fabulous. You\\'ve got such great... Thank you, guys, so much for your support. I\\'m here on business to talk to this man about the Miss United States kidnapping. - Mr. Abernathy? - Yeah? What did you do? He was driving the limousine that Cheryl Frazier and Stan Fields were in... ...the day they were kidnapped. I wanted to know why you parked so far away from the entrance of the home. Yeah, why would you do that? Why? So if I could show you something... Well, it\\'s not these. It\\'s not my badge. Well, what do you...? It\\'s my deployment schedule... ...and if you can look where it says \"tomorrow\\'s events. \" - Yeah, go ahead, read aloud. - \"Nine a. m. Press conference... ...at the Venetian\"? Speak up, we cannot hear you! He said, \"9 a. m. Press conference at the Venetian\"... ...where I will be in front of channels two, four... I mean, well, everybody\\'s invited. And I will probably have to say that Tom Abernathy is a suspect. Why are you doing this to me? Because I wanna find my friends. And because you are sweating in all three stress spots... ...that people routinely start sweating in before they undergo public humiliation. I had it on Letterman. Okay, everybody, I would love to stay and chat... ...but I have to go pick out my outfit for the press conference. - Oh, what time was that again? Nine! Thank you. Watch the news, I\\'ll do a little shout out. Thanks, Gracie. Hey! Hey! Hold up! Hold up. Wait. Okay. Somebody came up to me the day before. She offers me 200 bucks if I will park far away from the entrance at the home... ...and that\\'s it. That\\'s all I know. - She? What did she look like? - Oh, Miss Hart, would you mind? - Oh, I\\'m actually in a hurry. - Is it true you\\'re seeing Prince William? - Oh, I\\'m... We were just talking at a book party. He\\'s in love with me, but I hate castles. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hey. Let me explain something to you. - Okay. You didn\\'t do what was on the schedule, and I\\'m a schedule-type person. - Oh. - You missed the press conference. I went to the Bureau because I got a tip from the limo driver... ...who said somebody who looked like Dolly Parton... ...paid him not to park in front of the senior home. - Did you hear what you just said? - Yeah. Why did you go out without clearing it with me? Clearing it with you? Hey, I\\'ll bet no one\\'s had breakfast... I\\'m sorry, but I don\\'t work for you. Okay? You work for me, so... - No, you didn\\'t just say I work for you. - You work for me. - You work for me. Shut up. You work for me. - Shut up. Fuller, I don\\'t have the time for this, okay? Listen, why don\\'t we just get something... Okay, look. I am the face of the Bureau. You are here to help me be the face of the Bureau... ...which means you work for me. It\\'s no big... Look, Hart, I am your bodyguard. That means I need a body to guard! You hit me, which means I could bring you up on charges. If I could just bring myself up right now. Okay, look, I don\\'t work for you. You don\\'t work for me. We\\'re a team. Get it? As in \"I will kick your sorry ass if you don\\'t listen to me\" team. If you remember correctly, it was \"skinny ass. \" And, second of all, what is your problem, Fuller? Do you honestly feel it\\'s okay... ...to go around harassing people and bashing their faces in? Guess what. You will never make it in this Bureau... ...if you don\\'t start using your head. You just use... What, you start listening to me now? Stop it! Stop! Stop! All right. Fuller, violence is not the answer to our problems, all right? It\\'s not. And I\\'m not just saying that because I\\'m \"scared\" of you. Okay? Because I\\'m... Whoa! What is that?! I am calling McDonald. Where\\'s Joel? I can\\'t go into public like this. Hey, how are you? Joel! - Hello. - You knocked my highlights off. What happened? - Look! This will take an hour. - Tell me about it. - Misting. Ladies. I think we should call the networks and set up another press conference. You know what? You\\'re absolutely right. Okay. I\\'m gonna go back up to the room. I\\'m gonna get a little spritz, a little refresh... It\\'s her. It\\'s her. Hold this. We are not questioning Dolly. - It\\'s not the real Dolly, so relax. I know it\\'s not. Stay away from her. I\\'m an adult. I can act as I please. You leave Dolly alone! Get your hands off me! Thank you very much. Excuse me, fake Dolly! Hi. Hello. FBI here. Yeah, I just would love to have a few words with you if I could. - Hi, how are you? - How you doing? Yeah, thank you for your support. Yeah. Get off me, you stalker! Get off me! Stalker? Fake Dolly! Where are you going? Hart! - Fake Dolly! Gracie! Stop! Hart, stop! Dolly Parton! What is it about this outfit that is making everyone so uncooperative? Gracie Hart! Blondie! No pictures. Hold on. Excuse me. I need for you to... - Open! Just... Watch it! Someone stop that fake Dolly! Hart, stop! Stop her! Excuse me. Excuse me. Please don\\'t make me do something that\\'s not ladylike. Okay, FBI. I have just a few questions for you. Me first! What is the matter with you? Miss Hart! What are you doing? Miss Parton is here for a press conference to announce her world tour. There is no world tour, and this is not Dolly Parton. Okay, look. Look, these are absolutely... What are you...? What is she doing? That hurts! - Why did you run? - Some crazy woman was chasing me! Excuse me. Miss Parton, \"Here You Come Again\" was my wedding song. - I just love you. - Honey, let\\'s leave Miss Parton alone. I love that song too. That was an amazing song! Why are you on top of me? I\\'m just a big fan. It\\'s also on CNN... ...MSNBC... ...and Al Jazeera. - I was trying to question her regarding... - You think you\\'re something special. I have got 75 people working on this case day and night. - They don\\'t stack up to you, do they? - The limo driver... I want you off this case. Well, I am sorry, sir, but you don\\'t have the authority to kick me off this case. Mm-mm. I could call the director, who happens to be a close, personal friend. Or I could even call the president, who invited me to dinner at his house. And I think we know which house I\\'m talking about, don\\'t we? It\\'s white. Actually, it\\'s like eggshell... I am the SAC in Las Vegas. I have authority over my territory. And when the director sees you on national television... ...nose-tackling his favorite country-western singer, he\\'ll back me up. Now, I want the two of you on a jet back to New York today. Do you think you can handle that tiny, little task, Foreman? Of course, sir. Okay. I got you the last three seats on the flight. Janine, Pam, you have to take the next one. Sorry. - Because we\\'re just hair and makeup? - We could go to the bar. For five hours? Okay. The director\\'s gonna call me back any minute. Good. And when he does... ...you can let him know that chasing Dolly was all your dumb idea. Oh, really? Well, let me ask you something, Chatty Cathy. What happened to, \"Team, yo. You and me in it together\"? Don\\'t do that again. And that was before you ruined my career. - What? - Yeah. McDonald said that if I screwed this up, then I\\'m out of the Bureau. Thanks. What are you complaining about? You\\'re not famous. Nobody knows who you are. You\\'re a private failure. But you see this? You see this? Everybody knows this. So if I screw up, I\\'m failure face. Get your failure face out of my ruined-career face... ...because right now I\\'m mad, and I\\'m pissed off and mad, so... Oh, okay, hold on. So you\\'re double mad? Well, if you\\'re double mad, then I am mad, mad, mad. All right? Top that one. - Back off! - You gotta stop hitting me... ...because every time you do, it wrinkles! Ladies, ladies! Calm down. Sit down. Sit down. I\\'m gonna separate the two of you. Mad, mad, mad, mad. Four. I can still shoot her from here. You have to lean over me to get to her. Now, let\\'s calm down and try to focus on the positive. We have our health. - You\\'ll be getting frequent-flyer miles. - Foreman, what did you just say? Frequent-flyer miles. It\\'s a great way to get upgrades. No, no, no, you said that she... You said that she would have to lean over you to get to me. Look at what the kidnappers are doing. This guy is leaning over Cheryl to get to Stan. Why would they do that if they were after Cheryl? Okay, and look at this. Look at this. They\\'re not even touching her. No, she\\'s just stuck in there, like a little Cheryl sandwich. She\\'s... She\\'s... Oh, my God. She is grabbing them. I taught her that wristlock. - She\\'s not defending herself. She\\'s... - She\\'s defending Stan. Maybe they weren\\'t after Cheryl. Maybe they were after Stan. Why? The man can\\'t sing, but is that a crime? - That\\'s what we\\'re gonna find out. - Look, they\\'re boarding. - Let it go, Hart. - Oh, Fuller, come on. Wake up and smell the iced Venti Caramel Macchiato. I\\'m onto something. - Okay. Tell Collins. - We have issues. He won\\'t listen to me. - And you think I am? - Yes. Psst! Yes, I do. You don\\'t get your miles unless you\\'re actually on the flight, so come on. - You\\'re on your own, Hart. No, I\\'m not. Because even though you refuse to dress up or separate those eyebrows... ...you cannot deny that you have a style. Gray suit, white shirt, masculine shoes. You are an FBI agent. And that is all that you have. And like you said, if you go back there now, you are out of the Bureau. Now boardjng all rows on flight 624 to New York. Fuller, I am begging you. Do you have any idea how painful this is for me? Usually, they give an epidural for this kind of agony. Fuller, please, just... Just, please. Hart, you better be right, or I swear... You\\'re gonna kick my skinny white ass and break my face. I know. I already paid for the seats... ...and I don\\'t get reimbursed unless you\\'re on the flight. Please. I\\'m letting you spend the night because I wanna keep my eyes on you. Tomorrow, you guys are on a flight. As soon as we go to the home. - What home? Whose home? Where Stan Fields\\' mother lives. She was the last to see him. Maybe she knows something. No way. You\\'re supposed to be in New York. You\\'re famous. Everyone will recognize you. Not to worry. Joel will come up with something to make us blend. - He\\'s a born blender. - I don\\'t believe this. You guys are lucky Janet had to work late... ...because if she was here, she would not put up with any of this. Now, Janet... Janet runs a tight ship. I love shopping in Vegas. Where else can you find a 24-hour wiggery? To work. Hey, hey! That\\'s my room! - Wow. I never would have suspected. - What? You as a dainty-travel-pillow type. - It\\'s hypoallergenic. - Oh, really? - And what are you allergic to? - Besides you? Shellfish, cats, dogs, any type of animal dander... ...dairy products, dust... - You should be in a plastic bubble. - Plastic. - That explains it. - Explains what? - Why you\\'re so angry. - I\\'m not angry, I\\'m allergic. All I was saying was that it just, you know... ...couldn\\'t have been easy being a kid sick like that all the time. I mean, not being able to have a dog or a cat or ice cream or dust. It wasn\\'t bad. - Really? - I got to hang out with my dad a lot. He was a sportswriter, so we got to watch all the games on TV together... ...and he taught me how to box. Taught me how to take care of myself. Well, I\\'m sure he was very proud of you. Was? Uh... Yeah, I read on your file that he died before you became an agent. - You read my file? - I had to make sure you weren\\'t crazy. - Yeah. Turns out you can\\'t trust a file. - Yeah, well, I guess you can\\'t. I thought I would\\'ve liked a tomboy from Jersey whose mom was an agent. - You read my file? - Worse. Your book. Had to make sure you weren\\'t crazy. Turns out you can\\'t trust a book. Yeah, they brought in this writer... ...who managed to turn the entire story into some fairy tale. In the first draft, he made it sound like my mother died... ...single-handedly saving the country, when all it was was just, you know, a... It was just a drug bust gone bad. Sorry. Sorry about your dad. But I\\'m mostly sorry you had to read that book. I like the pictures, though. Oh, really? Yeah, especially that one with that guy. What was his name? Which one? The agent, the one that was in the pageant with you. Eric Matthews. Yeah. He was hot. I guess. Night, Hart. Good night, Fuller. Foreman, we\\'re in. Approaching target. Welcome to Prestige Assisted Living. How can I help you? Hi, I\\'m Joel Flammenbaum, and this is my mother. Ida. Ida Flammenbaum. How are you? This is my lovely nurse, Rosie. - Hello. She\\'s not very social... ...but she gives a superb enema if you\\'re feeling a little clogged up. Are you interested in touring our facilities? Yes, we are very interested. I can\\'t wait to get rid of her. Don\\'t listen to him. He\\'s a mama\\'s boy. Come here, cutie. Let me fix your tie. - He\\'s such a mama\\'s boy. - Mom, not now. Now, that is a mama\\'s boy\\'s face. That\\'s a mama\\'s boy\\'s face. Do you have a euthanasia program? We just need to fill out some forms. If you\\'ll just give me one minute. Keep the receptionist busy. We\\'re gonna ask some questions... ...assuming we can find anyone that can hear. Hold my purse. Let\\'s roll, Rosie. Hello there. I\\'m Ida Flammenbaum. I am new. Well, I\\'m not new. - And you are? - Buster Harrison. Oh, Buster. Is it true that Stan Fields\\' mother is residing here? Yes, she\\'s right over there. Carol? This is Ida. She wanted to meet you. - Ow! - Oh, Buster, I\\'m so sorry. Go give Buster one of your famous foot massages. Hey. While I\\'m at it, how about one of my famous enemas? Can you get two of them in a day? Mrs. Fields, Mrs. Fields. Sounds like the cookie. It\\'s very funny. Not after you\\'ve heard it for 30 years, Ida. I\\'m sure. I just wanted to come over here... ...and tell you how very sorry I am about the kidnapping. Oh, yeah, poor, poor Stanley. But he had it coming. Really? Well, from what I hear from everyone, he\\'s such a mensch. - I mean, who would wanna hurt him? - Well, you know, he loved the sluts. He...? He loved the sluts? The sluts! - The sluts. - The slut machines. - Ah. Slot machines. When he wasn\\'t doing that pageant, he was here in Vegas, gambling. I don\\'t know where he gets that from. You were saying... You were saying that your son, he loves the slot machines. I begged him to stop. I said to him: \"One of these days, gambling\\'s gonna get you in a lot of trouble. \" I lent him 600 bucks, I never got it back. I was ready to break his legs, and I\\'m his mother. Wait till the loan sharks get ahold of him. The loan sharks every time will get you. They\\'re very... Loan shark. - It\\'s the loan sharks. - Ida, you can walk! - Praise Jesus! - Moses. Moses, I am walking again. Sign me up for this place. I love it here, and the men make me all fakakta. Jeff, why are we here? Because we had a deal, Gracie. Okay, look. Deals are like pearls. They\\'re lovely, but they fall apart all the time. I\\'m grabbing your luggage. We\\'re going to the airport. Didn\\'t you hear what Stan\\'s mother said? Yes, I did. \"Sluts. \" I wrote it down, all right? \"Loan shark. \" That\\'s why we have to get back to the Bureau... ...do a CHC printout of every loan shark in Vegas. Come on. You can\\'t go to the Bureau. You are supposed to be in New York. Exactly. And that is why you can go and you can take... - No. No. No. No! - Okay, look, Jeff... ...I don\\'t like to use my gun unless it\\'s in self-defense or at a good sale... ...but if you don\\'t go back and get those CHCs, I have to... You know, I have to shoot you. You won\\'t do it, Gracie. This is what I like. Learning to work together. A little \"Ebony & Ivory\" action. - Guys, I can\\'t do it. - Stop being a wuss, Foreman. Be a man! Yeah, like Fuller. Okay. But this is it. Then we\\'re going to the airport. Enough\\'s enough. Absolutely. Okay. - I\\'m putting my foot down. He\\'s putting his foot down. Got some high-def tapes for the new ransom video. More production value. Bro... ...maybe we should get out now. Are you kidding? We got them where we want them. They\\'re getting nervous. But if they don\\'t agree to our demands, we... That\\'s why we\\'re making a new one. We\\'re gonna have Miss United States say we\\'re moving up the deadline. And either we get our cash wired to an offshore account tonight, or she\\'s dead. So, what do we do? Shoot them? No. We\\'re gonna kill them and get a little payback at the hotel. You know how location is everything in Vegas, right? Well, after we pull this off, Treasure Island\\'s gonna be a big, ugly crime site. - What, are we just gonna drive in? - No. Just before the show starts, we\\'ll tie them up at the bottom of the boat. That ship sinks, so long, Miss United States. - Hey, guys. Foreman. Nice job with Dolly Parton. We\\'ve been after Dolly for a long time, but it took you to finally bring her in. - I can\\'t do this. - Yes, you can. Remember what Louis Vuitton said, \"It\\'s in the bag. \" You can do this. Okay. He can\\'t do this. Going down like a fat woman on a greased fire pole. I heard that. I\\'m going into the database. - Great. Just keep us filled in. - Okay. Someone left a can of soda by the keyboard. I\\'m sweating profusely. I think I left my oven on. Okay. We\\'re printing. Awesome, Jeff. Awesome. You did it. - Fuller just lost a bet. - Not over yet. Agent Collins, if you could just... Agent Collins! All right, this is gonna be the last question. Yes, go ahead. What happens if tomorrow\\'s deadline comes and goes... ...and there\\'s no break in the case? We\\'ve spoken with the pageant administration. We will not negotiate. They have one choice, and that is to free Miss Frazier and Mr. Fields, and that\\'s it. - No more questions. Thank you. Just one more question! - That\\'s not right. - What\\'s not right? No. It must be the height. - Jeff. Jeff, what\\'s up? What\\'s up? - It\\'s Janet. I\\'m not sure, but I think she\\'s with... With what? With you? Withholding evidence? With child? With what? With what?! With Collins. Foreman! Foreman. - What are you doing with CHCs? - They\\'re for the Miss United States case. - What about that case? - Were the two of you just...? Jeff, chill! Okay, you\\'ve just gotta get out of there. Foreman, why do you have those rap sheets? A general database check to see if there were any suspects worth pursuing. I was doing a general database check... ...to see if there were suspects worth pursuing. - Were you two just...? - This isn\\'t a general database check. This is a felony-specific search for loan sharks. You noticed on the kidnapping video... ...the assailants were attempting to abduct Stan Fields. - I want an answer. - Say it again. I want an answer. - On the kidnapping video, the assailants... - What is wrong with you? - Say it faster. - What\\'s wrong with you? The assailants were attempting to abduct Stan Fields... ...and you found that Stan Fields had a gambling problem. Water. I saw the assailants attempting to abduct Stan Fields... ...so I pursued the matter and found he has a gambling problem. You pursued the matter further? Under whose authority? - You\\'ve gotta lie, Foreman. - Foreman, I am waiting. Tell him I\\'m dizzy from smashing a suspect\\'s head into the wall... ...and I can\\'t remember. That always works. You know what I like to do? Faint. We can\\'t do this, guys. He\\'s honest. - Jeff, tell him the truth. - The truth? - Are you sure? - Am I sure I want the truth? Foreman, I want you to get a CAT scan. I didn\\'t get this information. Agents Hart and Fuller did. - How? They\\'re in New York. Well, at the airport... They\\'re not in New York. Hart? - Yes, sir. - I assume that Agent Fuller is with you. - Yes, sir. And Joel. Hello, Walter. I want all of you in the situation room now. That is what I want. That\\'s right. - Sir. I want you to know that none of this was Agent Foreman\\'s idea. Oh, I know, I know. Because Foreman doesn\\'t have any ideas. This has you written all over it, Hart. You\\'ve really gotta do things your way, don\\'t you? Well, Dolce and Gabbana always said we should express our personal style, sir. - They were talking about a vest... You\\'re no super agent. You\\'re a loose cannon who lucked into being in the right place at the right time. You don\\'t have to be that hard on her. She was... Oh, I am so glad you\\'re with her on this, Fuller... ...because you two are going down together. The works. - Review board, departmental hearings... - Sir, we got another message e-mailed. Show me. - Play it. - This is Cheryl Frazier. Hi, again. The deadline has been changed. It\\'s not tomorrow, it\\'s tonight. The kidnappers are going to fax instructions to the pageant... ...where the 5 million should be sent. And if they don\\'t receive it, I\\'m going to be dead. And I know it\\'s a lot of money, but it\\'s my booty on the line. - So... - This is Stan Fields... ...and she\\'s too young to die. And I\\'m not as old as I look. So please. We also got this, sir. A clerk at a print store saw a suspicious man e-mail a message an hour ago. Aerial spotted a pickup truck matching the vehicle in the kidnapping video... ...heading south on 15. You see this? This is real information. Not Dolly Parton and senior homes. That\\'s how we do it in Vegas. I want roadblocks on I-15 and increased surveillance at the airports. Got it. Foreman? Yes, sir. I want you to put Hart, Fuller and Joel on the first flight back to New York. To make sure there\\'s no problem, Okun and Hills will be going with you. If you get it wrong this time, you are fired. Do you copy? That won\\'t be necessary, because nobody is getting fired... ...and nobody is leaving. Wrong again, Hart! And if I ever see you in my city again, you can forget about the review board. I will have you arrested for obstruction of justice... ...and you can spend a very long time in Las Vegas, in a jail cell. You know what? You know what? I have had just about enough of your rudeness and insensitivity and cologne. Oh, really? And what are you gonna do about it? Call the director? Go ahead. I got off the phone with him. - Know what he said? - What? He said that you are the biggest mistake he ever made. And he said, and I quote... ...that you \"have become a liability and an embarrassment to the Bureau. \" Now, get going. Okun. It\\'s Collins. Yes, sir, we\\'re at the airport. - Is he mad at me? - Sorry, sir, I\\'m losing you. Does he wanna talk to me? - Foreman! Leave him alone! Now boarding, flight 624 to New York. Yeah. I was looking at your ad... ...and I was wondering if you have a Dolly Parton performer. No? Oh. Okay. Hart, maybe you were right about Dolly. Maybe you just had the wrong Dolly. - You don\\'t know if they have a Dolly. - They don\\'t. I called there, and they said the only place in Vegas... ...that has a Dolly Parton performer is the Oasis Drag Club. Just get on the plane, Fuller. - Do you wanna save Cheryl or not? - I\\'m gonna get her killed. What\\'s up with you? What happened to that girl from the pageant? She\\'s gone. Her boyfriend, Eric Matthews, broke up with her. It was absolutely devastating. Is that what happened to you? Oh, that\\'s pathetic. Come on. Plenty of guys have broken up with me. You just beat them up and move on. Only you and Foreman turn it into some big soap opera. Of course you don\\'t understand how Jeff feels, because he\\'s not a cyborg. He knows what it feels like to be rejected and humiliated. To feel your heart ripped open... ...because you finally took a chance on that relationship... ...and it wound up confirming your worst fears... ...that you are worthless and not worth caring about. So you may not understand, but that is how Jeff feels. Matthews was right to dump you. - Take that back. - I would say, \"Make me,\" but you can\\'t. Okay. All right. Well... ...then I just have two things to say. - What? - First of all, we are in a public place... ...so we have to display a sense of decorum, and second of all... ...I might break a nail. - Oh! - Take it back! Take it back. Jeez! All the stuff that Collins said back there was a bunch of bull. You figured out the limo driver was dirty. You figured out that they were after Stan. You\\'re not lucky. You\\'re good. Thank you. But take it back, take it back, take it back. Okay, I\\'ll take it back if you admit one thing. What? Oh, God! For the first time in a long time, you feel like the real Gracie Hart. Oh, my God. Straining muscles cutting off someone\\'s air supply. Sweating like a pig. You\\'re right, I feel like a woman again. Good. I take it back. Now release. You first. - On three. - One. Two. Three. Oh, no. Okay, just to show you I trust you. Now boarding all passengers for flight 624 to New York. Thanks. All right. Okay, kids, time for the circus to leave town. Come on, girls. How are we gonna get rid of these guys? I don\\'t know. But it has to be subtle. Keep it moving. God! Ooh, Lordy! Ladies\\' time. I have the cramps. I have to... I have to go to the bathroom. Hart. There\\'s one on the plane. I know, but, guys, PMS for me means \"pants might shred,\" so I gotta... - Forget it, Hart. - Guys, you don\\'t understand. I bloat. I take on water, and I expand, and I may change the cabin pressure of that plane. I gotta take her to the bathroom. I need a tampon! - You heard her, we got a agent down. We need tampons! - I\\'m not getting those. - I don\\'t even do it for my wife. This is a job for a real man. Any particular brand? Any brand. - Janet liked the ones in the blue box... ...with the daisies on it. You\\'re really not following this, are you? Something\\'s up. Tampons. Give them a couple minutes. Zero-one, what do you got? No movement. Good to go. - Copy that. Griffin, go to green. FBI! Get down! Nobody move! Clear! Sir, it\\'s empty. You heard the FBI, bro. They\\'re not gonna pay. They\\'ll pay, or we\\'ll kill Fields and Frazier. Let\\'s see them explain that at their press conference. How\\'d you know they\\'d come? - Choppers. Twice a day they fly to Vegas to do traffic reports... ...but that last one didn\\'t come at rush hour. I knew it was them. I said, stay down! Griffin, secure a 500-foot perimeter and get me something. Tire tracks, cigarette butts for DNA, but something. You got it, sir. Sir, I just got a call from Agent Okun. Hart didn\\'t get on the plane. I need a minute with Agent McCarren. Well, apparently, she faked a case of cramps and escaped with Fuller. Where\\'s your idiot boyfriend? Ex-boyfriend! He was on his way to buy tampons for her when he left with them. Oh, well, how very, very considerate. I don\\'t have time for this. She is ruining my investigation! She\\'s just trying to get another bestseller out of this, Walter. This should be your bestseller. You\\'re right. I want you to find her and Fuller and arrest them for obstruction of justice. We\\'re in the clear. Where are they? Someone\\'s gonna see us. They said they had to get ready for the mission. Yeah? Well, we are running out of time. Come on, Laverne and Shirley, move it! - Ready? - Armed. And fabulous, except for the... Let\\'s go. Jeff, you got the rap sheets. All right, this guy... This guy\\'s still in prison. This guy is too short to match the surveillance video. This guy is... This guy\\'s brothers with this guy. Burglary, grand theft auto. Hold on. How are we supposed to get to Dolly? Uh, we go to the drag club, flash our badges and interrogate her. And if she doesn\\'t cooperate? Violence. I have some catching up to do. Then she\\'s gonna call the cops and say that she was attacked by Gracie Hart. Then Collins is gonna find out about it. We\\'ll all end up in the big house. - We gotta blend in. - Not to worry. I know what to do. I\\'ve been waiting for this moment my entire life. Let\\'s go over this. We\\'re not leaving until we find and interrogate Dolly Parton. That\\'s something I never thought I\\'d say. Jeff? I\\'m backup. If Dolly tries to flee, I got her. I\\'m gonna check out the dressing rooms. I\\'m really just here to have a good time. Oh, God, I just don\\'t see why I couldn\\'t be Tina. - You don\\'t see that? - I am the Tina Turner fan. Ladies, knock it off. We are here to get information. Earpieces in? All right, let\\'s move. - I wanna go in there. - Go backstage? Liza plus two, you\\'re up next. Hello. I\\'m Elizabeth Taylor. What do we have here? - Tina and, uh...? - Coco. Where do you think you\\'re going? The only people who go to the dressing rooms are our regulars... ...and our open-mikers after they pass round one. Could you step aside, Coco? And you are? She\\'s classy, she\\'s lovely, she\\'s perfect to a T. My very favorite, Liza with a Z. - Foreman. Jeff? Hi, it\\'s Janet. I just wanted to talk to you about us. - Now\\'s not a good time. - Is that Liza Minnelli in the background? Yeah. On the radio. I\\'m just home, listening to Liza. I don\\'t want it to end this way. I know that you\\'re mad at me, but I still care about you... - Got it. - Just give me a call if you get a chance. Two-block radius of Koval and Harmon. Liza Minnelli. I know where he is. Let\\'s move. Oh, you go, Miss Minnelli! You are definitely on to the next round. Why don\\'t you go rest up backstage. Wasn\\'t she wonderful? Bad news. We want in those dressing rooms, we have to perform. I am not going out there as a woman pretending to be a man... ...pretending to be Tina Turner. I can\\'t afford therapy on my salary. What other choice do we have? No! No! You can do this. Okay, you can because you are Sam Fuller, FBI... ...and nothing scares you. I am Gracie Hart... ...and at this moment, I am also Big Bird, and nothing scares me... ...except losing Cheryl because having a friend like her, having any friend... ...for me is a really, really rare thing, okay? Okay, but I am not singing. - Fabulous Tina Turner! Everything is gonna be okay. Just be Tina-ish. - You can do Tina. - Just take it. - I am not singing. - Just take it. How come he gets to go first? I was here before him! It\\'s all here on my list, in alphabetical order. Tina, then Tina, then Tina. And you\\'re all doing the same song anyway. What\\'s the difference? Hit it. Smile. - You smiling? - I am smiling. Come on, boys! Bring back Liza! Thank you and good night. No, no, we have to stay here. Stay here. Shake. Shake. Oh, shoot. He\\'s gonna give us the hook. Sell it, Tina. Rolling. - I found Dolly! - What\\'s he saying? What? Tinas of the world, unite! Take the stage! Shake! I found Dolly. He picked me up at the bar... ...and invited me to dressing room five. I\\'m glad I wore the heels. Joel found Dolly in room five. - Got it. We need a big finish. I should take my top off. No, we need a good big finish. - Pick me up. - No. FBI. Pick me up! Settle down, settle down. - Smile! - Well, I personally didn\\'t love it... ...but what\\'s love got to do with it? The crowd decides and tonight the drinks must be strong... ...because this Tina\\'s moving on to the next round! - Whoo! - Come on, come on! All right, he said dressing room number five. It\\'s that one right there. Joel, let us handle this. He invited me! I\\'ll get you his phone number. Hello? Can I help you boys? What do you know about the Miss United States kidnapping? - What? - Tom Abernathy, the limo driver. You paid him 200 bucks to park far away from the entrance to the home. Why? I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about. Please leave. Normally I would calmly interrogate you, but I\\'m kind of in a rush. - I don\\'t know anything! - Talk! - Please! It wasn\\'t me. It was some guy. - What guy? I met him when I was a keno girl at Treasure Island. I borrowed money from him and couldn\\'t pay it back. - He said he would dump me off... - What was his name?! Ken? Cal? Karl? I don\\'t remember. - Shh, shh. - He didn\\'t tell me his last name. Karl. - Karl Steele was on that sheet. One of the brothers. Lou and Karl Steele, armed robbery, grand theft auto. You met him at Treasure Island. - God. Let\\'s go. Where are we going? - Treasure Island, where they took them. - How do you know? Dolly said the Steele brothers were pirates. Janet is here with backup. I repeat, Janet is here. Jeff? - Where is she? - Where is who? - You are a lousy liar, Jeff. Yeah. And you\\'re a good one. - How are we gonna get out of here? - I don\\'t know, but it has to be subtle. Ladies and gentlemen... ...the next show will be in 20 minutes. Okay, let\\'s go. You both keep your mouths shut, or you\\'re dead. The Steele brothers were fired from the Treasure Island show. Cheryl said something about her booty being on the line. She would never refer to her ass as a booty or refer to her ass, period. She calls it a po-po. - Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse us! FBI. We need your car. Well, that\\'s not gonna happen. Get lost. Hey! Hart, Hart! Too much! Yeah, I know, but now I kind of see why you enjoy it so much. You are fine citizens, and you will get your car back. Thank you very much. All right. Okay, here I come. Ow! Ow! - I\\'m sorry. I\\'m gonna turn. Okay. Sorry, sorry. What did Joel do, weld this thing on...? Just keep quiet, do as you\\'re told, and nobody gets hurt. I believe him. Don\\'t you believe him? - He wouldn\\'t lie about a thing like that. - Will you just shut up?! Jeff. Jeff! Gracie and Sam went to... Go on, if you don\\'t wanna spend a few years in prison... ...for obstruction of justice. Which prison? Just in case I don\\'t get a chance to say it... ...I\\'m sorry for getting on you about that whole Matthews thing. It was none of my business. That\\'s all right. I scared him off. But the thing is, right, he came back to save me. I mean, why would somebody come back to save someone if they didn\\'t have... ...feelings? You know? I\\'m sure he liked you, but maybe he was just doing his job. Maybe. Men. Can\\'t live with them, you can\\'t... - No, that\\'s about it. - Yep. Okay, hold on. Come on! - Okay! Clearly that\\'s not working. - Don\\'t start with me, Tina. Are we gonna die? Not if you develop gills in the next five minutes. Let\\'s go back through the casino. Okay. I\\'m gonna take this side, you take that... Okay. The Steele brothers. Lou! Lou and Karl Steele, freeze! FBI! Freeze! Freeze! Keep going. Move. Move, move. We\\'re gonna need more help in sector four. Where are Cheryl and Stan? - Where are they? - You\\'re breaking my wrist. - Where are Cheryl and Stan? - They\\'re at the bottom of the boat. What boat?! Lou! I\\'m coming, bro! I got your back. - No, no. I got this. You go for Cheryl. - You sure? - I\\'ve got this! Okay. Twenty dollars on the sister. You\\'re good. I\\'m gonna enjoy this. - Nothing left to talk about, lady. - I\\'m not gonna talk. I\\'m gonna sing! Hope you weren\\'t planning on reproducing. I\\'m coming! I\\'m coming! Gracie! Everything\\'s gonna be okay. - I\\'ve got you. Can you swim? Can I swim? I made junior lifesaver at Camp Mondago. I was captain of the miniature golf team. - Stan, just go! Go, go! - Not without Cheryl! - Stan, I have her! Go! Go! - Okay. - Where? - The back is blocked. - Go to the nearest porthole. Right here. Oh, okay. There\\'s a cannon in my porthole! Pull! Come on, hurry! - My God! It\\'s moving! - Go! - Here I go. Here I go. Gracie! Hart jumped in a few minutes ago. - Okun, Hills, help him! - I can\\'t swim, sir. I gave you an order. Gracie... - Miss United States. - You can call me Cheryl. It\\'s okay, we got you. We got you. So all of our clues... ...eventually led us here. Here she is. There\\'s Ms. Hart! Ms. Hart, this way! Nice work. Thank you. - Proud to have you on our team. - That\\'s great. - Thank you very much. Oh, you\\'ve gotta be kidding. You threatened to throw her in jail. Get on your knees and thank her for solving a crime you couldn\\'t solve. - Take your little handshake and put it... - Okay, Mr. Living-on-the-Edge. We\\'re all on the same team. It\\'s all right. I guess he doesn\\'t wanna keep the press waiting. Gracie! Gracie! Oh, you must be getting really tired of saving my life. No, no, it\\'s good exercise. Oh, and thank you for the \"booty\" tip. I felt so uncomfortable saying it, but it was an emergency. - And I knew you\\'d be listening. - Yeah, well, what are friends for, right? And speaking of friends, I would like to introduce you to Mr. Jeff Foreman. Oh, we already met. He\\'s a wonderful swimmer. Well, you\\'re so buoyant. Okay. Come here. I gotta talk to you for a second. Just a couple words of advice. Don\\'t bring up the Poconos, at least for a couple of months. Okay. Now go get him. Gracie, I\\'m so proud of you. Oh, thank you. And even without the makeup and the gloss and all my magic... ...you\\'ve never looked more beautiful than you do now. Neither have you. - Oh, thank you. Gracie. - Oh, Stan. I\\'m so sorry. - It\\'s okay, Stan. - This was all my fault. - I have this weakness for... - For gambling. I talked to your mother. - You talked to my mother? - Yeah. - Does she want her 600 back? - Yeah, she wants that back. But she\\'s very proud of you. You just need to stay away from the sluts... Slots for a little while. Okay? Okay. Let\\'s go. Over here, sir. How\\'d you do it? How you doing? Good. You? - Good. Hey, you kicked some po-po out there. - Thanks. You too. - Thank you. And, uh, thanks... Thanks for coming back for me. - It\\'s not like I love you or anything. - I know. - I was just doing my job. - I know. But I gotta admit... ...when you were saying that stuff back there about not having any friends... ...I know what you mean by that. You got a friend. Yeah. Agent Johnson, over in Mail Fraud? I think he likes you. Yeah. No, but if, you know... If that doesn\\'t work out, then... ...you always got: You know what? She\\'s right down there. You can talk to her. Ms. Hart! Ms. Hart! Is this going in your next book? Hey! Hey! Guys, guys, guys. I have two things to say. First of all, there\\'s not gonna be a next book. Second... No comment. Ever again. Ever. Thank you, thank you. Not listening. Not listening. Mr. Collins, characterize the investigation for us, sir. I never gave up because the word \"quit\" is not in my vocabulary. Neither is \"failure,\" \"A for effort,\" \"abandon ship\"... And that is how we do it in New York. Listen up. Got a change in the assignment schedule. Hart\\'s gonna be partnering with Fuller. And the mayor\\'s youth-crime prevention program is back on. - The director wants... - You\\'re my new partner. You have to like me. And back me up if someone\\'s shooting at me. Not necessarily. - Want some? - Let\\'s get to work. Keep your heads up. We\\'re partners now, but there\\'s something I need to take care of alone. - Are you sure you don\\'t need backup? - This is solo. - So we cool? - Cool. I\\'m gonna roll. Hi. I\\'m sorry to interrupt. I\\'m Gracie Hart of the FBI... ...and our information indicated that a Priscilla was doing a book report on me... ...so I thought I would come by and see if I could be of any assistance. Oh, my God. Hey, Priscilla. Well, I suppose we can skip ahead to English... ...and let Priscilla give her report in honor of our guest. Let\\'s put our math books away. - Hi. - Thanks for coming. Um... Since we\\'re in class, uh... ...I would like to share with you something I learned recently. A little lesson, which is... ...people may care about people who care about themselves... ...but I just don\\'t really care about those people. - Not really following you. - No? Come here. We\\'ll just have to take this. And then we\\'ll take those. And then we\\'ll just... There you are. Now go do your book report. Kids! Quiet! Hey, hey, hey, put a lid on it, all right... ...or I\\'m gonna have to rough you guys up a little, okay? Miss Hart? Until you admit that fighting is never the answer. Ever. Because what do we really want? Anyone? Nobody? Nobody knows? Priscilla, what do we want? World peace. And the strength to hold fast to your beliefs... ...while society\\'s forcing you to conform to a Barbie-doll image... ...know what I\\'m saying? You don\\'t know what I\\'m saying? Okay, well... ...it\\'s mostly... It\\'s mostly world peace. On the video, you noticed the assailants were attempting to abduct Stan Fields... ...and you pursued the matter \"furder\"... Fur... Okay. Some savings bonds and a 1901... No, it\\'s not quite that old. It\\'s a 2001... You\\'re the one... Damn that line! Joel has come up with this very... Sedate? Yeah, say it, yeah. Foreman! - Watch it. I\\'m handling breasts here. - Yours? You pursued the matter furder... Further... - \"Furder. \" \"Furder\"? Not gonna happen. - What other choice do we have? On the kidnapping video, you noticed that the... You know what to say, Jeff. - What\\'s your name? - Foreman. Foreman? Okay. Fur ball. Little further. - Back up, back up, back up. Feel... I\\'m upset... Who are you? What am...? What am I doing here? Stan. Don\\'t untie me. I have another 15 minutes. You mentioned something about breakfast? - Unprofessional. Still rolling. - Oh, my... Bro! Your mask! We need a bunch of rodents. Squirrels, wombats. - Can I go back to the trailer? Yeah, yeah. - You like the pirate. You wanna kiss him. Shut up!'\n",
      " \"        urlLink www.thisisnotporn.com  is possibly the weirdest website I've ever seen. Well, maybe not, but it is still quite haunting. When you first go there, you're greeted by a picture of an oven (t0wN iDi0t: What a wonderful oven.), as well as a pop-up window titled 'SAVE HIM!!' containing the text 'HELP I AM DROWNING!!'. After you click on the oven, then you'll really be intrigued. On the next page, entitled 'afg bbb bai bab adc aig bba baa adc ahd bab bab aef', there is the phrase 'Asia Awaits'. How lovely. Blame the Koreans. Following the phrase is a mass of garbled text. Select all of it, and paste it in Notepad with Word Wrap off. You will get:  'Alexander cut me. An oracle predicted me. A future king tied me. Say my name to clear your path.'  It turns out that the answer is 'Gordian'. I learned this after a heavy dose of Google. So, if you haven't already, click on Asia Awaits. The username is 'Alexander', and the password is the answer to the riddle, 'Gordian'.  On the next page is a Scandinavian import furniture truck. Click on it, and you will receive the following text in a new window. And its in a different language! Yay! It translates into 'The boy will only die'. Weird, huh? Now, the hex within the page says 'To get to the next site, find the place where the boy last died'. Now, we can infer that this probably relates to the drowning mentioned upon entering the site. More research about the picture's location and a drowning reveals that the boy drowned in IJsselmeer, Holland.  Now, you may be a little freaked out by the next page. The  urlLink next page  shows a rusted sign attached to a tree, with eerie background music playing, and is titled 'HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?'. If you let the background music file play once (I think once), a blank alert box pops up. Woah. Anyways, click on the sign. The window will close, and another page in another window will load, but first you need to type another password. WhatALovelyDrapeTheyMake. I have yet to figure that out.  All of this information can be found at  urlLink this page .    \"\n",
      " 'Dr. Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to the president, formerly National Security editor for Breitbart News, spoke with Breitbart News Daily on Monday about the upcoming Supreme Court battle over President Trump’s proposal for a temporary travel ban. [“U. S. Code, U. S. law, is absolutely explicit. 8 U. S. Code 1182 says it is the president’s decision if there is a national security need, to limit, to vet, to even stop the immigration of individuals from certain countries,” Gorka pointed out.  “We inherited  —   this is the irony  —   from the Obama administration a list of nations that were of greatest concern, where there is the caliphate, where there is terrorism. We used that analysis to issue two executive orders, and they have been attacked for overt political reasons,” he said. “There was an attempt made to make these seem as if there was some underhand ulterior motive to do with Islam itself, or to do with a certain racial group, when, of course, that cannot be true  —   because if there were any dread motives, then the fact that the largest Muslim nation, Indonesia, the largest Arab nation, Egypt, are on neither of the executive orders proves the point that this is purely about national security,” he contended. Gorka reported that the latest update on the case is that the Department of Justice has requested to the Supreme Court that they “hear this case, this attempt to block our executive order, as soon as possible. ” “Hopefully, that will be the case, Raheem,” he told SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam. Kassam mentioned the novel legal theory deployed against the executive order that Trump’s rhetoric on the campaign trail a year ago invalidates his exercise of presidential authority by revealing dark motives at odds with the White House justification for the travel ban. “It’s a pattern that we’ve been witnessing now for twenty weeks. It’s very strange,” Gorka said of this reasoning. “I was on CNN for my sins last week and I had to discuss for 16 minutes with the host one tweet by the president, as if a tweet is a policy statement or an executive order,” he recalled. “I think it’s just clutching at straws. I think it’s desperation. The campaign trail is not U. S. policy, so I think it’s desperation on their behalf, and that’s why I think we will succeed. ” Kassam asked if there was any truth to rumors that President Trump would cancel or delay his upcoming state visit to the United Kingdom following a disastrous election for Prime Minister Theresa May. “I really have to use this opportunity, Raheem, to bolster the ‘Breitbart is the factual purveyor’ reality,” Gorka replied. “Let’s go to the horse’s mouth: the prime minister’s office gave a public statement. The queen, Queen Elizabeth, has issued an invitation to the President of the United States. Nothing has changed since that invitation was sent to the White House. Those are the facts of the matter. ” Kassam described it as the latest false   story to generate headlines for a few days, only to be quietly corrected later when the leakers turn out to be wrong. “How is it that they get away with this stuff when if we made one tiny little spelling error or typographical error on Breitbart News, I don’t hear the bleeding end of it?” he asked. “I don’t even think the moniker ‘fake news’ is sufficient at the moment. I think we really have to talk about propaganda,” Gorka observed in response. “But your point is well taken. The lack of consequences for the left in their media has led to the reality where most voters simply don’t care. Look at viewing figures for CNN. Look at how the finances of newspapers like the Washington Post  —   they have to be saved by billionaires because they’re simply not viable in the private market. ”  “Yes, there are double standards, but eventually, at the end of the day, who’s listening to them? Just that echo chamber that Ben Rhodes was so proud of creating,” he said, referring to President Barack Obama’s deputy national security adviser, who has boasted of his ability to manipulate the media. Gorka said the White House planned to spend the coming days talking about economic growth and some big foreign policy stories, such as the diplomatic crisis surrounding Qatar. “Just look at the stock market, look at the U. S. economy. Finally, people are being unfettered, small businesses are being allowed to function in ways that actually make them money and not the government,” he said. “On the national security front, the Qatar situation is fascinating,” he observed. “The president goes to the heart of the Muslim world. He asks for action. Action is taken, and now we have to see the sponsorship of terrorism end. That’s a big one for me, Raheem. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. ']\n",
